LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Call it video blogging for reptiles: conservationists are attaching cameras to the critically endangered Indian gharial, a crocodile-like creature, to understand more about its life in a bid to save it.

Only about 1,000 gharials, who have a characteristically narrow snout, are believed to live in the wild in India’s Chambal and Yamuna rivers. The species is almost extinct in several other neighboring nations, including Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh.

In an attempt to better understand the reptiles’ habitat and life cycle, scientists at the Gharial Conservation Park in Lucknow are using small video cameras for “bio-logging.”

The lightweight cameras are attached to gharials that are released into the wild, where they record pictures every four seconds and monitor movement and behavior.

“It can record diving depths, swimming speed and also the frequency of the movement,” said Katyufoomi Sato, associate professor at Tokyo University whose team developed the camera.

“Once we release the gharials into the wild, they go into the water so after that we cannot observe their behavior. But if we deploy this instrument, we can understand their underwater behavior, and their surrounding microhabitat,” he added.

The camera remains attached to the gharial’s head for four hours before automatically detaching itself. Wardens at the conservation park then collect the device and the data is transferred to a computer for in-depth analysis.

If the project, which is being conducted with the help of the WWF wildlife fund, yields positive results, conservationists plan to release more gharials with cameras into the wild, and the time the device will remain attached to the reptile will also increase to 48 hours.

According to the Gharial Conservation Alliance, illegal fishing, pollution and habitat destruction are the biggest threats to the reptiles which were also historically hunted for their skin and teeth and for use in medicines.","Indian crocodiles ""video blog"" for survival",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdXMtaW5kaWEtZ2hhcmlhbHMvaW5kaWFuLWNyb2NvZGlsZXMtdmlkZW8tYmxvZy1mb3Itc3Vydml2YWwtaWRVU1RSRTVBODBMSTIwMDkxMTA50gE8aHR0cHM6Ly9tb2JpbGUucmV1dGVycy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hbXAvaWRVU1RSRTVBODBMSTIwMDkxMTA5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20091109&t=2&i=12252397&w=1200&r=2009-11-09T110656Z_01_BTRE5A80UVO00_RTROPTP_0_INDIA,2009-11-09,"{'sent': 'A Gharial crocodile rests besides a pond at his enclosure at a crocodile centre in the northern Indian city of Lucknow August 23, 2007.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Lucknow']}}",Gharial
0,"What is the African elephant?

African elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are slightly larger than their Asian cousins and can be identified by their larger ears that look somewhat like the continent of Africa. (Asian elephants have smaller, rounded ears.)

African elephants are a keystone species, meaning they play a critical role in their ecosystem. Also known as ""ecosystem engineers,"" elephants shape their habitat in many ways. During the dry season, they use their tusks to dig up dry riverbeds and create watering holes many animals can drink from. Their dung is full of seeds, helping plants spread across the environment—and it makes pretty good habitat for dung beetles too! In the forest, their feasting on trees and shrubs creates pathways for smaller animals to move through, and in the savanna, they uproot trees and eat saplings, which helps keep the landscape open for zebras and other plains animals to thrive.

African elephants are sometimes categorized into savanna elephants and forest elephants. There are some physical and genetic differences, but scientists are still arguing over whether the differences are big enough to call them separate species. Currently, most still consider them same species, Loxodonta africana.

Trunks and tusks

Elephant ears radiate heat to help keep these large animals cool, but sometimes the African heat is too much. Elephants are fond of water and enjoy showering by sucking water into their trunks and spraying it all over themselves. Afterwards, they often spray their skin with a protective coating of dust.

An elephant's trunk is actually a long nose used for smelling, breathing, trumpeting, drinking, and also for grabbing things—especially a potential meal. The trunk alone contains about 40,000 muscles. African elephants have two fingerlike features on the end of their trunk that they can use to grab small items. (Asian elephants have just one.)

Both male and female African elephants have tusks, which are continuously growing teeth. They use these tusks to dig for food and water and strip bark from trees. Males, whose tusks tend to be larger than females’, also use their tusks to battle one another.

Diet

Elephants eat roots, grasses, fruit, and bark, and they eat a lot of these things. An adult elephant can consume up to 300 pounds of food in a single day. These hungry animals do not sleep much, and they roam over great distances while foraging for the large quantities of food that they require to sustain their massive bodies.

African elephants range throughout the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa and the rainforests of central and West Africa. The continent’s northernmost elephants are found in Sahel area of Mali. The small, nomadic herd of Mali elephants migrates in a circular route through the desert in search of water.

Because elephants eat so much, they’re increasingly coming into contact with humans. An elephant can destroy an entire season of crops in a single night—a huge blow to a farmer, who may want to retaliate. There are a number of conservation programs working with farmers to help them protect their crops (elephants are so smart that they can learn to get around electric fences quickly!) and provide compensation when an elephant does raid them.

Herds

Elephants are matriarchal, meaning they live in female-led groups. The matriarch is usually the biggest and oldest. She presides over a multi-generational herd that includes other females, called cows, and their young. Adult males, called bulls, tend to roam on their own, sometimes forming smaller, more loosely associated all-male groups.

Having a baby elephant is a serious commitment. Elephants have a longer pregnancy than any other mammal—almost 22 months. Cows usually give birth to one calf every two to four years. At birth, elephants already weigh some 200 pounds and stand about three feet tall.

Threats to survival

Poaching for the ivory trade is the biggest threat to African elephants’ survival. Before the Europeans began colonizing Africa, there may have been as many as 26 million. The arrival of Europeans kicked off the commercial ivory trend, in which tusks were used for piano keys, billiards balls, combs, and all kinds of other items. By the early 20th century, elephant numbers had dropped to 10 million. Hunting continued to increase. By 1970, their numbers were down to 1.3 million.

Between 1970 and 1990, hunting and poaching put the African elephant at risk of extinction, reducing its population by another half. Today, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists them as vulnerable to extinction. As few as 400,000 remain today.

Because poachers target elephants for their tusks, these years of violence have also had an expecting result: African elephants are evolving to become tuskless. Studies across the continent have shown that regions with historically higher levels of poaching now have higher than usual proportions of tuskless females. Researchers are still trying to figure out how this evolution could affect the species in the long term.

Compounding the problem is how long it takes for elephants to reproduce. With reproduction rates hovering around 5 to 6 percent, there are simply not enough calves being born to make up for the losses from poaching.

African elephants are also losing their habitat as the human population grows and people convert land for agriculture and development. Elephants need a lot of room to roam, so habitat destruction and fragmentation not only makes it harder for them to find food, water, and each other, but it also puts them in increased conflict with humans—a dangerous prospect for both.

Conservation

African elephants are protected to varying degrees in all the countries of their geographic range. They’re also protected under international environmental agreements, CITES and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species. There have been recent efforts to bring re-legalize the international trade in ivory, but those so far have failed.

Conservation groups and governments have worked to set aside land for wildlife—including corridors that connect those protected lands. Still, researchers believe that up to 70 percent of elephants' range is on unprotected land.

To curb poaching, stopping the illegal trade is key. Advocates have launched campaigns that address both the supply side (poaching) and the demand side (people who buy ivory). There have been some breakthroughs in recent years, especially on the demand side: In 2015, China—believed to be the world’s biggest illegal and legal ivory market—agreed to a “near-complete” ban on the domestic trade of ivory. Since the ban went into effect, public demand for ivory seems to have fallen.

On the supply side, protecting elephants from poaching also requires a local approach. In 2019, a study showed that the suffering of elephants is tied to that of the humans living nearby: Regions with high levels of poverty and corruption are more likely to have higher poaching rates. This suggests that helping communities develop sustainable livelihoods could reduce the lure of poaching.

Stronger law enforcement and reducing corruption are also important.",African elephant,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vYW5pbWFscy9tYW1tYWxzL2EvYWZyaWNhbi1lbGVwaGFudC_SAV1odHRwczovL2FwaS5uYXRpb25hbGdlb2dyYXBoaWMuY29tL2Rpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi9wdWJsaWMvYW1wL2FuaW1hbHMvbWFtbWFscy9hL2FmcmljYW4tZWxlcGhhbnQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/pictures/mammals/a/african-elephant/african-elephant_02.ngsversion.1588861759299.adapt.1900.1.JPG,2010-09-10,"{'sent': 'Currently, most still consider them same species, Loxodonta africana.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Loxodonta']}}",Elephant
0,"NARORA, India (Reuters Life!) - As the sun sets over a serene stretch of the mighty Ganges, a pair of smooth, grey dolphins arch gracefully out of the water, bringing hope that wildlife can again call India’s great river home.

Millions of Indians along the banks of the 2,500 km (1,550 mile)-long Ganges depend on the river, but unchecked levels of agricultural, industrial and domestic waste have poured in over the past decades, threatening the wildlife.

Five kilometers upstream from Narora, a five-hour drive west of New Delhi, the 350 megawatt nuclear power station that put this sleepy town on the map looms as a reminder of India’s unrelenting drive for industrialization.

In Karnabas, a small village just upstream from Narora, a local drama troupe performs for more than 150 villagers.

“Humans are polluting our river!” an actor playing a Hindu god declared, a WWF banner celebrating World Dolphin Day hanging over the makeshift stage.

“The life of our Mother Ganga is endangered! Please do something!”

Distinguishable from its ocean-going cousin by a long, pointed snout, the Ganges dolphin is one of only four freshwater species in the world. The total population across India, Nepal and Bangladesh is estimated at 2,000, down from 4,500 in 1982.

But along a northern stretch of the holy river, a Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) project is leveraging the religious importance of the Ganges for Hindus to teach villagers the virtues of conservation and protection of its sacred water. The upper stretch of the Ganges, from Rishikesh in the foothills of the Himalayas to Ram Ghat in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, holds great religious significance for Hindus.

Locations along the river figure heavily in the Hindu holy text, the Ramayana. A bathe in the river is a rite of passage.

“The religious sensibilities of the people are interlinked with the conservation of the river,” said WWF-India project leader Sandeep Behera as he stood on the river bank in the shadow of a Hindu temple, while young boys chanted hymns on a nearby pier.

“If I ask a local farmer to give up just one afternoon to learn about conservation, he will ask ‘What will I eat in the evening?’,” Behera said.

“Therefore, we found that religious leaders were the way to get the message across.”

PROTECTING THE HOLY RIVER

Vivek Kumar Mishra, a Hindu priest at the riverside Vedic school just outside Karnabas, stresses the importance of protecting the holy river in his lessons.

Local fishermen no longer hunt the dolphins for fear of reprisal from village leaders who have signed up to the WWF project, while a WWF campaign promoting natural fertilizers has dramatically reduced chemical pollution into the river.

“What they (WWF) are doing is working. It’s become very clear that we need to clean the river,” said Ritesh Sharma, a 26 year-old shopkeeper in Karnabas.

Dolphin numbers in the 165 km stretch upstream from Narora have almost trebled over the past 15 years, to an estimated 56 today, according to WWF-India.

There are other encouraging signs.

India’s government recently recognized the Ganges River Dolphin as the country’s national aquatic animal. And last week, the Ministry of Environment and Forests promised to rid the river of untreated sewage and industrial pollution by 2020.

Behera, who began conservation work in Narora as part of his PhD, understands that changing peoples’ attitudes takes time.

“This is not one or two years’ work,” he said. “What you see happening is the result of 15 years of engagement.”",Conservation and religion join to save Ganges dolphin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdXMtaW5kaWEtZG9scGhpbnMvY29uc2VydmF0aW9uLWFuZC1yZWxpZ2lvbi1qb2luLXRvLXNhdmUtZ2FuZ2VzLWRvbHBoaW4taWRVU1RSRTY5UjFTWjIwMTAxMDI40gE8aHR0cHM6Ly9tb2JpbGUucmV1dGVycy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9hbXAvaWRVU1RSRTY5UjFTWjIwMTAxMDI4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png,2010-10-28,"{'sent': 'NARORA, India (', 'ents': {'ORG': ['NARORA'], 'GPE': ['India']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"The African elephant is actually two different species, according to a new DNA study that may settle a long-simmering debate.

""The big surprise of this paper,"" though, is just how genetically different the African savanna elephant and the African forest elephant are, co-author David Reich said.

(See African forest elephant pictures from National Geographic magazine.)

According to the new research, the two major types of African elephants are about as genetically distinct from each other as the Asian elephant is from the extinct woolly mammoth.

And that difference has deep roots in the elephant family tree, the DNA evidence suggests.

The two apparent African elephant species appear to have evolved from a common ancestor between two and a half million and five million years ago—nearly as long ago as the human and chimpanzee lineages diverged, according to some genetic studies.

For Species Designation, Size Doesn't Matter

Traditionally, the forest and savanna elephants have been classified as subspecies of the same species. But numerous distinctions have been noted. For example, forest elephants live in family groups of just a few animals, whereas savanna elephant family groups number about ten and often congregate in groups of 70 or so.

And—perhaps unsurprisingly, given its wide-open habitat—the African savanna elephant (Loxodonta africana) has evolved to be about twice as big as the forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis).

The savanna elephant tips the scales at up to seven tons and stands a full meter (3.3 feet) taller at the shoulder than the African forest elephant, which lives in equatorial forests of central and western Africa.

But even plainly visible morphological, or physical, differences don't necessarily indicate that animals are of separate species.

""Animals have an amazing capacity to change in morphology over short periods of time,"" said Reich, a population geneticist at Harvard Medical School.

Without pressures from predators and competitors, for example, species isolated on islands can shrink in just tens of thousands of years—a blink of the eye in evolutionary time.

Elephants have experienced such transitions before, producing animals like the ""pygmy"" Asian elephant of Borneo, which isn't considered a separate species, despite its relatively short, round shape.

Interspecies Elephant Sex?

Debate over the species status of African elephants has been simmering for at least a decade.

A 2001 study in the journal Science included the first DNA evidence that the savanna and forest elephants are separate species.

But then other studies showed that at least a small number of savanna elephants shared mitochondrial DNA—genetic information passed down from only mothers—with forest elephants.

This ""proved there was some interbreeding within at least the past 500,000 years,"" Reich explained.

But that limited interbreeding isn't evidence that the two elephant types are from the same species, he said. It's just an example of interspecies hybridization, relatively common in the animal world, ha added.

Mammoth DNA Called Into Play

The key to the new discovery was some ""cold case"" genetics work on ancient, extinct elephant relatives: the woolly mammoth and the mastodon. The mastodon's nuclear genome, in particular, was sequenced for the first time for the study.

The genomes of five distinct animals—the Asian elephant, African savanna elephant, African forest elephant, woolly mammoth, and American mastodon—were then compared and contrasted.

The results showed that ""in fact these [African elephant] populations diverged long ago and are at least as different as Asian elephants and mammoths—and those two are not only different species but entirely different genera,"" Reich said.

The apparent new species discovery is more than just cocktail party fodder for geneticists—it may have important conservation and management implications.

If Africa's elephants are from two distinct species, then each has a smaller population than previously believed. In this case, forest elephants may be of particular concern, because far less is known about their population status. Their numbers may prove small enough to garner additional protections.",African Elephants Really Two Wildly Different Species?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDEwLzEyLzEwMTIyMi1hZnJpY2FuLWVsZXBoYW50cy10d28tc3BlY2llcy1uZXctc2NpZW5jZS_SAXhodHRwczovL2FwaS5uYXRpb25hbGdlb2dyYXBoaWMuY29tL2Rpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi9wdWJsaWMvYW1wL25ld3MvMjAxMC8xMi8xMDEyMjItYWZyaWNhbi1lbGVwaGFudHMtdHdvLXNwZWNpZXMtbmV3LXNjaWVuY2U?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/306/30651.ngsversion.1421960098780.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2010-12-22,"{'sent': 'The African elephant is actually two different species, according to a new DNA study that may settle a long-simmering debate.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}",Elephant

Gharials pose no threat to people: those slimline jaws are not up to biting chunks off you. But they're adept at grabbing fish underwater, using a quick sideways swipe and snap. And the 100 or so needle-like teeth ensure that no catch slips back out. This is a big beast, sometimes topping six metres.

“Being conducted from Guddu to Sukkur, the survey would conclude on April 21 of this year,” said a senior official in the Wildlife department.

The survey team comprises 35 officials of the Sindh Wildlife Department and WWF–Pakistan.

The blind Indus dolphin survey was expected to take place in February but was delayed.

“Actually, the survey was scheduled to kick off from February 4. But, it was postponed on account of security reasons,” said Ghulam Mohammad Guddani, assistant conservator of the wildlife department.

According to the survey conducted by WWF-P in 2006, there are only 1,600 dolphins in 190-km Indus Dolphin Reserve, some 900 of them found in the area from the Guddu Barrage to Kotri Barrage.

There are reports that a number of blind dolphins have slipped into canals and other water channels from the River Indus following gushing floodwater.

“However, there becomes need to conduct survey and census of the blind Indus dolphin to assess their actual status,” said a senior wildlife official.

Coordinator of Indus River Dolphin Conservation Project of WWF-P, Uzma Naureen Khan, said that the falling water level in the River Indus, harmful fishing practices, use of poisonous chemicals by fishermen and construction of hydel power stations along the Indus are among others, serious threats to the survival of the unique species.

“Use of the poisonous chemicals by the greedy fishermen is too perilous, particularly when there is insufficient water in the river,” she remarked.

Naureen said that the recent death of seven blind Indus dolphins under mysterious conditions plunged the wildlife conservationists into shock.

Geographically, they are found only in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The South Asian river dolphin is categorised into two sub-species: the Ganges River dolphin (binomial name platanista gangetics genetic) and the Indus River dolphin (plantanista gangetics minor).

The Ganges River dolphin is primarily found in the Ganges and Brahamputra River in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The Indus River dolphin, which is locally known as Bhulan, is found in Sindh, Pakistan.

The blind Indus dolphin is the rarest species on the earth.This mammal is unique because of its features. The body of the blinddolphin is as smooth as silk, hairless, and pinkish grey. The skin is devoid of mucous secretions and so fragile that is can be easily cut with a slight touch. Its length is between 1.5 and 2.5 metres and carries a maximum weight of 90kg.

It does not have crystal eye lens and for this reason it is blind.

Navigation and hunting under water is entirely different by ecolocation or ecosystem. These characteristics make the blind dolphin distinctive from other dolphins.

In Pakistan the blind dolphin is found between Guddu and Sukkur. In 2001 the International Union for Conservation of Nature declared Indus dolphin as the most 'threatened species' Later, a joint survey conduct in 2006 by World Wide Fund,Pakistan, and the Sindh Wildlife Department counted only 810 dolphins. That survey covered the area of mere 200km from Guddu to Sukkur and water samples were obtained after 10km.

From April 2006 to March 2011 some 45 royal blind dolphins were reported dead. Conservation experts identified these were caused by the use of toxic fishing net, poisonous chemicals used by fishermen, release of hot poisonous water of the Guddu thermal, industrial wastewater and drainage water into the river at Sukkur and construction of hydel-power stations.

The Sindh government must declare a 200km 'confined area' and strictly implement the law against use of poisonous chemicals and nets by greedy fishermen. Industrialists alsoshould be issued warning letters not to let poisonous wastewater in the river.

I personally never saw any of Dolphin Centre, Sukkur, officials stopping a fisherman. Deputy Conservator Ghulam Mohammad Gaddani was reported by Dawn (Jan 8) as having said that that 31 royal blind dolphins died just in a period of five months.

Previous five years' survey from April 2006 to March 2011 puts the total death at 45. This rapid increase in deaths of blind dolphins shows the negligence and failure of the Sindh government, the wildlife department and Dolphin Centre, Sukkur.Severalrequests have been made by the deputy conservator to the authorities concerned for collective efforts but all in vain.On the other hand, the Indian government has declared the Ganges dolphin as National Aquatic Animal. I request the chief minister of Sindh to take action and pass an order to the departments concerned for the preservation of blind Indus dolphin.

Fillet of dolphin? Polar bear steak? As world population increases, people in coastal poverty-stricken areas are turning to the ocean for their meals, consuming marine mammals such as dolphins and seals, new research suggests.

Since 1990, at least 87 species of marine mammals — including dolphins, porpoises and manatees — have been served up in 114 countries. They are the victims of hunting and even commercial fishing operations, where they are sometimes caught accidentally, the researchers said.

The fishing of larger marine mammals, like humpback whales, is strictly regulated and monitored; but the extent to which these smaller warm-blooded marine species, including dolphins and seals, are caught, killed and eaten has been largely unstudied and unmonitored.

""International regulatory bodies exist to gauge the status of whale populations and regulate the hunting of these giants,"" study researcher Martin Robards, of the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in a statement. ""These species, however, represent only a fraction of the world's diversity of marine mammals, many of which are being accidentally netted, trapped, and — in some instances — directly hunted without any means of tracking as to whether these off-takes are sustainable.""

This Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is one of many marine mammals threatened by human consumption, according to a recent study from the Wildlife Conservation Society and Okapi Wildlife Associates. People in at least 114 countries since 1990 have consumed one or more of at least 87 marine mammal species. (Image credit: Graeme Hornby.)

To get a clearer picture of the problem, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Okapi Wildlife Associates examined records on small fisheries focused on small whales (like pilot whales), dolphins and porpoises from 1975 and records of global marine mammal catches between 1966 and 1975.

From there, the researchers consulted about 900 other sources, including reports and discussions with numerous researchers and environmental managers; the exhaustive investigation took three years to complete.

They found that since 1990, people in at least 114 countries have consumed one or more of at least 87 marine mammal species.The list includes species people might not know by name or sight, such as the pygmy beaked whale, South Asian river dolphin, narwhal, Chilean dolphin, long-finned pilot whale and Burmeister's porpoise. The list also includes well-known species, such as bottlenose dolphins, seals, sea lions (including the California sea lion), polar bears and three species of manatees. [Gallery: Polar Bears Swimming in the Arctic]

Some of these species, like the manatee's close relative the dugong, are considered a delicacy in some parts of the world, making them targets of human consumption.

Since the 1970s, humans' taste for these warm-blooded aquatic animals has apparently been on the rise, the researchers found, especially incoastal areas and estuaries (where rivers meet oceans). This could be due, in part, to changes in fishing techniques in those areas, where these marine mammals are caught as ""bycatch"" in nets meant for other fish.

In areas such as the Congo, Gabon and Madagascar, these marine mammals serve as supplementary sources of dietary protein, similar to the animals in the forests that are taken by hunters and locals as bushmeat. As the world's population continues to increase, so does its food needs. The Wildlife Conservation Society is working with fishermen in these areas to reduce the need to catch wild marine mammals, and instead hunt sustainable fish.

The researchers say that increased awareness of the problem and increased monitoring are needed to prevent the destruction of marine life.

""There is a need for improved monitoring of species such as Atlantic and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins,"" Howard Rosenbaum, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society's Ocean Giants Program, said in a statement. ""In more remote areas and a number of countries, a greater immediate need is to understand the motivations behind the consumption of marine mammals and use these insights to develop solutions to protect these iconic species.""

The study was published Jan. 24 in the journal Biological Conservation.

Nijhum Dweep is the national coastal biodiversity hotspot especially for the migratory birds in Bangladesh. The cluster of islets just off the central coast in Bay of Bengal is the crossroads of two global migratory flyways: the East-Asia-Australasia and the Central Asia. This has been recognised by Birdlife International and Wetlands International.

During the eighties, we, a group of wildlife biologists had led several expeditions and identified the ecological significance of the central coast in the Bay. We organised sky survey all along the coast using Sesna aircraft to identify the important spot for migratory birds and their resting, feeding and roosting sites. Dr. Derek Scot from International Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Bureau (IWRB), UK; Mr. Mark Barter, Australasia Wader Studies Group, Australia; Mr. Abdul Wahab Akonda, of Forest Department, Dr. SMA Rashid of NACOM; Dr. John Howes, Mr. David Bakewell and Ms. Susan Wang of AWB joined us in the team. The study was carried under the project titled III Forestry of Forest Department and supported by the World Bank.

After the Arial survey, we did the ground 'truthing' covering the coastline from Sonadia to Kuakata. Later, we have conducted another detail study for the Forestry Resource Management Project (FRMP) of Forest Department/ BCAS, supported by Asian Development Bank. The major recommendations of both the studies were to declare Nijhum dweep as RAMSAR site, Shorebird Reserve and establish Coastal Biodiversity Research Center there.

The study also identified other islands in the central coast which act as the important stepping stones and staging grounds of nearly 50 species of waterbirds. The distribution, abundance and their ecological significance were also assessed. The sites which have global significance are: Urir Char- Hatiya Coast; Monpura- Kukrimukri Coast; Char Montaj- Kuakata Coast and Sundarban's Coast. All these sites were proposed as seasonal shorebird reserves.

As the National Coordinator of Asian Waterfowl Census (AWC) I had reported the occurrence of globally threatened waterbirds such as Spoon-billed Sandpiper, Asian Dowitcher, Nordman's Greenshank, Spotted Redshank, Goliath Heron and Indian Skimmers in good numbers in the Nijhum Dweep and had raised the international biodiversity significance of Nijhum Dweep at global forum by presenting our findings in several global biodiversity conferences held in Malaysia, Australia, UK, Germany, France and USA during the early eighties.

Birds migrate to this Bay fall under three different categories viz. early migrants, passage migrants and winter migrants. Early migrants use to come to our coast during October- November -- those who either stay here for a while and migrates further south or some of them stay throughout winter. The passage migrants visit our coast in large numbers and stay for a few days for 're-fueling' and move to their winter destination. And finally the winter migrants come to our coast and use the coastal mudflats as their feeding ground and roam there entire winter season.

Nijhum Dweep down off Hatiya island in the bay is a cluster of islets having enormous coastal biomass productivity. At its centre the raised land is the old growth of planted mangroves forest. The man-made mangrove re-colonised various wildlife including, jackal, otter, mongoose, rats, fishing cats, bats, monitor lizards, snakes and birds. Forest department has introduced the spotted deer, rhesus macaque and python from the Sundarbans mangrove forest.

The channels around Nijhum Dweep are very much rich in macro-benthos and other invertebrates. Among them crustaceans, nematodes and helminthes are dominant. Intertidal creeks are full of different types of algae which are used by the ducks in large quantities. The clusters of islets and its surroundings comprise various types of habitats. Important among them are: network of intertidal creeks inside mangroves, massive mudflats, grassland, reed land, sand flats, sand beaches, sand dunes and dipper channels. Nijhum Dweep is rich in fish fauna specially crustaceans and other estuarine fish populations. We have recorded existence of the globally threatened turtles, the Batagur, and Green turtles from the beach of Nijhum Dweep. The channels around Nijhum dweep are good abode of Ganges Dolphin, Indo-Pacific Humpback, Finless Porpoise and Irrawaddy Dolphin. Several kilometers of intertidal sand flats at the south of Nijhum Dweep is the most important staging ground of 10,000 to 20,000 migratory birds.

Based on our Asian Waterfowl Census, we have discovered various species of waterbirds, their flight path and habitat preference in Bangladesh. Nijhum dweep and its adjacent areas support a large number of migratory waterbirds which range from 30,000 to 50,000 in number belonging to 95 species. Average arrivals and main species compositions are: Gulls and Terns 10,000-20,000; Ducks and Geese 7,000-10,000; Egrets and Herons 5,000-7,000; Indian Skimmer 2000-3000; Black-headed Ibis 500-1,000; Black-tailed Godwit 3,000-5,000; Pied Avocet 100-200; Greater Sand plover 1,000-2,000; Lesser Sand plover 3,000-5,000; Kentish Plover; 500-1,000; Little Stint 1,000-2,000; Curlew Sandpiper 500-1,000; Asian Dowitcher 30-50; Nordman's Greenshank 10-20; Spotted Red Shank; 5-15; Spoon-billed Sandpiper 20-300; Goliath Heron 1-4; Redshank 2,000-3,000 and Greenshank 1,000-1,500.

Char Bahauddin close to Nijhum Dweep is the safe haven for breeding birds like Indian River tern, Common tern and Great Thick Knee.

Threats to migratory waterbirds and their habitats include:

* Loss of habitat through reclamation of wetlands

* Loss of habitat due to intensifying agriculture

* Degradation of habitat through pollution

* Reduction or diversion of water supply

* Increase in disturbance by humans

* Invasive plants and predators

* Climate change

Change in land-use planning and land grabbing are two major threats to the biota of Nijhum Dweep. Mangrove plantation in and around the islets has been reducing the mudflats. Overfishing in the channel and buffalo grazing in the mudflats are also posing threat to the habitat of migratory birds in the region.

Waterbirds are a diverse group of wetland dependent bird species. They are extremely important both from a conservation and recreational point of view. Most of these species have adapted to the drastically changing conditions of wetlands through their migratory behaviour.

Many waterbirds complete annual migrations flying several thousand kilometers between their breeding and non-breeding areas, passing many national borders and even that between continents. These migration routes are called flyways. Waterbird conservation and sustainable management requires coordinated actions throughout the length of a flyway.

A flyway is the entire range through which a migratory bird species (or groups of related species or distinct populations of a single species) move on an annual basis from the breeding grounds to non-breeding areas, including intermediate resting and feeding places.

The East Asia-Australasian Flyway (the Flyway) is one of the nine major migratory waterbird flyways around the globe. It extends from within the Arctic Circle in Russia and Alaska, southwards through East and South-east Asia, to Australia and New Zealand in the south, encompassing 22 countries. Migratory waterbirds share this flyway with 45% of the world's human population.

The Central Asian Flyways (CAF) covers large continental area of Eurasia between the Arctic Ocean and its associated islands. CAF comprises several important migration routes of water birds, most of which extend from the northernmost breeding grounds in Siberia to the southernmost non-breeding wintering grounds in west Asia, South Asia, the Maldives and Indian Ocean islands.

The Flyway is home to over 50 million migratory waterbirds -- including shorebirds, Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans) and cranes from over 250 different populations, including 28 globally threatened species. There are currently 700 sites recognised as internationally important to migratory waterbirds along the flyway, many of which are located adjacent to human settlement and vulnerable to rapid social and economic development pressures. Without international cooperation to address these threats, many waterbird species will face extinction in the near future.

Bangladesh needs to join the Convention on Migratory Species (Bonn Convention) and implement the Global Migratory Birds Conservation Strategy and Action Programmes to save the flying wonders of the world. Nijhum Dweep could be a bright star of Bay of Bengal Biodiversity if proper conservation measures are taken through establishing a shorebird reserve.

Rare and threatened species of dolphins got some good news with the opening of three new wildlife sanctuaries in Bangladesh, the Wildlife Conservation Society announced today (Feb. 14).

Bangladesh's government declared the areas to be wildlife sanctuaries Jan. 29, establishing them in part to protect freshwater dolphins in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove ecosystem.

The sanctuaries will serve the last two species of freshwater dolphins in Asia: the Ganges River dolphin and the Irrawaddy dolphin.

Although there is no global population estimate for either species, both have disappeared from major portions of their range. Yet both species occur in sufficient numbers in the Sundarbans, which may serve as a global safety net for preventing their extinction. Freshwater dolphins are among the most threatened wildlife on Earth because their habitat is highly degraded by human activities, including dam construction and unsustainable fisheries.

The three sanctuaries safeguard 19 miles (31 kilometers) of channels that were found by a 2010 Wildlife Conservation Society study to be important habitat for the dolphins and were threatened by human activity.

""Declaration of these wildlife sanctuaries is an essential first step in protecting Ganges River and Irrawaddy dolphins in Bangladesh,"" said Brian Smith, director of the WCS' Asian Freshwater and Coastal Cetacean Program.

The sanctuaries will be a natural laboratory for learning how to balance wildlife conservation with a large and growing human population, said Tapan Kumar Dey of the Bangladesh forest department.

The dolphins are threatened by fishing gear, depletion of their prey and increasing salinity and sedimentation caused by sea-level rise.

News of the declared sanctuaries follows the extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin, last detected in a confirmed sighting in 2002. Entanglement in nets and habitat degradation killed off a species that had existed in the Yangtze River of China for 10 million years.

In addition to conserving globally important populations of freshwater dolphins, the new wildlife sanctuaries in the Sundarbans are expected to provide protection for other threatened aquatic wildlife including the river terrapin, masked finfoot, and small-clawed otter.

0,"On Valentine’s Day, the Ministry of Environment and Forests uploaded on its website the wildlife clearance accorded to 1750 MW Lower Demwe Hydroelectric Project across the River Lohit in Arunachal Pradesh. Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee wanted it cleared and so did Nabam Tuki, the Chief Minister of Arunachal Pradesh. For weeks press reports suggested Jayanthi Natarajan would bow to these powerful entities.

Of the three approvals needed, the dam project has already received the environmental one, while the Forest Advisory Committee is deliberating on the forest clearance. The majority of the Standing Committee of the National Board of Wildlife (SC-NBWL) strongly recommended against giving the project wildlife clearance, and Natarajan has disregarded its objections.

Lower Demwe is to be located where the Lohit plummets from the hills to the plains, near a site called Parasuram Kund. Such geographical transitional zones are critical ecological locations. Perhaps this is the reason the location is sacred to the Hindus and various indigenous tribes of the state such as Mishmi, Deori and Khampti.

Asad Rahmani of the Bombay Natural History Society was asked by the SC-NBWL to evaluate the project’s impact on wildlife reserves in Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. Read an account of his report in Down to Earth. Rahmani reported the dramatic repercussions likely to affect the ecology of river islands, Dibru-Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, the foraging grounds of the Asian buffalo and hog deer, and the Bengal florican. Most critically, the dam will act as a bulwark against any attempt by fish like, golden mahseer, to migrate upriver.

Pratap Singh, Chief Conservator of Forests (Wildlife), Arunachal Pradesh Forest Department, was the other member tasked with assessing the dam’s effects on wildlife. He argued since much of the impact is unknown, studies should be conducted in tandem with the project. If these studies report an unacceptable impact on severely endangered species, say, five years from now, would the state ensure the company complies with any recommended least-damage practices?

Jagdish Krishnaswamy, a hydrologist at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment, says capturing water in the reservoir for several hours a day will leave the water level so low that the river “will become inhospitable” for the Ganges dolphin, a critically endangered species.

It’s not only the wildlife fraternity that opposes the project, the people of Assam downstream of the dam, who fear their livelihoods will be severely affected, are against it as well. But the authorities want this project so badly that they’re not playing by the rules. The proposal to the SC-NBWL states that the Lower Demwe project is not sub judice, when it most certainly is. An appeal challenging the environmental clearance was filed at the National Environmental Appellate Authority, now transferred to the National Green Tribunal, where the case is being heard.

Additional misinformation includes the estimated distance of the reservoir from Kamlang Wildlife Sanctuary. The application to the SC-NBWL said 0.5 kilometres, while its submission to the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) said 50 metres. To the SC-NBWL, it mentioned 43,000 trees will be cleared, but to the FAC, 1,24,000 trees. A 26 per cent stake in the power project makes the State Government a project promoter, not an impartial administrator of the state.

The Arunachal Forest Department claims the people of the state are frustrated by the delay caused to this project. It appears to have ignored the August 2010 appeal by an indigenous group, Arunachal Citizens Rights, to save its people and their livelihoods from mega-dams. At the same time, the Arunachal State Government has no qualms about blithely recommending the displacement of people, not only from two villages in Dibru-Saikhowa in Assam, but from river islands within its own state.

In February 2011, the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti, an activist group fighting for farmers’ rights, wrote to Jairam Ramesh, the former Minister of Environment and Forests, accusing Athena Demwe Power Ltd., the company building the dam, of violating the Forest Conservation Act. The Ministry forwarded the complaint to the Arunachal State Forest Department for enquiry. The state appears to have merely asked the company for clarifications and the resulting verdict: there were no violations. In December 2011, the group wrote again to Natarajan with evidence; it enclosed photographs of the company constructing roads on forest land for which approval had not been obtained.

As Tseten Lepcha, the Honorary Wildlife Warden of North Sikkim, pointed out in a letter to Ramesh in April 2011, the same company has already been accused of violating the Wildlife Protection Act (it killed a serow, a goat-like antelope that enjoys the highest protection) in Sikkim. Besides, the dam promoters ignored the law and did not apply for wildlife clearance for three years after starting the Sikkim project. Although it is now two years since they finally did, it hasn’t even figured in the agenda of the SC-NBWL although the dam is more than 60 per cent complete. Instead the Ministry has given the wildlife clearance to a later project, the Lower Demwe dam.

In a blatant case of conflict of interest, the Ministry allowed P. Abraham, who served on the Board of Directors of several power companies as well as PTC Ltd., one of the promoters of Athena Demwe, to chair the Expert Appraisal Committee when the environmental clearance of Lower Demwe was being considered. A Ministry-commissioned Lohit Basin study was to assess the cumulative impact of all the dams coming up on that river and its tributaries. Abraham’s Committee dissociated the results of this study from affecting the environmental clearance process of Upper and Lower Demwe dams. After six organizations filed a complaint, Abraham resigned from the Committee. Instead of placing all the projects he approved under review, the Ministry has allowed the damage he wrought to fester.

Arunachal Pradesh claims Lower Demwe is crucial for its development. It is one of 147 dams (as of July 2011 and more are on the way) to be built across the state. These identified projects will produce more than 57,000 MW of power. The 1750 MW Lower Demwe will produce less than three percent of that total.

There is now another bogey, China, being used to ram this project through the approval process. India and China do not have a treaty on water sharing and, therefore, India wants to build dams quickly across the Siang, the Dibang and the Lohit rivers to claim “first user rights.” A similar argument was used in April 2010 to appeal for the construction of the 2700 MW Lower Siang Hydroelectric project. Lower Demwe is one of seven dams scheduled to come up on the main Lohit river and compared to the rest, its ecological impact is the greatest. If India wants to pip China in asserting first rights, any one of the other six dams will do the job.

However, is damming a river the only way to use it? Don’t centuries of irrigating, navigating, fishing and drinking its waters count as “use”? As far as can be ascertained, the principle of “first user rights” has its roots in the American Wild West. This could arguably be the Wild East, but both Tibet and Arunachal have been settled for centuries. Besides, China claims all of Arunachal Pradesh as its territory. Would it respect any Indian assertion of “first user rights”?

Instead of acting like cowboys in a lawless world, India ought to talk to China and negotiate a treaty. This is an action favoured by the people and government of Assam as well as groups such as Arunachal Citizens Rights and South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People. But China is only a feint, there is much more at stake.

The Arunachal State Government has received an upfront premium of Rs. 93 crores in the year 2007-2008 for Upper and Lower Demwe, long before the projects received any clearances. In the meantime, Pranab Mukherjee wanted Lower Demwe cleared to safeguard financial investments. A system where companies have to borrow enormous sums of money from banks to pay the state, before the project is even cleared, brings tremendous pressure to bear on the Ministry of Environment and Forests to give its seal of approval. Abdicating their primary role of exercising due diligence on behalf of our forests, wildlife and people (see the Supreme Court judgment on the government’s constitutional duty), the State and Central Governments act as minions of banks and private companies.

It’s not enough to just declare the Ganges dolphin as India’s national aquatic animal, the Ministry and the Centre need to put their efforts where their mouths are. By approving this ecologically disastrous project, the State and the Centre have made a mockery of rule of law while drowning India’s avowed commitment to protect its wildlife with this misbegotten dam.

LAHORE: Experts on Wednesday recommended revising fishing regulations, more research and cooperation among government departments and NGOs to conserve the Indus River Dolphin (bhullan).

The proposals came at the end of the two-day Indus River Dolphin Conservation Strategy and Action Plan 2012- 2022, organised by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Wildlife Departments of three provinces.

According to a WWF-Pakistan Survey in July 2011, about 1,600 to 1,750 dolphins live along the 1,500-km stretch of River Indus. Of these 1,293 dolphins are found in the 200-km stretch between Guddu and Sukkur Barrages.

It is the second most endangered freshwater dolphin species in the world. The blind dolphins use echolocation, a sonar-like mechanism in which they utter a sound and then use the returning echoes to locate the position of the object generating the echoes.

Four groups comprising local and international conservationists and representatives of Irrigation and Wildlife Departments gave various suggestions about how to best preserve the dolphins. The recommendations were a follow up to lectures about the dolphins and existing laws on the first day of the workshop.

Ghulam Sarwar Gachal, head of zoology at the University of Sindh, stressed the need for research on fish resources and changing water levels in River Indus. It was also proposed that universities should lead with research while WWF, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the Pakistan Science Foundation should help with funds.

Other proposals included documenting the dolphins’ demographics and working with the Chinese Academy of Science, which is conducting research about the behaviour of river dolphins. Shadmeena Khanum, Himalayan Wildlife Foundation manager, said that Pakistan could either send samples to China or have their researchers come to Pakistan for research. She also suggested collaboration with institutes in India and Bangladesh.

Khanum also suggested that the WWF start an ‘eco-tourism package’ to educate people about the dolphins. “A percentage of the money generated can go towards conservation projects,” she said. She also recommended setting up a web portal to raise awareness and seek funds from around the world to conserve the dolphin.

Ghulam Muhammad Mehar, Sindh Fisheries Department director general, said that “overfishing, particularly fishing during night hours” needed to be checked to conserve Indus dolphins.

“Fishermen lay nets at night. Dolphins usually swim along with fish and thus get trapped in the nets. Some die as a result,” he said. He said that Fisheries and Wildlife departments need to work together to revise fishing regulations in order to make them more ‘dolphin friendly’. “Since licensing was introduced 18 months ago, more dolphins have died,” he said. Mehar said that local communities needed to be engaged in conservation efforts, “They sometimes hunt the dolphin for medicinal purposes,” he said, “Conservationists need to understand such issues.”

Dr Peter Thomas, the International and Policy Programme director of the Marine Mammal Commission, said that illegal fishing practices needed to be checked and penalties imposed on people who harmed or killed a dolphin.

0,"Sometime back, when Union Minister Jairam Ramesh visited Bihar and wanted to see dolphins in the Ganga, he, in a lighter vein, asked, “Where is our Dolphin Man?” The minister was referring to Dr Ravindra Kumar Sinha, Professor at Patna University’s Zoology Department.



Dr Sinha accompanied him to the confluence of Ganga and Gandak where they saw families of Ganges dolphin. Through his tireless effort, dolphin was given the status of National Aquatic Animal by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on October 5, 2009. A pioneer researcher and conservationist for this cetacean species, Sinha has spent the better part of his life sailing in rivers.



He was appointed an expert member of the National Ganga River Basin Authority. “It was a great honour, as Chief Ministers of those states through which Ganga flows, are its members,” said Dr Sinha, in a free-wheeling interview to Abhay Kumar of Deccan Herald.





Excerpts:



You have been doing research on dolphins for the last three decades. How and when did you get fascinated with this aquatic animal?





In the 60s, when I was in school, I came to Patna for the first time as my grandmother was to be cremated at Baans Ghat on the banks of Ganga. It was then I saw pods of dolphins, more than two-metre long, coming to water surface every 15-20 seconds. Since then, dolphin has become an integral part of my life.



How you were nick-named ‘Dolphin Man’?



I have spent more than half of my life doing research on Ganga ecosystem, river and wetland ecology, Ganges river dolphin, aquatic wildlife etc but it was Planning Commission member Dr Syed Z Qasim, who, while introducing me to Dr Stephen Leatherwood of International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1992, was the first one to have said, “Meet our Dolphin Man-- Dr RK Sinha”.



What is the exact figure of dolphins in India?



To be very honest, exact census of dolphin is not possible. We can only have sighting records. As per the latest figures, there are 2,587 dolphins in India. However, India, Bangladesh and Nepal together account for 3,061 dolphins.



But it is believed that the stretch of Ganga from Buxar to Katihar (in Bihar) has substantial dolphins?



Yes, it’s true. From Buxar to Maniharighat (Katihar), 808 dolphins have been sighted in the Ganga, while in Kosi it’s just 85. However, in Gandak, the figure is as high as 267. Altogether, there are 1,160 dolphins in Bihar. Jairam Ramesh saw many dolphins at the confluence of Ganga and Gandak.



But even Chilka lake in Odisha is famous for dolphins…?



It’s mostly Irrawaddy dolphin (Irrawady is a river in Myanmar). And it’s scientific name is Orcaella Brevirostris.



But Ganga river dolphins are one of the four surviving fresh water dolphins?



Yes, the Ganges river dolphin is a fresh water dolphin which never enters sea. It is found in Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna, and Sangu-Karnaphuli river systems in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Besides Ganges river dolphin, the other two fresh water dolphins are Indus river dolphin (scientific name: Platanista gangetica minor), commonly known as Bhulan in Pakistan; and Amazon river dolphin (scientific name: Inia geoffrensis), which is commonly known as Boto in Latin America.



And the fourth one?



It’s Yangtze river dolphin (scientific name: Lipotes vexillifer), which is fondly called Baiji in China. Unfortunately, it became extinct in 2006.



The scientific name of Indus river dolphin sounds similar to Ganges river dolphin.

Yes, around 3,000 years back, their origin was the same. Both Ganges and Indus river dolphins are blind as they lack crystalline lens in their eyes, though they have remnants of retina in their vestigial eye. They cannot form image. However, they distinguish between light and dark.



Any other interesting facts?



Adult males grow up to 2.12 metres long and females up to 2.7 metres. A calf measures 70 cm and weighs about 4 kg at the time of birth. An adult female weighs up to 150 kg.



Is dolphin a slow breeder?



Yes. Female dolphin attains sexual maturity at 10 years, while male at about eight years of age. Gestation period is 9 to 10 months. One baby is born at a time. Next baby is born after 2-3 years.



What are the major threats to this aquatic animal?



The two main threats are poaching and habitat degradation. Earlier, dolphins were killed intentionally by the fishermen using fishing nets, harpoons etc. The harpooning has, however, now stopped but unintentional killings in fishing nets are still continuing. The fishermen use dolphin oil as fish attractant and massage to get relieved from joint pains. The habitat degradation is mainly due to reduced flow in rivers, pollution and construction of dams/barrages.



It is believed that the number of dolphins is an indicator of how clean or dirty the river ecology is?



Yes, it’s an indicator of health of rivers. In fact, the Ganges river dolphin is a legendary creature which has been mentioned in many of our mythological literature. You will be surprised to know that it was given legal protection by Emperor Ashoka in 3rd century BC by including this aquatic animal in a government decree in the Vth Pillar Edict. The Government gave it a legal protection by including it in the Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, while Dr Manmohan Singh declared this species as National Aquatic Animal on October 5, 2009.



How its killing can be stopped?



Fishermen will have to be educated that they can use alternate oil which can be extracted from the fish scraps. Besides, we have told the government that it should assist fishermen through micro-financing and help them involve in eco-tourism, fish culture etc as an alternate source of livelihood.



Having done so much of research, any regrets in life?

Wildlife adventure is not only a great choice for a holiday with kids, it is also one of the best ways to connect with nature. Imagine waking up to the bird calls and not the alarm clock on your desk; not wanting to snooze any longer and heading out in the greens. Singing with the winds and walking by the riverside to spot animals drinking water. The feeling is extraordinary and absolutely high on the wish list for nature lovers.



Thanks to our varied geographical terrains, India is home to scores of species of mammals, rare birds, reptiles, insects and amphibians. Add to it, the diverse flora that supports our ecosystem. However, many species of birds and animals are now on the verge of becoming extinct because of climate and geographic changes and also by excessive hunting by man (for food, medicine and recreational reasons). According to ecologists, more than 600 species of animals and birds are expected to be extinct if not protected by wildlife management.

MISSION: TIGER TRAIL







HEAD TO: BANDHAVGARH, KANHA, JIM CORBETT, RANTHAMBORE



Spotting the national animal of India — the Tiger, can be a fabulous experience. You can take your family on a tiger trail to Bandhavgarh, which is over 200 kms north-east of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh. The nearest village is Tala, which is the access point of the park. In MP itself, Kanha National Park has the pride of providing the setting for Rudyard Kipling’s classic novel, The Jungle Book.



This large park is well regarded for its research and conservation programme. If you prefer a drive from Delhi, then head to Ranthambore National Park. Take your kids to India’s first national park — Corbett, which was established in 1936 by legendary tiger hunter Jim Corbett. Located in Uttarakhand, around three hours from Nainital and seven hours from Delhi.







STAY OPTIONS: King’s Lodge, Tiger’s Den Resort, Mahua Kothi Resort and Treehouse Hideaway and Syna Tiger Resort at Bandhavgarh. At Kanha, stay over at Baghira Log Huts, Wild Chalet Resort, Pugmark Resort, Kanha Jungle Lodge and Mumba Resort. At Corbett, stay over at Tiger Camp, Corbett River View Retreat, Ramganga Resort, Ashoka’s Tiger Trail and Camp Forktail Creek Jungle Lodge.



Ladakh , known as ‘The Broken Moon’ is set in a spectacular environment enclosed by the mighty ranges of Karakoram and the Himalayas and is one of the most desirable destinations for travellers. Being a professional tourist host and artist, Ghulam Mustafa and his brother Ghulam Mohiuddin desired to provide to travellers coming here a balance between adventure and comfort through their Hotel The Grand Dragon Ladakh.

0,"Welcome to the jungle: it's a very Indian entity. The word derives from Sanskrit jangala, meaning uncultivated ground or scrubland, and was adopted by British traders in the mid-18th century. Thereafter it also acquired associations with steamy forest and wild beasts. India contains all the above natural elements in abundance, of course. It isn't only home to a good 17 per cent of the world's humanity – a great gamut of creatures inhabits its diverse jungle lands. Indeed, from the high slopes of the Himalayas to the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, the swamps of the Sunderbans in Bengal and the forests of the Western Ghats, this vast country supports a kaleidoscope of biodiversity.

There are 97 national parks and a good 440 wildlife sanctuaries. Some, such as Periyar National Park in Kerala, are easily accessible to tourists; others including Mouling National Park in the north eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, are challengingly remote. In many, elegant, black-faced langurs and thuggish rhesus macaque monkeys are ubiquitous; spotted deer (or chital), too. All of them are meals for a variety of predators. Meantime, even those who have never felt moved to pick up a pair of binoculars at home are inevitably entranced by India's bird-life, from eagles and hornbills to kingfishers, paradise flycatchers and scarlet minivets – the poetry of whose name is matched by the dazzling plumage of the males.

Across the country the Zoological Survey of India (zsi.gov.in) has recorded 92,037 species of fauna – a figure that includes four species of spider and 22 of frogs that were discovered only last year. It also includes 57 critically endangered animal species, ranging from the psychedelic-blue gooty tarantula to the pygmy hog being bred in captivity in Assam. The list of endangered animals in India runs from Asiatic bear, primarily inhabiting Himalayan regions, and Asiatic lion, now surviving only in Gujarat (see ""Lion's share"") to leopard (common, snow and clouded species) and wild buffalo – mostly found in Assam and with a recovery programme under way in Udanti sanctuary in the central state of Chhattisgarh. And then, of course, there's the tiger. On the last official count (in 2010), there were 1,706 Bengal tigers left in India.

As the release of Ang Lee's film version of Yann Martel's Life of Pi shows, our fascination with tigers is undimmed – and it would be impossible to overstate the tiger's importance to India's tourist industry. Yet this summer, tiger tourism was effectively banned in India. That was thanks to a ruling the Supreme Court made in response to a petition filed last year by an environmental campaigner. After much lobbying by the tourist industry and conservationists, the ban was lifted in mid-October. India's 41 tiger parks are now open again, although entry regulations are being redefined, to be ratified in April.

At Rajasthan's Ranthambore National Park – among the most celebrated of the tiger sanctuaries – one of the key considerations is tourist volume. ""We're reassessing the carrying capacity of vehicles to determine how many people can potentially look at an animal at the same time,"" says Yusuf Ansari, conservationist and host at the stylish tented camp Sher Bagh (00 91 11 4606 7608; sujanluxury.com) just outside the park. He adds that the known population of 56 tigers in the greater park area has swelled with a number of cubs this year. The hotel features as part of a week's private tour offered by Greaves Travel (020-7487 9111; greavesindia.co.uk) from £2,150 per person, including flights, two nights in Delhi, and four nights and game drives at Ranthambore.

David Mills, managing director of tour operator Naturetrek, says that now is an excellent time to make a tiger trip. Because of the summer ban, many visitors cancelled their bookings so ""the reserves are likely to be unusually free of tourists in the coming months"". Among the small group trips arranged by Naturetrek (01962 733051; naturetrek.co.uk) is a new ""Tiger Direct"" nine-day holiday combining Pench and Kanha parks (the latter was the inspiration for Kipling's Jungle Book) in Madhya Pradesh. The price from £2,095pp includes flights from Heathrow to Mumbai as well as all accommodation and game drives. Alternatively, Explore (0845 291 4541; explore.co.uk) offers a shorter six-day group ""Tiger, Tiger"" Trip in Ranthambore from £499pp, including two nights' accommodation in Delhi, train transfers, accommodation at Ranthambore, four game drives and a visit to Ranthambore Fort (£1,192 with flights).

Lion's share

Slightly smaller than their African cousins and with a more orangey tint to their fur, the world's only Asiatic lions live in Gujarat's Gir National Park in western India. In the mid 1980s, the population of this big cat was just 239; now there are more than 410. Numbers, in fact, are starting to be too great for the park and relocation of some of the animals is becoming necessary. See them with Cox & Kings (0845 527 9047; coxandkings.co.uk) which features the park as part of a 13‑night private tour of Gujarat from £4,050pp with flights from Heathrow to Mumbai, excursions, accommodation and two nights at the Lion Safari Camp in Gir.

Wild elephants

With stupendous thickets of bamboo growing among teak, silver oak and sandalwood, Nagarhole National Park in Karnataka is one of the most striking reserves in southern India. And it is probably the best place to see wild elephants too.

There are an estimated 800 here – along with gaur (an Indian type of bison), wild dog, the odd tiger, leopard and much more. Audley Travel (01993 838300; audleytravel.com) offers a 15-day ""Southern India Explored"" itinerary that includes two days in Nagarhole as well as visits to Mysore, Sultans Battery and Ooty. The trip costs from £3,055pp which covers flights from Heathrow to Bangalore, private car with a driver/guide, and comfortable accommodation.

River and rhinos

The mighty Brahmaputra river is home to rare Ganges dolphin that move like quicksilver and occasionally arch right out of the water. (Blink, though, and you'll miss them.)

On the western bank of this great waterway, about halfway along its course through Assam, is the Kaziranga National Park. This watery world of lakes and marshes is inhabited by more than 1,500 one-horned rhino, as well as wild buffalo, otters and a fabulous range of birds. Happily, there's a great way of seeing all these creatures: the Assam Bengal Navigation Company (assambengalnavigation.com) operates cruises in atmospheric river boats that stop at the park.

Noble Caledonia (020-7752 0000; noble-caledonia.co.uk) offers these cruises as part of a 17-night package to the Assam region. The price from £4,795pp covers flights from Heathrow to Kolkata via Dubai and onward air travel to Guwahati, all accommodation including 14 nights onboard the boat, most meals and game excursions in Kaziranga in 4x4s and on elephant back.

Leopard adventure

The rare snow leopards of the Himalayas are exceptional athletes, able to leap over great mountain ravines, making them extremely difficult to track. However, in February and March next year, Steppes Discovery (01285 643333; steppesdiscovery.co.uk) is taking two small groups on quests to look for snow leopard in the dramatic terrain of Ladakh in the north-west. Led by experts who have worked with BBC and National Geographic film crews, the trips are accommodated in a comfortable campsite from which you visit remote monasteries as well as make excursions to find snow leopard in Hemis National Park. The cost of £2,995pp includes flights from Heathrow to Delhi and onward air travel to Leh, all accommodation and guidance.

Hero of Uttarakhand

Jim Corbett, naturalist, author and conservationist, was a colonel in the British Indian Army who was born in India in 1875 and lived there until 1947. In 1936, he helped establish the country’s first national park in what is now the state of Uttarakhand in the north. Corbett National Park, above, is a little smaller than Britain’s New Forest and it backs on to other wildlife sanctuaries: together they form a vast protected area that contains a remarkable range of flora as well as tigers, elephants, sloth bears, hog deer and more. A five-night stay is offered by TransIndus (020-8566 3739; transindus.co.uk) as part of a week’s package costing from £1,898pp. The price covers flights from Heathrow to Delhi, two nights in the capital, transfers, accommodation at Jim’s Jungle Retreat in Corbett park and all game drives.

Jungle tips

Book your game drives well ahead of your visit, advises Hashim Tyabji, former chief warden of Bandhavgarh National Park and owner of Forsyth’s Lodge (forsythlodge.com), above, on the edge of the Satpura Reserve in Madhya Pradesh. The number of vehicles admitted to the reserves/parks at any one time is strictly limited. Bookings are made through tour operators (in the UK or locally) and hotels. Wear neutral colours, Hashim adds – many safaris are made in open-sided 4x4s or on elephant back, and bright colours will stand out particularly on these trips. Carry binoculars; even small ones will transform your experience. Speak softly and avoid sudden or quick movements. And, he emphasises, don’t pressure your guide and driver to conjure a tiger: you will see much more if they are relaxed and not feeling they have to race around. A five‑night stay at Forsyth’s is offered as part of a week’s trip with Indian Explorations (01993 822443; indianexplorations.com). The price from £1,929pp includes flights from Heathrow to Delhi and onward air travel to Bhopal as well as all accommodation, most meals and game drives, guided walks and motor-boat safaris.",Traveller's guide: Indian wildlife holidays,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL3RyYXZlbC9hc2lhL3RyYXZlbGxlcnMtZ3VpZGUtaW5kaWFuLXdpbGRsaWZlLWhvbGlkYXlzLTg0MTM2NjcuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL3RyYXZlbC9hc2lhL3RyYXZlbGxlcnMtZ3VpZGUtaW5kaWFuLXdpbGRsaWZlLWhvbGlkYXlzLTg0MTM2NjcuaHRtbD9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2012/12/14/00/tg1.jpg,2012-12-14,"{'sent': 'The word derives from Sanskrit jangala, meaning uncultivated ground or scrubland, and was adopted by British traders in the mid-18th century.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sanskrit jangala']}}",Tiger
0,"Rivers in India, especially the Ganga, Yamuna and Brahmaputra all carry a potent spiritual significance. Not only are these water way responsible for sustenance, they are also believed to be living goddesses blessing the land with their bounties. Immersing one’s ashes in the Ganga is said to free you from the karmic cycle of rebirth. Sadly however, most of India’s numerous rivers are heavily polluted with effluents and toxic waste from industries. Although the government has been spending heavily in the cleanup of water ways, there is not much to show for it.

One such tragic story in that of the Yamuna – apart from being a major waterway, it is also home to the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) and the river dolphin (Platanista gangetica). Recently, Tehelka followed all 600 km of the river and found it to be languishing inspite of Rs. 13,000 crores being spent on the clean up under the Yamuna Action Plan which was set up in 1993.

The Taj Mahal which was built on the banks of the Yamuna is also in serious peril.

The vice-president of the Chamber of Industries and Commerce in Agra, Rajiv Tiwari, has stated that the reason for the increased pollution is the entry of unchecked industry and domestic wastes into the river. “The state authorities pay no heed to the rising pollution from industries. There are certain guidelines for industries to discharge water and effluents, but no one follows them and they go unchecked and go directly into River Yamuna. Drains also open up in Yamuna and the government is not taking note of the alarming situation,” said Tiwari.

According to Central Pollution Control Board, around 70 percent of the pollution in the River Yamuna is human excrement and industrial effluents. The government’s apathy towards the worsening condition of the river, has sparked off repeated public protests. Delhi alone produces 3.6 billion litres of sewage every day, but due to poor management, less than half of it is effectively treated. While Yamuna fulfils 60 percent of New Delhi’s water needs, almost the same percentage of the city’s sewage finds its way into the river.

A supreme court commission ordered local municipalities to remove an estimated 90,000 cubic metres of debris by the end of next month. Once a vital source of drinking and bathing water, as well as a main source for irrigation, in seven northern states, the 1,400km river, in some parts, has come to resemble an open sewer.

< The clean-up will focus on two of the most polluted areas of the river: the portion that runs through Delhi and a 200km stretch in Uttar Pradesh. The Delhi Development Authority, the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation and the government of Uttar Pradesh were ordered to pay for the clean-up. The authorities face fines if they miss the deadline. Apart from the threat to human life, the two primary species that call the Yamuna their home are severely threatened. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed the Gharial as a critically endangered and is the most threatened species that is native to UP. According to IUCN, there has been a population decline of 96-98% over a three-generation period since 1946, and the once widespread population of an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 individuals has been reduced to a very small number of widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals in 2006.

Although there have been repeated efforts to reintroduce the gharial into the waters of the Yamuna and Ganga, the habitat destruction has proved too much to support this. Gangetic Dolphin numbers are also languishing. There are 671 dolphins in various northern rivers but only 31 in the Yamuna. WWF-India are keeping a close eye and monitoring the situation.

The perils of industrialization and development are severely threatening India’s rivers and the Yamuna is only one such example. There needs to be some urgent action now in order to improve waste management, sewage treatment and waste disposal facilities.

0,"If you try and draw family trees for animals and plants in India, you will discover something that will take your breath away. Relatives do not occur in the same area; in extreme cases, they can be in other continents. And atop the tallest mountains in the Himalayas, you will find marine fossils.

The relative position of the Indian subcontinent changed dramatically over the last 200 million years, and the signatures of India’s adventures across the seas can be seen in the flora and fauna of the subcontinent. The purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis) is an extreme example illustrating this complex history. A large, bloated looking burrowing frog, the species spends most of the year underground, and emerges for two weeks during the monsoon to mate. It was during the monsoon season in 2000 that a team of researchers at a cardamom plantation in the southern Indian state of Kerala stumbled across this species for the first time. But its most remarkable aspect emerged after careful taxonomic analysis – genetic and morphological analysis showed that the frog belonged to a family thought to be restricted to the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean.

A small rust and red colored butterfly from the high altitudes of the Western Ghats in southern India was thought to be a kind of bushbrown (of the genus Mycalesis), closely related to other Mycalesis species found at the lower elevations. However, in 2010 a molecular study discovered that the butterfly’s closest relative was not from India at all, but from Madagascar.



The dispersion of Glossopteris fossils (green) on the continents in their locations as sections of Pangaea. Legend: 1 South America, 2 Africa, 3 Madagascar, 4 Indian subcontinent, 5 Antarctica, 6 Australia. Courtesy of Petter Bøckman.

In effect, India acted as a biotic raft, a Noah’s ark, carrying a variety of plants and animals from Africa to Asia; whichever species found the right conditions to survive, did. Going back to where we started, the butterfly got onto India before India split away from Madagascar. The purple frog and its relatives in Seychelles would have evolved when India and Seychelles were still together, after which, only Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis got on with life as usual in southern India, and we see it today.

Ultimately, the Indian subcontinent is an amalgam of species from Africa, which it passed on to Eurasia; species from South and Southeast Asia; and species from Central Asia, making it unique, and perhaps worthy of the title, subcontinent.

0,"The Indus blind river dolphin is facing extinction it was learnt on Thursday. The rare dolphin is fading away owing to the negligence of the Sindh Wildlife Department and factors such as water pollution, poaching and habitat destruction. .

Usage of insecticides and pesticides as well as other agricultural sprays is a major reason behind the decline in the numbers of blind river dolphins. In the 2010 flashfloods, dozens of these animals were either killed for their meat or swept away by the gushing water.

The dolphin was declared an endangered species by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Furthermore, a number of industrial units discharge their waste directly into the river which is a great threat to marine life, especially to the said dolphins. These fading animals are often seen stranded in the irrigation canals.

The Indus blind river dolphin is one of the world’s rarest mammals and the second most threatened river species. It is also known as “Andhi Bulhan”. It gives birth to one baby in a year. The dolphin is totally blind but, surprisingly, however it can differentiate between light and dark.

The dolphin has been dwelling in the river Indus for millions of years. It is found only in Pakistan in only the lower Indus basin. It is one of the 39 species of the dolphins found in the world.

The blind dolphin was once found in abundance in the Indus from Khyber Pakhtunkhawa to the delta.

In the past, it also moved frequently to and from the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum.

It is pertinent to mention that the Sindh Wildlife Department had declared the area from Sukkur to Guddu barrages as ‘Indus Blind Dolphin Sanctuary’.

At present there are about 1200 dolphins living in this stretch of the Indus. Indus dolphins are being poached on a large scale because its skin and bones fetch a very high price and are used in medicines.

The Sindh Wildlife Department does not seem keen to rescue the unique dolphin as no concrete measures have been taken despite instructions given by the relevant authorities.

A research has claimed that these dolphins become blind because of muddy water of Indus, but a few scientists believe that IndusRiver dolphins are inherently blind. Some researchers believe that it finds its way and food with the help of echolocation or through a system similar to the one used by bats. The dolphin eats fish and invertebrates such as clams, prawns, carp, catfish, gobies and herring.

The 25 percent of Indus Blind Dolphins that live between Guddu and Sukkur barrages are stranded due to human activity.

All countries except Pakistan are taking serious initiatives for the protection of such species as the IUCN has declared this dolphin “unique and endangered”. Unfortunately the authorities of Sindh Wildlife Department are not performing their role properly.

If serious measures are not taken by the government of Sindh, the country might lose this unique animal.

Thus, it is the responsibility of the Sindh Wildlife Department to take action against factories discharging toxic waste into the river. It is also the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency and factory owners to take some serious steps to secure the endangered dolphin.","Another day, another extinction for Pakistan’s animals species",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBha2lzdGFudG9kYXkuY29tLnBrLzIwMTMvMDgvMDEvYW5vdGhlci1kYXktYW5vdGhlci1leHRpbmN0aW9uLWZvci1wYWtpc3RhbnMtYW5pbWFscy1zcGVjaWVzL9IBbWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBha2lzdGFudG9kYXkuY29tLnBrLzIwMTMvMDgvMDEvYW5vdGhlci1kYXktYW5vdGhlci1leHRpbmN0aW9uLWZvci1wYWtpc3RhbnMtYW5pbWFscy1zcGVjaWVzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cache.pakistantoday.com.pk/2013/08/dolphin.jpg,2013-08-01,"{'sent': 'The Indus blind river dolphin is facing extinction it was learnt on Thursday.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Indus']}}",Indus River Dolphin

On October 22nd Bangladeshi and Indian officials were supposed to hold a ceremony laying the foundation stone for the Rampal power plant, a massive new coal-fired plant that will sit on the edge of the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest. However, the governments suddenly cancelled the ceremony, instead announcing that the project had already been inaugurated in early October by the countries’ heads of state via a less-ornate Skype call. While the governments say the change was made because of busy schedules, activists contend the sudden scuttling of the ceremony was more likely due to rising pressure against the coal plant, including a five-day march in September that attracted thousands.

“The march started from the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka with nearly 5,000 participants but ended up at [near the Sundarbans] with over 20,000 people gathering after five days,” Mowdud Rahman an engineer with Southeast Asia Renewable Energy People’s Assembly (SEAREPA) told mongabay.com, adding that the “historical” march was “the first time we have seen that Sundarbans lies in every Bangladeshi’s heart.”

Opponents contend that the 1,320 megawatt project could devastate the Sundarbans, Bangladesh’s largest forest and the nation’s last stronghold of the tiger. They argue that toxic pollution, water diversion to the plant, and heavy coal barge traffic could leave the Sundarbans an increasingly degraded ecosystem, threatening the livelihoods of half a million people who depend directly on the great mangrove forest.

“No sane person in the world would agree to this project,” Bangladeshi activist, Kallol Mustafa, told TIME Magazine in September.

However, the Bangladeshi government has responded vociferously to allegations that the coal plant will injure the Sundarbans.

“[The Rampal coal plant] will not have any negative impact on the environment. Sundarbans is our safeguard [against natural disasters] and no power plant will be set up jeopardizing the Sundarbans,” declared Bangladesh’s Power Secretary Monowar Islam. The government has dubbed those opposed to the plant as employing “propaganda.”

Still, Bangladesh is consistently rated as among the world’s most vulnerable countries to global warming, with both the government and experts warning that the low-lying country faces rising sea levels, intensifying extreme weather, water scarcity, food insecurity, and potentially millions of climate refugees.

“Bangladesh is already a global hotspot for tropical cyclones and other climatic events and is highly vulnerable to increased intensity of storms and droughts that will result from climate change,” Bangladesh’s Minister of the Environment and Forests, Hasan Mahmud, said last year. “Two thirds of the country is less than five meters above sea level and vulnerable to coastal inundation and salinity intrusion, which we are already experiencing.”

Despite this, Bangladesh is taking a sudden turn toward coal power—the most carbon-intensive energy source—even as it rightly scolds rich nations for their outsized-role in creating global warming.

The Rampal coal plant, which has produced the most opposition and press in Bangladesh, is actually only one of at least a dozen proposed coal plants for the country by the current administration under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Taken together, these projects are a part of an ambitious government strategy to increase electricity generation to 20,000 megawatts by 2021 for the energy-starved nation. But activists contend there are other ways to produce energy that won’t threaten the Sundarbans or exacerbate climate change.

Coal buddies: India and Bangladesh

The Rampal coal plant is not just for Bangladesh. First conceived in 2010, the project is a partnership between the Bangladesh Power Development Board and India’s state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), which will share fifty-fifty ownership of the plant as well as the electricity it produces, although the NTPC is only fronting 15 percent of the cost. Critics contend that despite being a joint project between India and Bangladesh, it’s Bangladesh that will face the environmental and human impacts.

“Coal is big business in India, and no doubt there are powerful interests at play,” says Ashish Fernandes, an expert on coal with Greenpeace India. “If Bangladesh is locked into a coal-dependent energy paradigm, companies like NTPC will make significant profits, at the cost of [Bangladesh’s] people and environment.”

Built just 14 kilometers from the edge of the Sundarbans, the Rampal coal plant would actually violate Indian law that declares that power plants must be set back at least 25 kilometers from forestland. However, in a recent press note, the Bangladeshi government contends that the 14 kilometers is a “safe distance.”

“[India] wants to destroy [the] Sundarbans in Bangladesh part,” local journalist Sushanta Sinha told mongabay.com. He argues that not only will India gain cheap energy from the plant without the environmental drawbacks, but also that the degradation of Bangladesh’s Sundarbans will only heighten the attraction of the same forest across the Indian border.

Sundarbans

Like the Rampal coal plant, the Sundarbans mangrove forest is shared between Bangladesh and India. Around 80 percent of the forest lies within Bangladesh, while the rest is in the Indian state of Bengal. The Sundarbans—both a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Ramsar wetland’s site—covers an impressive 10,000 square kilometers today, and despite once being considered a wasteland by British colonists, the Sundarbans is hugely important to locals who have depended on it for fisheries, wood, and other bounty for millennia.

“[The Sundarbans] plays a significant role in the national economy (3.4% of national GDP) and it is the largest source of forest products in the country,” explains Abdullah Abu Diyan a local environmentalist and guide. “This forest generates large-scale employment and livelihood opportunities during the harvest season of thatching material, honey, bee-wax, fish, crustacean, and mollusk.”

But, the human toll of the coal plant has already started: a number of families, from an estimated 4,000 in total, have already been forcibly remove to make way for the plant. The land they inhabited, mostly shrimp farms and rice paddies, will soon be converted into an industrial site.

Not surprisingly, this massive mangrove forest (about the size of Lebanon) is home to a wealth of species. Biologists have to date catalogued 330 plant species, over 270 birds, 208 fish, 42 mammals, and 35 reptiles in Bangladesh’s last great forest. Many of the species are endangered, including both the Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) and the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris); the masked finfoot (Heliopais personatus), a water bird; Heritiera fomes, an important mangrove species that’s used for timber; and of course the Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris tigris).

“Sundarban is the last remaining habitat of Bengal tiger [in Bangladesh] with no possibility of relocation through corridors,” says Diyan. The Sundarbans are home to over 10 percent of the world’s wild Bengal tigers, about 270 individuals. Three years ago, Bangladesh was one of 13 tiger nations that pledged to double wild tiger populations by 2022. But conservationists say the coal plant could undercut the Sundarban population.

“If the Sundarbans is adversely affected, the tigers will likely be as well,” notes Karolyn Upham a conservationist with the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), who works in the region.

But environmentalists contend that the coal plant could cast a pall over the forest as a whole, not just the tiger. Mangrove forests are among the world’s most important ecosystems: they act as fish nurseries, biodiversity havens, and carbon storehouses. Moreover, in an age of worsening climate change, mangroves provide buffers against worsening cyclones and rising seas.

But, according to the government, the Rampal coal plant will suck up 9,150 cubic meters of water from the river every hour and run it through a desalination plant. Since mangroves depend on a mix of fresh and salt water—often termed brackish—environmentalists not only fear that water levels in the Passur river will run low, but also that the blend of fresh-and-salt water could be disrupted, dooming swaths of the Sundarban’s mangroves.

“The power plant’s proposed location is on the bank of Passur River, which is one of the only two rivers that bring fresh water to the Sundarbans,” explains Diyan. “Any change in Passur river’s quality might be extremely harmful for the entire ecosystem.”

Furthermore, water dumped back into Passur River will be up 20 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the river water, threatening aquatic species.

Coal-fired power plants also spread a toxic menagerie of chemicals into both the air and water, including arsenic, mercury, lead, nickel, and radium. The government says the plant could discharge up to 52,000 tons of sulfur a year, which, depending on the type of coal burned, could lead to acid rain in the Sundarbans and surrounding regions.

“Mangrove ecosystems are known to contain acidic soil, and any disruption may lead to leeching of the acid into the water causing major disaster to the aquatic fauna including the fisheries,” adds Diyan.

The Rampal coal plant will also require around 4.72 million tons of coal every year to burn, which the government says will mean approximately a ship a day carrying coal through wildlife-rich waters. Coal spilling off the barges may lead to possible water contamination, while the ships will also cause daily noise pollution possibly putting species at risk, including dolphins. Just last year, Bangladesh set aside three new areas of the Sundarbans as Wildlife Reserves for the dolphins.

“The water of the Sundarbans and surrounding areas will be affected by discharging cooling water, effluents from the ships, and leaching water of the coal from ships,” environment scientist, Abdullah Harun Chowdhury with Khulna University, who conducted his own assessments on the impact of the Rampal coal plant, says.

But the government of Bangladesh, which did not respond to repeated queries from mongabay.com, has repeatedly argued that the coal plant will have no environmental impact.

“[The Rampal coal plant] would be built using the latest ultra super critical technology, so it would not affect environment of Sundarban,” Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, an adviser to the Prime Minister, said in September.

He added that, “the matter has to be understood with a scientific outlook, not emotion. [Opponents’] criticism is not based on information and technological knowledge. Our decision is based on real terms, and not emotions.”

According to a recent press note from the government the plant will only burn “high-quality imported coal,” and “emissions of carbon, sulfur, fly ash and several other sorts of air pollution will be kept at a minimum level to avoid having any adverse impact on the environment.”

In the same note, the government said the coal plant is “very important to the interest of the people.”

But opponents remain unconvinced.

“While there is no ‘good’ location for a coal plant, situating one in or near a unique and already stressed ecosystem like the Sundarbans is inexcusable,” says Fernandes with Greenpeace-India.

Dueling EIAs

In January of this year, the Bangladeshi government released a 676-page Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Rampal coal plant undertaken by the Center for Environment and Geographic Information Services. However, instead of alleviating concerns, the EIA raised new contentions. For example, the EIA argues that the possibility of acid rain from the Rampal coal plant is “very low” due to mitigation methods and the type of coal burned. But activists say such assurances are not good enough.

“Acid rain… is such a dangerous hazard [that] before deciding to establish a coal based power plant near Sundarbans, one needs to be ensured that there is zero possibilities of these kinds of hazards,” notes Rahman.

Some scientists have also blasted the government’s EIA for downplaying threats and spreading misinformation. The government assessment treats the Sundarbans as a “residential and rural area” and not an “ecologically critical area.” That designation change allows the government to impose lower thresholds for pollutants, including sulfur and nitrogen.

“It defies logic to treat the Sundarbans, the largest mangrove forest in the world…as a residential area,” economist Anu Muhammad with Jahangirnagar University told The Independent newspaper of Bangladesh.

“[The] government is trying to misguide people by false information,” contends journalist Sushanta Sinha.

Furthermore, critics say the government had already tacitly approved the coal plant before the EIA was even written or submitted to the Environment Ministry for approval. In 2010 the government had already obtained 1,834 hectares (4,532 acres) of land for the project, an acquisition that has already pushed some locals off their ancestral land.

“If we look at the chronology of events it would be clear that the EIA process was merely an eyewash, used as an instrument to rationalize a predetermined project,” says Rahman.

But the government EIA is not the only scientific document to investigate the impact of the Rampal coal plant. Before the release of the official assesment, environmental scientist Chowdhury, conducted his own research. Over several years, Chowdhury and his team took water and air samples, monitored biodiversity, and worked with the local community creating an independent EIA. In the end, they reached conclusions vastly different from the government’s.

“Most of the impacts of [the plant] are negative and irreversible which can’t be mitigated in any way,” concludes Chowdhury’s report.

For the love of coal in a warming world

Last month, Maplecroft, a UK-based global risks analysis company, dubbed Bangladesh the world’s most vulnerable nation to climate change. With a massive population—still one of the densest in the world—and widespread poverty, the people of Bangladesh are also expected to suffer gravely as the sea spreads inland. According to projections from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 17 percent of Bangladesh could be engulfed by the sea as waters rise.

The government denies none of this. Last year, Hasan Mahmud, the Minister of the Environment and Forests, stated succinctly, “in Bangladesh climate change is not a threat; climate change is the reality.”

In fact, many have pointed to impacts already occurring in Bangladesh as illustrative examples of the upheaval climate change could cause worldwide.

And this sentiment has been echoed by the very top of the Bangladeshi government. At the UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen in 2009, Prime Minister Hasina said “the refugees caused by climate change increase day by day. The rising sea levels and rising temperatures are destroying the habitat of fish and the lives of our fishermen.”

And she hasn’t changed her position in recent years. Six months ago, Hasima told a summit at the Community Climate Adaptation summit in Dhaka that “we need to act now [on climate change] without delay […] This needs to be addressed at the highest priority.”

Still, Hasina remains a staunch defender of the Rampal coal plant, and her administration is the driving force behind Bangladesh’s sudden investment in coal. Until recently, less than five percent of Bangladesh’s electricity production came from coal with the country producing most of its energy from natural gas and biomass.

Diyan says that the people of Bangladesh have “yet to receive anything from the government justifying their actions in line with climate change.”

The government contends that the Rampal coal plant—and the others—will produce badly needed power for Bangladesh’s 150 million people, about half of whom still lack electricity.

But activists note that in a country with plenty of sunshine and wind, there are many good alternatives to carbon-heavy coal.

Increasing efficiency at existing gas plants could add 2,500 megawatts in one year—nearly double the energy production of the Rampal coal plant—according to engineer, Mowdud Rahman. In addition, he says, Bangladesh should look to biogas, mini-hydroelectric, wind, and solar for its energy needs. Currently, the Bangladesh government has set a goal of producing 5 percent of its energy with renewable by 2015 and 10 percent by 2020.

“Unfortunately this only seems to be a juicy target with no substantial attempt to make it happen,” says Rahman. “Policy makers seem short in innovation but viciously interested in this plant.”

The long march

In September concerned Bangladeshis took their opposition to the streets. Tens-of-thousands participated in a five-day march from the capital to the Sundarbans; thousands of others supported the initiative through social media, according to the march’s organizers, The National Committee to Protect Oil, Gas, Mineral Resources, Power and Ports.

“There is no way that government can deny this huge protest and continuous campaign,” says Rahman.

At the end of the 400-kilometer long march, activist leaders released the “Long March Declaration,” which demanded that the government cancel the project by October 11th.

“We have frequently said there are alternatives for producing electricity, but there are no alternatives to the Sundarbans,” the declaration read.

But to date, the only thing the government has cancelled is the coal plant’s inauguration ceremony. Protestors took to the streets again on the 11th, and this time were halted by police.

“Now is the time to show a common wisdom and make the right decisions for a greener and more habitable world,” Prime Minister Hasina told the world back in 2009 at the Climate Summit, adding, “Future generations will judge us for the choices we make today.”

0,"Australia’s saltwater crocodile has beaten contenders from the US and South America to be named the world’s most aggressive crocodile, as new guidelines are released on how to avoid altercations with the formidable predators.

A study conducted by Charles Darwin University in the Northern Territory found that the Crocodylus porosus, colloquially known in Australia as the saltie, was much more aggressive than six other species of crocodiles selected from around the world.

The research, conducted in Darwin and India, monitored juvenile crocodiles with infrared cameras over two years. The crocodiles were grouped as young hatchlings and animals about a year old.

Researchers found that the saltwater crocodile exhibited vastly more bellicose behaviour than species from Papua New Guinea, South America and south-east Asia. The freshwater crocodile, also found in Australia, was ranked fifth, ahead of the American alligator and the Indian gharial.

The saltwater crocodile underlined its fearsome reputation by being the only species to exhibit agitated tail twitching followed by lunging head strikes on its opponents.

“They are certainly the ugliest when it comes to aggression,” said Matthew Brien, wildlife biologist at Charles Darwin University. “They get in an agitated state then wind themselves up and swing their heads into other crocodiles. When you see larger salties, especially males during mating season, it’s quite fearsome. It’s like a sledgehammer that would certainly shatter your head.”

By comparison, other species of crocodile are social and even gentle with each other. The Indian gharial is, according to Brien, “a real sweetheart”, with a delicate, narrow snout and pleasant disposition.

Brien said aggression in saltwater crocodiles is “hardwired from hatching” but there is no clear explanation why the species is so short-tempered. One theory is that competition with other crocodiles, combined with its sheer size, has instilled the aggression.

The saltie’s No 1 ranking arrived as the Queensland government issued new guidelines on how to avoid being attacked by the animals.

Crocodile handlers have started patrolling the northern beaches of Cairns and have already removed two of the animals. Under the crocodile management plan crocs will be removed from areas popular with locals and tourists and taken to farms or zoos.

The state environment minister, Andrew Powell, said: “While we will do everything we can to put the safety of people first, we must accept that we can never make Cairns entirely croc-free.

“As we move into what we hope will be another busy holiday season it is vital that everyone, including locals and tourists who may be visiting the area on holidays, practise crocwise behaviour.”

The “crocwise” guidelines include a warning not to swim in waters where crocodiles may live and to obey warning signs, a reminder that crocodiles also swim in the ocean and advice not to leave food or bait near water, campsites or boat ramps.

People are urged to stand back from the water when fishing and to ensure they do not “provoke, harass or feed” crocodiles.

Brien said saltwater crocodiles displayed different behaviour when catching prey compared with when they fought each other, but that the vast size of the animals posed significant dangers to people.

“A two-metre croc won’t eat a human, but once you get an animal that is four metres long, humans are certainly on the menu,” he said. “You really do have to take precautions in croc habitat.”",Saltwater crocodile named world’s most aggressive,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDEzL2RlYy8xMi9zYWx0d2F0ZXItY3JvY29kaWxlLW5hbWVkLXdvcmxkcy1tb3N0LWFnZ3Jlc3NpdmXSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMjAxMy9kZWMvMTIvc2FsdHdhdGVyLWNyb2NvZGlsZS1uYW1lZC13b3JsZHMtbW9zdC1hZ2dyZXNzaXZl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/7/13/1279040367791/saltwater-crocodile-006.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ab6160a9f72107ce07a1bfd8363fb1fa,2013-12-12,"{'sent': 'Australia’s saltwater crocodile has beaten contenders from the US and South America to be named the world’s most aggressive crocodile, as new guidelines are released on how to avoid altercations with the formidable predators.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Australia', 'US']}}",Gharial

0,"Among the largest and most endangered crocodilians in the world, the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is on the verge of extinction today. This harmless fish-eating crocodile has fewer than 200 adult breeding individuals in the wild, their numbers having plummeted rapidly over the past few decades due to destruction of their riverine habitats, entanglement in fishing nets, and hunting. But among this gloom and doom, conservationists have been working tirelessly to reinstate the wild populations.

In one such attempt in April this year, a team from the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and Bihar Forest Department released six satellite-tagged gharials into a stretch of Gandak River (a tributary of the Ganges) lying between Valmiki Tiger Reserve and Sohagi Barwa Wildlife Sanctuary. The six individuals included five adult females and one male, bred in captivity at the Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park in Patna (or Patna Zoo).

“It was a great moment to see the captive bred animals going back to the wild, from a small pond at the Patna Zoo to the clean fast flowing river Gandak,” said Samir Kumar Sinha, WTI’s regional head for Bihar. “Interestingly, in India, captive breeding of gharials started with some eggs collected from the Narayani or Gandak river. The release of captive bred gharials in the same river, thus, makes the cycle complete.”

While the gharial population in the wild has remained low, it has been rising fairly rapidly in captivity. To restock the dwindling wild crocodile populations, the Indian government together with the United Nations Development Program-Food and Agriculture Organization (UNDP-FAO), launched a Crocodile Breeding and Management Project in 1975. It was under the aegis of this project that numerous rehabilitation centres were set up for gharials, and other crocodile species. Several thousand gharials were reared in captivity in these centres, and released back into the wild. Subsequently, the project was declared a success.

In 2006, however, surveys revealed otherwise. With less than 200 mature breeding gharials in the wild, their IUCN status was soon changed from Endangered to Critically Endangered. Despite a successful captive breeding program, the restocking of wild populations has yet to prove as effective.

Satellite-tagging of gharials and their continued monitoring after release could, however, help conservationists better understand their movement, habitat use, and ability to adapt in the wild.

“The tagged animals would be satellite tracked for the next 12-18 months (based on the life of the battery in the transmitter). Other physically marked animals would be tracked manually,” said Sinha.

But for the gharials to survive in the wild, various lingering threats need to be addressed urgently. B.C. Choudhury, a senior advisor to WTI and the Regional Vicechair of the IUCN Crocodile Specialist Group, told mongabay.com, “While restocking is an active conservation action, there are lots of other disturbing causes that need to be eliminated from the riverine habitat of gharials. These include maintaining an optimal ecological flow in the rivers, stopping illegal and destructive fishing, as well as agriculture, and sand mining along the river banks that are the egg-laying areas of the gharial and many other aquatic fauna.”

For now, the six released gharials have traveled more than six miles (10 kilometers) from their release site, and have been spotted basking on the sandy river beds very close to other wild gharials in the river, according to Sinha. The team plans to continue to release gharials in the river after the monsoons.

“This will help us compare the adaptability and movement patterns of the gharials pre-and post-monsoon,” said Choudhury. “This in turn will give us an insight into our plans of initiating a similar exercise for the gharials in Bhutan, which have a sizable population in captivity, and require urgent attention for release to the wild.”

Elephants in the midst: warning system prevents human-elephant conflicts in India, saves lives

(05/08/2014) Indian elephants once freely roamed the rich mid-elevation evergreen forests of the Valparai plateau in the Western Ghats, one of the world’s mega biodiversity regions, but they can’t move the way they used to. Ever-increasing commercial plantations and settlements have become obstacles to the daily and seasonal movements of elephants, creating more chances for often-deadly encounters between humans and elephants.

New research indicates that two such species are being threatened by hunting in the Western Ghats of India.

(03/27/2014) In 1864, Walter Campbell was an officer in the British Army, stationed in India when he penned these words in his journal: “Never attack a tiger on foot—if you can help it. There are cases in which you must do so. Then face him like a Briton, and kill him if you can; for if you fail to kill him, he will certainly kill you.” In a stroke of good fortune for the tiger, perceptions in India have changed drastically since Campbell’s time. Tiger hunting is now banned and conservationists are usually able to rescue the big cats if they become stranded while navigating increasingly human-occupied areas. But is this enough to save the tiger?

Europe approves vet drug that killed off almost all of Asia’s vultures

(03/25/2014) When Europeans first arrived in North America, they exterminated three to five billion passenger pigeons (Ectopistes migratorius) in the short span of a century through a combination of habitat destruction and hunting. In 1914, the last living passenger pigeon perished at the Cincinnati Zoo. Despite the staggering scale of this extinction event, three species of vulture from Southeastern Asia retain the dubious distinction of having had the most rapid population crash of any avian fauna. They might not have begun with numbers as large as the passenger pigeon, but within the space of a single decade, their populations were reduced by 96 to 99 percent.

0,"The otherworldly Indus river dolphin is one of only four species of river dolphins left in the world, and its numbers are falling fast in the Pakistani waterways it calls home.

Now a new study has discovered why: As dams are built to divert river water to irrigate crops, the dolphins have become confined to isolated stretches of waterways.

“The link between the construction of the irrigation barges and depletion of river flow matched very well with the timing and the geographic pattern of dolphin disappearance and was even linked with the speed of disappearance,” said Gill Braulik, a marine mammal specialist with the Wildlife Conservation Society in Tanzania and lead author of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.

Braulik and her colleagues studied reports of where the dolphins lived from as far back as the 1870s, just before the first major dam was built. They then compared the times when dolphins were last seen along certain stretches of river with the dates dams were built.

The research shows that dams have chopped the dolphin’s historical range into 17 separate river sections. The dolphins have disappeared from 10 of those sections, and their range is now a fifth of what it once was.

Only 1,100 individual Indus river dolphins survive, according to the World Wildlife Fund. To locate the remaining dolphins, Braulik’s Pakistani coauthors interviewed local fishermen. They had to find the oldest fishermen in each community, a project in itself.

“Elders are very respected in Pakistan,” said Braulik. “We spoke with some very, very old men, some of whom were wheeled out in wheelchairs to speak to us—others could not get out of bed—and they told us amazing stories of a bygone era.”

The Indus river dolphin is no Flipper: It’s brown and blind, and it has protruding, interlocking teeth. The dolphins ply the muddy Indus River, using echolocation—reflected sound—to find one another and the catfish and carp they eat.

“It evolved much earlier than modern marine dolphins and in fact is more closely related to sperm whales and beaked whales in the ocean than to other marine dolphins,” Braulik said.

Though the Indus river dolphin is in dire straits, Braulik said there’s cause for optimism. A balance between development and conservation is still possible, and she points out that although the dolphin’s range has declined, in parts of the river the animals remain abundant. Moreover, government agencies are working with nonprofit organizations to preserve the dolphin.

“There is a need on the Indus—and on many other rivers where there are competing uses for water—to recognize that sufficient flows are required to maintain basic ecological services, and that will benefit ecology and people,” said Braulik.",Dams May Damn the Rare Indus River Dolphin to Extinction,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGFrZXBhcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAxNC8wNy8xNy9kYW1zLW1heS1kYW1uLXJhcmUtaW5kdXMtcml2ZXItZG9scGhpbi1leHRpbmN0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/RTRF5W5_0.jpg,2014-07-18,"{'sent': 'The otherworldly Indus river dolphin is one of only four species of river dolphins left in the world, and its numbers are falling fast in the Pakistani waterways', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one', 'only four']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"Orcas Saving Humans

By Marc Snelling

Oral history of orcas saving humans stretches out for a millennia.

Haida, Tlingit, Nuxalk and other peoples of the Northwest have kept stories and names alive for many generations.

For example, Natsilane being saved from attempted drowning by his jealous brothers is a Haida and Tlingit story.

Nuxalk stories of Ista and Patsallht recount traveling with killer whales and how they got their black color. K’aa gwaay, the five finned killer whale of legends is carved on totem poles such as Ts’aahl Llnagaay at the Haida Heritage Center in Kay Llnagaay (Skidegate BC).

Haida Gwaii and the surrounding island and coastal lands of British Columbia (BC) and Alaska support rich and diverse life.

Stunning traditional art created by the peoples of this land is prized the world over, recognized for its expression of animal and human spirit. A fact recently noted by Lori Saldaña’s in her North Pacific dispatch. No animal figures as heavily in these traditional stories and art as orca.

‘Chief of the Undersea World‘ is a sculpture created by one of Canada”s best known Haida artists, Bill Reid. He was the son of a Scottish-German father and mother from T’aanuu in Haida Gwaii. (Queen Charlotte Islands BC) The original is housed at the Vancouver Aquarium and the above pictured plaster cast features prominently at the Museum of Civilization in the nation’s capital.

Not only did Bill Reid work to revive and continue the tradition, he helped mentor a new generation of artists. Today another generation of artists including Garner Moody, who carved the Ts’aahl Llnagaay totem, and Todd Baker, who creates traditional art, continue to produce these captivating images.

The stories of these nations speak of two times. One ancient – where the dividing line between human and animals was not clear – and today. The stories of orca and first man are intertwined.

The languages that these stories have been told in for generations have their own sound and rhythm.

Sgaan is the Haida word for orca, syut in Nuxalk. Both languages are currently being kept alive by small groups of elders and are in danger of becoming extinct. The number of fluent Nuxalk speakers was recently estimated at fifteen elders. First Voices is a website that has been created to help communities document and preserve this language legacy. Oral history and archaeology show that the Haida and their ancestors have lived in this region for well over ten thousand years.

A new generation faced with an increasingly unbalanced earth has begun to look at these stories from an older time with a new eye. The dominant view of today is short-term. The ancient stories all speak of karma-like concepts and how every action has a consequence, even if it is one felt hundreds of years later. The effects the extraction industries have had on this land over the past few generations only underline the morals of these stories. Increasingly people are seeing the value and message preserved in ancient wisdom and the old ways .

Natsilane was an intelligent, pleasant and skillful young warrior in a time before killer whales. He was an able sea lion hunter and spear carver who took as wife the daughter of a local chief. His traits made him an ideal choice for chief of his people. A fact that made his brothers-in-law extremely jealous. So jealous they plotted to drown him and took him out to sea fishing – further from shore than they had ever been.

His brothers threw Natsilane overboard and paddled away. Left to drown, he is found by sea otter, who floats Natsilane to an island where he is able to settle. There Natsilane carves a totem of a large black fish, grateful for his life being spared. He leaves this totem at the water’s edge. When he returns to shore the next day the carving is gone, and in the water is Blackfish, the first killer whale.

Blackfish guides Natsilane back to his home, where he finds his brothers out fishing in their boat. Natsilane asks Blackfish to destroy their boat, which it does. Natsilane orders that from then on Blackfish is never to harm humans again. Furthermore Blackfish is to help any humans in trouble at sea. Natsilane then returns to his village and becomes a legendary chief.

Some have claimed ot have seen Natsilane riding on the backs of two great black fish. Interpretation and telling of the story varies from family to family. The ending which may sound harsh, is in reality a happy ending. The moral of the story is that nature and good-spirited humans working together can defeat evil-spirited humans.

Ista is a traditional story of first woman and how she came to earth. In telling the story of Ista, Nuxalk people remember who they are and where they come from, their identity as Nuxalkmc. Traditional family origin stories are called Smayusta in Nuxalk.

Graciously they have shared their traditional stories, which enrich people’s of other nations who would read and respect them. Pastsallht, First Born, thought he was alone on Earth. He roamed the land and encountered the Sisawk people, who wore headdresses. Ashamed he was not a member of the Sisawk, Patsallht experienced jealousy, and so he continued his journey. At the water’s edge he met a group of people in a boat, and asked if they would give him a ride. They told him they would but he would have to cover his eyes.

Patshallt felt big waves hitting the boat and came to realize that the ‘people’ he was traveling with were in fact orcas. They traveled to Whannock, but the weather was so rough that the boat capsized.

First Born fixed the holes in the boat with pitch from the trees, burning it over a fire. That is why killer whales are black today. These memories are preserved today in song and dance as well as place names.

Nuxalknalus (King Island) is an island about thirty miles southeast of Bella Coola BC. A creek on this island is known to the Nuxalk people as ISTA – a former village site and place of origin of the peoples. In 1995 and 1997, Nuxalk people were arrested for protecting this area’s old growth forests from clear-cut logging. Their land has never been ceded and no treaty is in place, yet multinational logging corporations have clearcut on the island. The strength in spirit of these activists can be linked to the memory of their Smayustas – their origin stories.

Europeans also share a similar history. Numerous Greek myths include dolphins saving humans. People alive today talk about being saved from shark attacks by orcas. The species “orcinus orca” is actually a member of the dolphin family. One of the six largest dolphin family members are commonly called ‘whales’ for their size, a group also known as “blackfish”.

A man riding a dolphin is also a common Roman theme. This detailed mosaic of a man riding a dolphin is from a first century Roman villa in southern England.

Still other cultures recognize the dolphin as a friend to humans.

In Hindu mythology the goddess Ganga rides a dolphin in the Ganges River. The Ganges River dolphin or ‘South Asian river dolphin’ (Platanista gangetica) is an endangered freshwater dolphin. Ganga is honored in ceremony for good fortune and washing away sin. The actions that create sin are recognized as negative karma in Hinduism. Violating morals and ethics bring about negative consequences – a theme also present in the stories of the first people’s of the Northwest.

While stories of orca helping people are numerous, they are built to kill prey much larger than humans. A male orca weighs on average ten thousand pounds. Their place atop the ocean food chain has led to them being called “killer whales”.

Orcas were first placed in captivity by humans in the sixties. The first captured orca killed itself by running into the walls of it’s tank during it’s first day in captivity.

Since the seventies dozens of reports of captive orcas attacking humans have made news.

In our current decade instances of orcas killing humans have brought attention to the morality of keeping ‘The Chief of the Undersea World” captive. The killing of SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau by Tilikum on February 24th, 2010 and the 2013 movie Blackfish have awakened much discussion on orca captivity. Her death came two months after trainer Alexis Martinez was killed by Keto an orca held at Loro Parque in Spain. Tilikum was previously implicated in the death of Keltie Byrne in 1991, and Daniel Dukes in 1999.

Tanks to hold captive orcas have been built in eleven locations in the world. Three of them owned by the SeaWorld chain of San Diego, San Antonio and Orlando. Ocean makes up over seventy percent of the earth’s surface. Orcas are found in every part of it, from the frigid arctic and Antarctic to the warm tropics.

The natural human footprint by comparison is twenty five percent of the earth’s surface. US law states two fully-grown killer whales can share a tank forty eight feet in diameter and twelve feet deep. A full grown orca is approximately twenty-four feet long.

Using the ancient stories of all nations as a guide it is clear to many that we need to treat orcas better. Not just for their sake, but for our own karma.

These stories also tell us that living in harmony with nature is essential to our long-term survival as humans. These creatures are more intelligent than many realize and have more to teach us then jumping for food and performing for a crowd. Increasingly, people from all over the world are motivated to protect the blackfish. As activists stand up for the respect of animals, the orca is a strong inspiration. Are they not still trying to save us?

0,"The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris ssp. altaica), also known as the Siberian Tiger, is among the world’s rarest and most endangered cat species. The largest and northernmost tiger, it is believed only around 450 of these magnificent, 200kg, three-metre-long cats remain in the wild.

However even this precarious situation is better than in the 1930s, when hunting reduced them to the brink of extinction – around only 20 animals. Today the threat they face comes from illegal poaching for body parts taken for Chinese medicine, poaching of their prey such as deer and boar, and steady destruction by logging of their habitat which makes their long term survival precarious.

Such low numbers in the 1930s and 1940s left the species with a “bottleneck” of low genetic diversity, susceptibility to disease, and poor cub survival rates. Recently an infectious disease that causes viral encephalitis, canine distemper, has been identified as a significant threat to the species’ survival. Researchers estimate that this virus has killed at least 1% of Amur tigers since 2009.

But the worldwide network of zoos can provide a bulwark against extinction. The population of Amur tigers in captivity, at around 480 in 185 institutions, is perhaps larger than those in the wild. The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA) made the Amur tiger a focus of its global species management plan, bringing together the world’s four key regional zoo associations to maintain sustainable captive populations of Amur tigers as a genetic “lifeboat” for those in the wild. The plan also provides an important political framework through which conservationists and governments can share information and cooperate internationally.

Shrinking habitat

Almost all the remaining Amur tigers live in the far east of Russia, mostly in the Sikhote Alin mountain region, and there is little genetic exchange between tigers there and the much smaller sub-population found in southwest Primorye province. A small population exists in China but it depends on animals moving across the border with Russia. It’s not known whether there are still tigers in North Korea.

The forests of the Russian Far East are declining rapidly due to large-scale illegal logging, mainly to supply Chinese furniture and flooring manufacturers, many of which then export to the US and Europe. This over-harvesting of trees reduces the supply of pine nuts and acorns, which are the main food sources for the tigers’ prey. Uncontrolled forest fires and agricultural burn-offs are also reducing the tiger’s habitat.

Hunters replaced by poachers

Russia became the first country in the world to grant the tiger full protection, and its ban on tiger hunting in 1947 was instrumental in preventing the species from being hunted to extinction. Assisted by organisations such as WWF, Russia now has a national action plan for the Amur tiger, with a major step forward being the establishment of the Sredneussuriisky Wildlife Refuge in 2012. Covering nearly 180,000 acres, this allows Amur tigers to cross the Russia-China border, bringing together otherwise isolated tiger sub-populations.

So while conservation efforts in recent years have seen the IUCN reclassify the species down from critically endangered to endangered, poaching and logging of their habitat is still a problem. Stricter penalties for wildlife crime and banning pine harvesting in tiger forests is crucial.

International effort

Sergei Bereznuk is a key player in Russian tiger conservation. The recipient of a 2012 Rolex Award for Enterprise, Bereznuk lobbies against illegal poaching and threats to tiger habitat and heads a small NGO, the Phoenix Fund.

In partnership with the Zoological Society of London and the Wildlife Conservation Society, the Phoenix Fund has improved anti-poaching efforts using better data recording and software tools, and promotes awareness and education for locals living in the area. A key educational event is the annual Tiger Day Festival in Vladivostok, in which over 4,000 schoolchildren and students dressed in tiger costumes paraded through the city in 2013. The Phoenix Fund has also created a network of volunteer fire-fighting teams to tackle forest fires.

Russian conservation projects also benefit from the skills of the likes of British veterinary charity Wildlife Vets International, for which John Lewis provides tiger capture and anaesthesia training to local conservation vets, and makes genetic and health assessments of samples from wild Amur tigers.

But as well as providing financial support to tiger conservation, consumers in the West can play their part in preventing illegal logging in the tigers’ forests by only purchasing Forest Stewardship Council-certified (FSC) products, which provides assurance that legal, environmental, and social protections are in place and forests are managed responsibly.

Perhaps the most difficult challenge is to stem the demand for tiger bone from China. Despite all trade in tiger parts being banned under international law, growing Chinese affluence has seen demand for these products – seen as a symbol of high status and wealth – increase. When one tiger can provide ten years’ income on the black market it seems an irresistible incentive for poachers.",Zoos have a vital role to play in ensuring survival of Amur tiger,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS96b29zLWhhdmUtYS12aXRhbC1yb2xlLXRvLXBsYXktaW4tZW5zdXJpbmctc3Vydml2YWwtb2YtYW11ci10aWdlci0zMDM5MdIBZ2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9hbXAvem9vcy1oYXZlLWEtdml0YWwtcm9sZS10by1wbGF5LWluLWVuc3VyaW5nLXN1cnZpdmFsLW9mLWFtdXItdGlnZXItMzAzOTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images.theconversation.com/files/56391/original/42pb734n-1407925591.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2014-08-14,"{'sent': 'The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris ssp. altaica), also known as the Siberian Tiger, is among the world’s rarest and most endangered cat species.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Panthera tigris ssp', 'Amur', 'altaica']}}",Tiger

SUKKUR: Local legend has it that Pakistan's Indus River dolphin was once a woman, transformed by a curse from a holy man angry that she forgot to feed him one day.

After thousands of years swimming the mighty river the gentle, blind mammal is under threat from a combination of uncontrolled fishing and damage to its habitat caused by man-made dams.

Conservationists are fighting to save the dolphin as well as the river's black spotted turtle, at risk from poachers who hunt it to sell to collectors and traditional medicine dealers.

The dolphin, which can grow up to 2.5 metres, is one of the world's rarest mammals, with a population of just 1,400 living scattered along a 1,200-kilometre stretch of the Indus, which rises in the Himalayas and flows out into the Arabian Sea near Karachi.

They are classed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list of threatened species, which says the population has fallen by more than 50 percent since 1944.

Functionally blind, they use echolocation, a form of natural sonar, to find fish, shrimp and other prey in the muddy river waters.

Sticking their snouts and heads from the waters, the dolphins bring serenity to the river in the shadow of the Sukkur Barrage, built by the British, around 470 kilometres north of Karachi.

Isolation

The monsoon season draws families and picnickers hoping to catch a glimpse of the dolphins.

But the series of dams and barrages built across the Indus since the late 19th century to help irrigate farmland have divided the dolphin's habitat into 17 separate sections.

The dolphin has died out in 10 of these sections, according to a recent study published in the PLoS One journal by experts from Britain's St Andrews University, and the sub-populations are left more vulnerable by their isolation.

When the river recedes after the heavy rains of the monsoon, the dolphins can become stranded in isolated ponds and tributaries, starving them of food and making them vulnerable to predators.

Another threat to the dolphin, whose pinkish-grey skin breaks the surface of the turbid waters as it comes up to breathe, comes from fishing.

“Narrow fishing nets trap the dolphin under the water and she needs to come out to breathe after every one to two minutes,” Muhammad Imran Malik, from the dolphin protection project of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) told AFP on the riverbank in the town of Sukkur.

The WWF has set up a network of fishing communities on both banks of the river and the link canals to keep vigil on any trapped dolphin and report it to conservators.

“We have different awareness activities among local fishermen, communities and other people about the dolphins' habitat, threats and the importance of its existence in the river,” Malik told AFP.

Fisherman Gajan Khan Malah is one of the WWF volunteers who plays a role in monitoring the dolphins. “Some years ago we saw a dolphin stranded in shallow waters, while we were fishing,” Malah said.

“We called the WWF officials and they came instantly to rescue her and we netted the dolphin and handed her to them. They released it in the river,” he added proudly.

Illegal turtle trade

As the WWF and other Pakistani agencies strive to save the dolphin, a new threat to the Indus ecosystem has emerged: smugglers hunting black pond turtles, also known as black spotte turtles, to sell them illegally to clients in China and Thailand.

“There is a market for every species, and this is a very unique turtle. It has a black colour with white and yellow spots, which is fascinating for many turtle lovers who keep them as pets,” said Uzma Noureen, the WWF project coordinator at a sanctuary for rescued turtles.

Around 200 turtles, which are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN list, were smuggled from Pakistan to Taxkorgan in China's Xinjiang autonomous region in June.

Pakistan officials travelled by road to bring the turtles back home to the sanctuary in Sukkur, where they were held in a makeshift quarantine.

“It is like we rescued a ship from the clutches of pirates. We are now releasing them into their natural habitat and it is a great accomplishment for me and my whole team,” said Javed Mahar, chief of Sindh Wildlife Department, as the turtles were slipped into a tributary of River Indus.

Pakistani customs authorities recently recovered at least two consignments of hundreds of protected turtles, which were being smuggled abroad from Karachi airport.

“There is an alarming rise in smuggling cases of the black spotted turtles because of the lucrative market in countries like Thailand and China,” said Ghulam Qadir Shah, researcher at IUCN.

The Indus River dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor) is an endangered freshwater mammal found only in the Indus River and tributaries draining the Himalayas. Since 1879, the dolphin—locally known as the bhulan—has vanished from 80 percent of its range. Now, a study using interviews with dozens of elders in the Pakistani fishing communities along the river documents when dolphins disappeared from different river sections. Their stories suggest that reduced river flows below irrigation dams are the most important factor in the dolphin’s declining distribution.

The Indus River is one of the world’s most heavily used and modified rivers. Researchers suspected the dolphin’s population was falling due to fishing, pollution, canal entrapment, habitat fragmentation, reduced river flows, or some combination of these factors. Recent population estimates have ranged between 965 and 1,300 animals remaining in the river. But scientists didn’t know when or why the dolphins vanished from each section of the river.

Bhulans disappeared from 10 river segments following the construction of irrigation dams starting in 1886, according to a paper published in PLOS One. The blind dolphins, which lack lenses in their eyes but use sophisticated echolocation, managed to survive below six dams that released sufficient year-round flows. But some of the dams diverted so much water to crops that the river effectively dried up in those sections for part of the year.

“Removing all the water from the river has enormous knock-on negative effects that we don’t even fully understand yet,” said lead author Gill Braulik, a biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society and the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

Braulik and her colleagues wanted to count the dolphins from boats in the river, but Pakistani officials said obtaining permits would take a year. Instead, the researchers focused on determining the last time dolphins were seen between pairs of dams. They combined records of the bhulan’s range from an 1879 British survey with their own interviews of elderly riverside inhabitants.

Based on those interviews, the researchers deduced that the dolphins vanished from seven river segments between 1955 and 1988—within living memory of some local fishermen.

“Some of them just loved to talk and talk and tell stories, grandfatherly with the twinkly eyes, and others were just really grumpy, very suspicious. They remembered the period when the British were still ruling the Indian sub-continent,” said Braulik.

But this paper did not account for many other possible influences on dolphin survival due to lack of data, said biologist Claire Risley of Aberystwyth University in Wales, who was not involved in this study.

“So although this study correctly concludes that water discharge rate is a very important factor in determining dolphin decline, it really cannot give information on whether the impact of discharge is greater than the impact of fishing,” Risley told mongabay.com.

Braulik’s work was spurred by the recent extinction of the Yangtze River dolphin, also known in China as the baiji.

“As a person working on another endangered river dolphin, that was a really dramatic wake-up for me,” said Braulik.

But she sees hope for the bhulan: “When you tell people that it’s blind, and that it doesn’t occur anywhere else, there is a kind of national desire to look after and protect this animal.”

Along with the dinosaurs, they split off from a single common ancestor more than 200 million years ago.

The bird family has since diversified into 10,000 different species — finches and flamingos, pigeons and penguins, owls and ostriches. But the crocodilians (including crocodiles, alligators, caimans and gharials) have barely changed at all. They have been aquatic ambush artists, squat, scaly and snaggletoothed, for 100 million years.

Now an international team of scientists led by researchers from UC Santa Cruz have decoded the genomes of three crocodilian species and discovered that — like their bodies — croc genes have evolved at a surprisingly glacial pace compared to birds and mammals.

The researchers published the genomes of the American alligator, saltwater crocodile and Indian gharial Thursday in a special issue of the journal Science.

By comparing the new croc genomes to recently completed bird genomes, the researchers, led by UC Santa Cruz genome scientist Ed Green, were able to reconstruct about half the genome of the ancestral archosaur, the long-extinct reptile-like critter that gave rise to dinosaurs, crocs and birds.

“There’s no place on the face of the earth, no rock you could go look in, no bone, no nothing anywhere, where you could get DNA” from an animal that lived this long ago, Green said. “It’s just not possible. DNA does not survive that long.”

The ability to re-create the genomes of long-extinct animals by comparing their modern descendents could help scientists solve long-standing evolutionary puzzles, Green said.

“This is a biological dig into the evolutionary past,” said co-author David Haussler, who directs the UC Santa Cruz Genomics Institute.

Other scientists may simply use the new data to help put bird and reptile evolution into context.

“I’m excited about the availability of the new genomes,” said Jimmy McGuire, an expert in reptilian evolution at UC Berkeley, who was not involved in the study. “They are essentially ‘preparing the ground’ for the rest of the research community.”

Researchers from around the world came together to decode the 2 billion DNA bases — the letters of the genetic code — of each of the three crocodilian genomes.

The completed genomes let researchers estimate the pace of crocodilian evolution. Crocodiles and alligators split off from a common crocodilian ancestor 100 million years ago. But when researchers lined up the gene sequences of the two modern species, they found that very few genetic changes had cropped up in all that time.

The mammal and bird genomes researchers are more familiar with change 10 times more quickly.

The researchers hypothesized that croc genomes may have evolved slowly because crocs breed slowly. Every new generation is an opportunity for genes to change, and there have simply been fewer generations of the long-lived crocs.

Haussler called the new genomes a step toward the goal of the Genome 10K Project he co-founded in 2009 to create a Noah’s Ark of 10,000 vertebrate genomes.

“The objective is to understand the full molecular details of the tree of life,” he said. “We’re just at the beginning.”","Team led by UCSC researchers reconstruct genome of bird, crocodile ancestor",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbnRhY3J1enNlbnRpbmVsLmNvbS8yMDE0LzEyLzExL3RlYW0tbGVkLWJ5LXVjc2MtcmVzZWFyY2hlcnMtcmVjb25zdHJ1Y3QtZ2Vub21lLW9mLWJpcmQtY3JvY29kaWxlLWFuY2VzdG9yL9IBfGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbnRhY3J1enNlbnRpbmVsLmNvbS8yMDE0LzEyLzExL3RlYW0tbGVkLWJ5LXVjc2MtcmVzZWFyY2hlcnMtcmVjb25zdHJ1Y3QtZ2Vub21lLW9mLWJpcmQtY3JvY29kaWxlLWFuY2VzdG9yL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2014/201412/NEWS_141219915_AR_0_KOEKYYWJLVHQ.jpg?w=1024&h=670,2014-12-11,"{'sent': 'Along with the dinosaurs, they split off from a single common ancestor more than 200 million years ago.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['more than 200 million years ago']}}",Gharial

The army had never before pushed this far into the interior in such numbers. The Gabonese region of Minkébé is normally uninhabited, other than for the occasional hunter or Baka pygmy tribe.

Pressed up against the Congo-Brazzaville and Cameroon borders, its national park is covered by virgin forest. Now it had proved fertile ground for the ivory poachers.

Tusks seized in the US were traced to the region. The few conservationists willing to undertake the trek into the park came out warning that poachers were running amok. The authorities reacted with force. For the first time in Gabon’s history, the army was dispatched into the forest.

Deep in its heart, a camp of 6,000 people was found, ruled by poaching gangs. Weapons were available to any who could afford them, prostitutes were marched up the old logging trails, and witchdoctors sold curses for handfuls of cash. It was a new Wild West, built on the lure of Africa’s “white gold”.

Two hundred Gabonese paratroopers purged the site. By then, however, the worst damage was already done. Some 11,000 elephants had been slaughtered, almost a quarter of the country’s entire population.

When I reached Minkébé you could see the remains of the poachers’ shanty town. Amid the clammy heat there were bars and nightclubs with tatty posters advertising cheap drinks; traders boasting of the prices they paid for ivory and panned gold; rows of wooden sleeping huts being reclaimed by the jungle.

“This was a place with no law and order,” said Dr Joseph Okouyi, now head of wildlife protection in Minkébé. “The big men who controlled the place had their own militia. There were constant fights and people getting macheted to death.”

Since the price of ivory has soared amid China’s economic boom — with the Chinese middle classes showing an almost insatiable desire to spend this new-found wealth on ivory trinkets — criminal gangs have been hunting elephants, and thereby directly challenging the authority of the states in which the animal is found.

For Gabon, Minkébé was the wake-up call. Under President Ali Bongo Ondimba, the wildlife service has been expanded from 60 ecoguards to more than 650, and its budget boosted from $1 million (£649,000) to $18 million (£11.68 million) to pay for new vehicles, uniforms, sniffer dogs and — when required — weapons.

“We’re under attack,” the President told me. “We had US marines come to train our elite rangers to face the enemy in a combat situation. A lot of strength is needed. We were able to save the gorilla. We were able to save the leopard, not least because of ladies refusing to wear leopardskin coats. We must now save some of the elephants.”

Last February, representatives of 46 countries gathered in London to agree a declaration to tackle the illegal wildlife trade, which is worth up to £12 billion a year and rated the fourth most valuable to crime after human trafficking, the arms trade and drugs. The countries agreed a series of actions, including addressing corruption, adopting legislation for tougher penalties against poachers, and recruiting more law enforcement officers. William Hague, then foreign secretary, said he believed this meant “we have begun to turn the tide”.

I came to Gabon to see for myself the extent to which those hopes have be-come reality. Gabon is particularly im-portant to the survival of the elephant, as it is one of the few homes left for one of its three sub-species. The Indian ele-phant and African savannah elephant roam vast expanses of land. But Gabon hosts the last concentration of the smaller forest elephant, whose straight tusks are of particularly fine ivory.

Once, the forest elephant spread across the Congo river basin. Recent years, however, have seen numbers decline sharply in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic as those countries were beset by civil war, criminal gangs and anarchy. In the DRC fewer than 2,000 are believed to be left.

More forest elephants are now found in Gabon than in the rest of Africa combined. It will be in Gabon’s ability to protect its surviving 40,000 that the future of the animal will be decided.

The head of Gabon’s Agence Nationale des Parcs Nationaux is a British-born zoologist, Lee White. He was among the first to highlight the scale of the poaching threat, resulting in the President placing him in charge of the country’s response. He has since overseen the 11 per cent of the country made up of national parks, and led the rapid expansion of the Gabonese wildlife service, which when he took over did not have a single vehicle.

White, 49, is honest about the challenge. Gangs 30-strong are still crossing from Cameroon equipped with satellite telephones, chainsaws for removing tusks, and high-powered rifles that he maintains are often provided by corrupt Cameroon officials.

“If we are not vigilant then we know from experience that things can change very quickly,” he said. “My job is to create a national park service almost from scratch at a time of war because of the situation in Minkébé. The President realises, and the government realises, it is going beyond a wildlife issue and is becoming a national security issue.”

The 12 months since the London conference have seen progress. In Kenya, more government rangers were trained to join the fight, harsher penalties were brought in, and the judiciary has been trained to better expedite poaching cases. Chad destroyed its ivory stockpiles. Malawi pledged to introduce new wildlife protection laws.

But an elephant is being killed every 20 minutes in Africa. Selous in Tanzania still has one of the highest rates of poaching on the continent, while in Mozambique, the situation is almost as bad. A national park in northern DRC is reporting four contacts a week. The savagery of the subsequent firefights has resulted in former French special forces personnel being brought in to aid the local rangers.

It is why I am proud to announce that President Bongo is taking more steps to protect his country’s wildlife. To mark my visit, he signed into law a commitment to send additional troops to Minkébé, triple the length of their deployment, and further strengthen Gabon’s wildlife commitments.

Perhaps most importantly, he also pledged to work with Space for Giants — the elephant protection charity that was the focus of The Independent’s 2014 Christmas campaign, supported by the Evening Standard, and of which I am now patron — to help recruit other African leaders to the anti-poaching cause. He said: “We must act now, and we must act united.” The poaching crisis is an Africa-wide problem. To face it will require an Africa-wide response.

The President has already dispatched wildlife rangers to the Central African Republic to protect that country’s elephants from roving warlord bands. He is also working closely with Chad, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Botswana on the cross-continent Elephant Protection Initiative. But these steps, as he knows, can only be the start. The effort must involve not only governments but the major multinationals operating in Africa and the leading NGOs established there. This is the coalition that needs to work together if the African elephant is to be saved in the wild.

Only then can the commitments of last year’s London conference ever hope to be fully realised — and the poachers leaving Africa’s savannahs and forests littered with bloodied carcasses finally be defeated.

0,"For the first time, conservationists have spotted an Amur tiger dad leading his family along a snowy trail in Russia's Far East forests.

There are fewer than 500 of the rare Amur tigers left in the wild, according tothe Wildlife Conservation Society. The endangered species lives in remote, mountainous territory that makes it difficult to watch the tigers and monitor their natural behavior. So researchers use remotely activated camera traps to help catch the tigers as they hunt, play and move through the vast territory of Russia's Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve and Udegeiskaya Legenda National Park (two adjacent protected areas).

The new photos from the Wildlife Conservation Society show a family of five Amur tigers padding through the snow this winter, lined up from large to small like nesting dolls. Although family group behavior has been seen in Bengal tigers many times, this is the first evidence of male Amur tigers in a family setting, rather than as solitary cats, researchers said. [Iconic Cats: All 9 Subspecies of Tigers]

""We have collected hundreds of photos of tigers over the years, but this is the first time we have recorded a family together,"" Svetlana Soutyrina, deputy director for scientific programs at the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, said in a statement. ""These images confirm that male Amur tigers do participate in family life, at least occasionally, and we were lucky enough to capture one such moment.""

The 21 photos show the tiger family walking in front of the same camera within 2 minutes.

""These photos provide a small vignette of social interactions of Amur tigers, and provide an evocative snapshot of life in the wild for these magnificent animals,"" Dale Miquelle, Russia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in the statement.

The camera trap was part of a camera network installed throughout the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve and Udegeiskaya Legenda National Park during a 2014-2015 population count of the endangered Amur tigers. Every 10 years, hundreds of volunteers survey the remote region to estimate the tiger population. In 2005, there were 430 to 500 tigers remaining in the wild, according to the survey.

Amur tigers once ranged throughout the Russian Far East, northern China and Korea. But by the 1940s, hunting and habitat loss brought their numbers down to only 40 tigers left in the wild. Thanks to conservation efforts, the population rebounded to around 500 by the 1980s, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. However, the tiger population is restricted to reserves in the Russian Far East and China.

Camera traps have also helped monitor the population of another rare Russian cat — the Amur leopard. Photos and video footage from the World Wildlife Fund suggest the number of Amur leopards has nearly doubled, from 30 in 2007 to 57 in 2014.

LAHORE: “The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-Pakistan) is set to embark upon an extensive survey to assess Indus River dolphin populations,” said project coordinator Uzma Noureen on Sunday.

She said the Indus River dolphin was a threatened river cetaceans living in five sub-populations in a 1,000 kilometre stretch of the river’s main channel. She said an in-depth survey was a regular practice taken up every five years since 2001. The last survey was completed in 2011.

She said in 2001, 2006 and 2011, the dolphin population was recorded at 1,200, 1,600, and 1,452 respectively.

She said the survey could cover Jinnah barrage southwards to Kotri barrage.

She the wildlife and the irrigation departments of the Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would participate in the survey.

She said the goal was to discourage illegal fishing practices that were the biggest threat to the blind Indus dolphin. She said the WWF-Pakistan had taken up some awareness projects in this regard.

She said area between Guddu and Sukkur barrages had been notified as the Indus Dolphin Game Reserve by the Sindh government. She said the protected area of about 200 kms had the largest population of Indus River dolphins.

“We are negotiating with the Punjab government on this matter as there is a range of precious biodiversity here as well,” she said. She said the Indus River dolphin swam sideways, was functionally blind and navigated through echo location to find its prey.

She said its average life span was 30 years.

“The present distribution of Indus River dolphin is about 80 per cent less than what was determined in the 1,870s,” she said.

0,"Any reference to the Chambal valley evokes a sense of adventure—a sense of unknown danger lurking in its ravines, gorges and hillocks. This fear largely kept away human settlements from the banks of the Chambal, which makes its way through Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

There are many dark myths associated with the river. Ancient Indian texts refer to it as Charmanyavati—originating from the blood of thousands of cows sacrificed by the Aryan king, Rantideva. The river is considered “unholy"" in Hindu tradition.

Yet today it replenishes and revives the Yamuna just before it joins the Ganga at Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. Sangam at Allahabad, the Hindu holy place where the famous Kumbh Mela is held, is alive because of the Chambal, a tributary of the Yamuna.

Chambal’s ecosystem, however, is under threat. Over the past couple of decades, as the danger posed by dacoits and robbers has diminished, more human settlements have come up in the lower reaches of the river. Now, the Madhya Pradesh government is planning to reclaim the ravines.

In January, it unveiled the “Madhya Pradesh Vision Document 2018"" and revived the “Ravine Reclamation Project"". This will involve flattening ravines and hillocks along the banks of the Chambal, Kalisindh, Betwa and Kwari rivers, turning them into arable land.

Activists and conservationists fear that the plan, if implemented, will destroy the riverine ecology altogether.

The Chambal is home to the endangered gharial, a unique fish-eating crocodile, and the Indian Skimmer, an endangered bird so called because it skims the water’s surface with its orange feet and long flappers and pounces on small fish with its orange beak. The river is also home to the mugger, a freshwater crocodile, and eight species of endangered turtles.

A 400km stretch declared the National Chambal Sanctuary in 1978-79, under the Crocodile Conservation Project for the protection of the Indian Gharial, has a swathe of ravines on both sides. This wetland sanctuary, which cuts across state borders, is the only one focused on the conservation and management of gharials and mugger crocodiles.

Himanshu Thakkar of the South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People has this to say of the Madhya Pradesh government’s plan: “At the outset, it seems like an idea devoid of ecological understanding. The ravines play a significant ecological and social function. Large parts of them have steep slopes and other parts are habitat to biodiversity. Any macro change in these ravines will have an impact on the land, river, biodiversity and environment.

“This needs to be assessed and any decision should only be made based on the participation of local communities. It is also an interstate issue involving three states and the interstate National Chambal Sanctuary. In fact, in the past, more than one effort has been made with huge expenses, with little success.""

Earlier, there were hardly any industries or large-scale agriculture along the river. It stayed largely unpolluted, sustained rich biodiversity, and was deemed one of the cleanest rivers in the country. There are still very few industries but the river’s muddy banks, where wildlife thrives, are now under threat from agriculture and livestock grazing along its entire length. Indiscriminate sand-mining along the banks is also destroying the critical nesting habitat of gharials and ground-nesting birds. The nesting period starts around March-April, when the water levels begin to go down.

“Fishing nets across the river are quite common. These nets trap and kill gharials and turtles along with fish. Illegal fishing has increased, with locals using crude bombs and pesticides to kill fish,"" says conservation biologist Dharmendra Khandal. Otters, too, have come under attack from fishermen, who believe they harm their catch, and poachers, who have sought them out for their prized skins. They have almost disappeared from the lower Chambal area.

Khandal and his team from Tiger Watch, a non-governmental organization, have been patrolling a 100km stretch of the river from Pali Ghat to Rondhai Ghat, in Rajasthan, for seven years to monitor gharial and Skimmer populations.

Khandal says Chambal’s health should be assessed not just by the number of gharial and Skimmer groups, but also by the way that large parts of the riverbank are turning into a human-dominated landscape. Water levels have fallen, and dams and barrages have taken control of the flow from the upper reaches.

Quite apart from all this, the ravines still hold many a secret in their furrowed folds. There is more than one kind of danger to the classic badlands of the Chambal.

0,"Wellington: A long extinct New Zealand dolphin was linked to India's endangered Ganges river dolphin, researchers in New Zealand said on Tuesday.

The newly-described ancient marine dolphin fossil, found in the Waitaki area on the east of the South Island, was of the same ""superfamily"" as the Ganges river dolphin, said University of Otago researchers.

The fossil species, named Otekaikea huata, joined only a few other dolphins known from about 22.5 million to 24.5 million years ago, Ewan Fordyce, a professor, said in a statement.

At that time, New Zealand was a cluster of small low islands with extensive shallow warm seas.

In life, the fossil dolphin's skull was about 80 cm long, and its body around 2.6 metres.

""The fossil has a surprisingly long projecting tusk that became broken in life, but whether this was from fighting or feeding is uncertain. It's likely that it had four or more tusks in life, but these others weren't preserved,"" Fordyce said.

Otekaikea huata belonged to the once-diverse and widespread dolphin group called Platanistoidea, which is now extinct in the oceans and is represented only by the endangered Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin subspecies, Xinhua news agency reported.

""Our study is one of several showing that the South Asian river dolphin lineage was more diverse in the past,"" he said.

""It is not clear why this lineage became extinct in the oceans, but it could have been due to long-term climate change and competition from later-evolving ocean dolphins.""",Ancient New Zealand dolphin related to Ganges river dolphin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vemVlbmV3cy5pbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9zY2llbmNlL2FuY2llbnQtbmV3LXplYWxhbmQtZG9scGhpbi1yZWxhdGVkLXRvLWdhbmdlcy1yaXZlci1kb2xwaGluXzE2MDYzNzcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2015/06/03/364387-dolphin.jpg,2015-06-02,"{'sent': 'Wellington:', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Wellington']}}",Indus River Dolphin

The Siberian tiger population continues to rebound, according to the latest numbers from the subspecies’ stronghold in Russia. Ten years ago, conservationists estimated 423-502 Amur tigers in Siberia. But last month, the Russian government and WWF said numbers had risen to 480-540 tigers, including an estimated 100 cubs.

“This success is due to the commitment of Russia’s political leadership and the tireless dedication of rangers and conservationists in very difficult conditions,” said Igor Chestin, the head of WWF-Russia.

Tiger conservation has been a rare environmental priority for Russia’s current government as Vladimir Putin has consistently highlighted the importance of the world’s biggest cats. It’s thought that around 95 percent of the world’s Siberian tigers are still found in Russia.

Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), also known as Amur tigers, were almost wiped off the face of the Earth. In the 1930s, the population dropped to just 20-30 individuals before being saved by conservationists over decades. The species remains endangered by deforestation and prey decline, but poaching for their body parts is still the biggest threat to the Siberian tiger.

Even as the population grows in Far East Russia, the subspecies may be returning permanently to China as well. Camera traps have caught individual tigers across the border in China over recent years. Then earlier this year, a camera trap video showed a family of tigers–a mom and two cubs–for the first time in China, showing that the subspecies was very likely breeding there. In all, scientists believe more than two dozen Siberian tigers live along the Russian-Chinese border.

China is currently mulling removing barbed wire and other impediments from the border crossing at Primorsky Krai to allow both tigers and Amur leopards easier crossing.

“In nature there are no borders and predators do not have passports, so it is not in our power to tell tigers when to go to China or come back,” Sergei Aramilev, the director of the Primorsky branch of the Siberian Tiger Centre, told The Siberian Times. “The recovery of the tiger numbers in China will create a backup of the population, which may in the future be used to increase the genetic diversity that is important for populations with low numbers.”

No one knows if North Korea still houses Siberian tigers, but there is still suitable habitat there.

Siberian tigers are the world’s largest cats and one of the biggest land predators. They are easily distinguished from other tiger subspecies due to their considerably shaggier coats adapted to the long, rough winters of Siberia. Tigers, worldwide, are in crisis. Conservationists estimate only around 2,500 survive

In 2010, the 13-tiger range countries pledged to double the world’s tiger population by 2022 and raised over $300 million to achieve this goal. Tiger populations are currently growing in India, Nepal, and Russia. But the outlook is far more bleak in many other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia. The last century saw three tiger subspecies go extinct. Today, six remain, though one—the South China tiger—is likely extinct in the wild.",Happy tigers: Siberian population continues to grow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxNS8wNi9oYXBweS10aWdlcnMtc2liZXJpYW4tcG9wdWxhdGlvbi1jb250aW51ZXMtdG8tZ3Jvdy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.mongabay.com/wp-content/themes/mongabay_v1/img/icons/favicon.png,2015-06-09,"{'sent': '\n\n\n\nCaptive Siberian tiger at the Wildlife Conservation Society’s', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Wildlife Conservation Society']}}",Tiger

Twice the length of a human, this monster dolphin sea animal has a beak similar to a dolphin, but puzzles scientists because it also has fur.

No one knows exactly what to make of this discovery as its nothing ever seen before.

According to the Siberian Times, there are some who think it’s the remains of a Ganges River dolphin(South Asian River dolphin) which can be found in India.

The species is under threat because its habitat is in constant danger due to the building of damns and irrigation projects in the region.

Maybe fleeing from its environment, this so-called South Asian River dolphin found its way to Russia.

But experts insist that the fresh water River dolphin found in South Asia, couldn’t survive in salt water and would never attempt to make it so far.

It just doesn’t make any sense.

[Tweet “#Monster #Dolphin Found On Russian Beach”]

This sea monster is also twice the size of the Indian dolphin species and is covered in fur.

“Judging by the appearance of the head, this is clearly some big dolphin”, said Nikolay Kim, Deputy Head of the Forecasting department of the Sakhalin Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography.” According to a characteristic of the skin, it is a rare species”.

There are many social media jokes about this crazy looking creature.

Some even say this animal had to grow fur because of Russia’s cold climate.

Other experts are saying it could be some pre-historic creature that died and became frozen in the permafrost.

The fact is, no one is certain what this unusual find is all about.

0,"The popula­tion of Indus River dolphi­ns is sharpl­y declin­ing and may soon entire­ly disapp­ear from our waters­

KARACHI: One of the myths around the Indus River dolphin is that a woman was cursed by a holy man and transformed into a dolphin after she forgot to provide him food one day. While previously these dolphins could be found in the entire Indus River system, today their distribution range has reduced substantially — about 80% less than what was determined in the 1870s.

The Indus River dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor), locally known as bhulan, is a side-swimming mammal found in the Indus River. It is also known as the ‘blind dolphin’ as it doesn’t have a crystalline eye lens, an adaptation mechanism that enables it to survive in murky waters. However, it has a fully developed echolocation mechanism to sense its surroundings and identify prey and potential threats. Experts believe the population of the Indus River dolphin has decreased substantially owing to human-led activities. According to Uzma Khan, director biodiversity at WWF-Pakistan, “The Indus blind dolphin faces multiple threats including overfishing, fish poisoning, increased use of illegal nets, deforestation along the Indus deteriorating the dolphin’s habitat, fragmentation of the river due to dams and barrages, lack of freshwater, agro-industrial pollution and extensive agriculture.” Additionally, the chief conservator of the Sindh Wildlife Department, Javed Ahmed Mehar, says, “illegal nets and fish poisoning are the biggest threats to Indus river dolphin today.” He emphasises the need to promote sustainable fishing practices in order to ensure long-term conservation of Indus River dolphins in Pakistan.

The Indus River dolphin was even hunted in the past as people extracted oil from its body parts for medicinal purposes. Today, barrages have restricted the dolphins’ habitat, as water scarcity and low flow affect the creature’s free movement from downstream to upstream of the barrage. An increasing number of threats have confined the dolphin to the main channel only. Presently, the Guddu and Sukkur barrages host the largest population of Indus River dolphins. Therefore, in 1974 the government of Sindh issued a notification designating these areas as “protected areas”. This 200 kilometre stretch is also known as the Indus Dolphin Game Reserve.

WWF-Pakistan, in collaboration with the Sindh Wildlife Department (SWD), is actively engaged in rescuing dolphins stranded in canals and releasing them back into the main stream. Communities are sensitised to report stranded dolphins so they can be rescued before it is too late. Since the 1990s, WWF-Pakistan and SWD have rescued 116 dolphins. In 2014, with the help of local communities, three stranded dolphins were saved and released into the mainstream. On April 7, 2015, WWF-Pakistan and SWD jointly rescued a male dolphin stranded in Patt Feeder Canal, Guddu Barrage, through the help of locals. The dolphin was later released in the mainstream of the Indus River, downstream of Guddu Barrage.

Estimating the population of the Indus River dolphin at an interval of five years is of great importance to streamlining conservation management initiatives. WWF-Pakistan has so far conducted three comprehensive surveys in 2001, 2006 and in 2011. The study conducted in 2001, led by Gillian T Braulik, revealed about 1,200 dolphins exist in the Indus River between Jinnah and Kotri barrages. This was followed by the 2006 and 2011 studies, both supervised by Braulik, which revealed a total abundance of 1,442 dolphins and 1,452 dolphins, respectively. Furthermore, the 2011 study revealed two distinct river sections with maximum dolphin population: Taunsa-Guddu and Guddu-Sukkur river sections holding 91% of the dolphin population found in the Indus River. As a result, Uzma Noureen, coordinator of the 2004 Indus River Dolphin Conservation Project, which aims to conserve the biological diversity of the Indus River, ensure the sustainable use of natural resources and find ways to curb pollution, says, “The area between Taunsa and Guddu which represents the second largest population of Indus River dolphin needs to be declared a legally protected area for dolphins.”

WWF-Pakistan through another project titled Improving livelihoods of fishermen communities of Central Indus Wetlands Complex through Effective Natural Resource Management is empowering fisher communities to promote conservation by establishing community-based organisations (CBO) in the area. With 10 CBOs established in Sindh and Punjab, the message of conservation has spread among local communities who now value the biodiversity of the region. One of the CBOs, Indus Welfare Foundation (IWF), established on the west bank of Taunsa Barrage, is raising awareness among communities to reduce their dependence on natural resources and conserve the Indus River dolphin. The president of IWF, Javed Iqbal, says communities are sensitised to protect the endangered dolphin by all means, as it is a source of livelihood and helps promote tourism and other job opportunities.

Mortality rate

Between 1992 and 2010, the dolphin mortality rate was zero to two dolphins per year. In 2011, however, around 28 dolphins were reported dead due to over-fishing and fish poisoning.

0,"Amitav Ghosh’s celebrated novel ‘The Hungry Tide’ is set in the Sunderbans and one of its protagonists arrives in the region to study the Gangetic River Dolphin. What follows in the story’s narrative makes you fall in love with not only these dolphins, but also their habitat – the Sunderbans, where river Ganga and Brahmaputra do an entwined dance.





They are locally known as ‘susu’ due to the noise they make while breathing. This species inhabits parts of the Ganga, Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers in India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. It is also found in Karnaphuli river in Bangladesh. The Ganga dolphin is a critically endangered species in India and has been included in the Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

These extremely rare fresh water dolphins are also found in Indus river, and theory suggests, are originally marine creatures which adapted themselves to fresh waters during the formation of Himalayas. Need not mention, there are many mythologies surrounding the beautiful animals. What’s more? The Ganges river dolphin is also India’s national aquatic animal.

The river tigers

As per an estimate, the number of dolphins in the Ganga was around 3,500 in 2014, a drastic drop from over 5,000 in the early 1980s due to a variety of reasons. The decline in Ganga dolphins clearly warns us about the poor status of the river. Industrial pollution, pesticides, unregulated use of fishing nets, arbitrary sand mining, poaching and accidental deaths are cited as major threats to the survival of these dolphins.

Officials claim anywhere between 10 and 15 per cent of Ganga river dolphin are killed annually. In fact, Ganga river dolphins are like the tigers of forests. These dolphins are in the top position of the food chain in the eco-system of the river. So, their growth is important for the good health of river Ganga.

First ever unified survey

India will soon launch the first unified survey to enumerate the endangered Ganga dolphins, whose count is an important indicator of the health of the river. The survey would be simultaneously conducted in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal from October this year and results are likely to be available by February next year, sources at the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), functioning under the Union Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga rejuvenation.





According to NMCG sources, it would be the country’s first national-level survey for the head count the Ganga dolphin in the river using the direct count method of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). “Though some States have independently surveyed Ganga dolphins in the past, they followed different methodologies for their enumeration. Henceforth, we have decided to conduct a collective survey using a standard method to know the population and distribution range of the species,” an NMCG official told PTI.Rs two crore has been earmarked for the purpose, the official said, adding about 450 surveyors, including stakeholders such as local villagers, academicians and NGOs. The survey would be carried out by the forest departments of the respective state governments, the official said. The survey is being conducted as part of the government’s flagship ‘Namami Gange’ programme, which integrates the efforts to clean and protect the Ganga river.

As part of the survey, there are also plans to carry out the head count of other indicator species such as turtles, gharials, otters and aquatic birds.

An estimated 450 volunteers, government experts and conservationists will take part in the exercise, which spans the states of Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, in November and December.

""This is the first time a unified survey will be done for an aquatic animal. It has been done for elephants and tigers but this is more complicated,"" Dr Sandeep Behera, consultant at the government's National Mission for Clean Ganga, told The Sunday Times. ""We are doing the survey in winter, when water levels drop and we can capture numbers in small isolated pockets and get a good idea of the population.""

The government also hopes to gauge the health of the river in the process. ""This time we have taken aquatic biodiversity as an indicator of how pollution is affecting the Ganges,"" said Dr Behera.

The 2,500km-long river, which is considered holy by Hindus, who believe a dip in it cleanses sins, is heavily polluted with millions of tonnes of industrial effluent, sewage and pesticides. Cleaning it up has been a goal for decades and the Modi government has pledged more resources to tackle the pollution, including allocating more than 200 billion rupees (S$4.3 billion) to the river.

Restoring its biodiversity, with the dolphin as the centrepiece, has also now become a part of the action plan for the Ganges.

The dolphin unified count - meaning it is not just a piecemeal effort by individual conservationists - will provide baseline data that environmentalists say is crucial for saving the endangered species. Estimates put the number of the grey-brown mammals at between 1,500 and 3,600.

""After the count, we will identify the hot spots and those areas will be given priority for protection and conservation,"" said Dr R.K. Sinha, head of zoology at Patna University, who has dedicated 35 years to the conservation of dolphins. The count would also help create a conservation network.

Known locally in some areas as Susu because of the sound it makes when breathing, the Ganges River dolphin, distinguished from its ocean counterpart by a longer snout and stockier body, was once found in large numbers in the river and its tributaries. Over the past few decades, its numbers have dropped dramatically. Pollution, low water flow because of irrigation demands, and barrages and dams have taken a heavy toll.

Poaching has also been a problem, with fishermen catching dolphins for their oil, but conservationists say that is now less common.

Still, in 1996, the dolphin went from vulnerable to endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature list. ""Degradation of habitat is the most important factor in the fall in dolphin numbers. Water flow is declining because of water-intensive farming and increasing pollution,"" said Dr Sinha.

Conservationists want India to avoid the fate of China, where the Yangtze River dolphin, which was last spotted in 2002, has been listed in some reports as extinct.

There is only one other river dolphin species, in the Amazon River, and a subspecies of the Ganges dolphin in the Indus River.

""We want to know the exact number. It is very important for conservation efforts,"" said Mr B.A. Khan, principal chief conservator of forests in the state of Bihar. ""We will also be surveying the smaller tributaries, which has not been done before.""

Said Dr Behera: ""We hope the population has increased in pockets where they are getting support and food. But the target is to bring the endangered species back to the river system.""

0,"Pakistan is raising a special police force to curb crime, strengthen rescue and relief operations during floods and help conserve the endangered Indus dolphin along the River Indus.

The first 700 recruits for the Riverine Amphibious Police Force (RAPF) will graduate in February next year, after being trained by the Pakistan army.

The force will be deployed in districts of Punjab through which the Indus flows , including Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan, Layyah, Bhakkar, Mianwali and Attock.

The Indus River is one of the longest rivers in Asia, flowing over 3,000 kilometres from Tibet through India and into Pakistan.

The Indus provides essential water for agriculture and livelihoods, but has also become a hotbed of criminal activity as armed groups have carved out safe havens for themselves on islands in the river.

“Bandits and criminals have established their sanctuaries on islands in the Indus and have been challenging the writ of the state for many years now,” said deputy inspector general of police Sohail Habib Tajik.

He said the RAPF would help enforce the law on the waterway. “Some areas along the Indus have become the headquarters of kidnappers and criminals because the police can not reach them on the islands,” explained Tajik, who is also commandant of the Sihala Police College where the police personnel are undergoing initial training.

In July 2013, around 60 criminals captured three islands in the Indus in Rajanpur district of Punjab province and took eight police hostage. The area is notorious for killings and kidnapping by armed gangs.

“The traditional police are not well enough trained or equipped,” Tajik said, adding the RAPF will have the latest gear including motorboats, communication systems, navigation tools and weapons.

The force will also keep check on the trade of illicit weapons and movement of militants between districts along the Indus.

Flood rescue force

The RAPF personnel will be trained in swimming, diving and equipped with speedboats and life jackets and so will also act as first response in rescue operations during floods.

Pakistan is highly vulnerable to flash floods every year. The country’s epic floods of 2010 led to the deaths of almost 2,000 people, displacing 18 million others and damaging 12 million homes.

“The personnel of the special force could reach any flood-hit area within five to ten minutes and ease pressure on the army too,” said Pervaiz Amir, country director for the Pakistan Water Partnership.

He said the Pakistan army’s involvement in rescue and relief operations generates goodwill among the public, but their main role should be to protect the nation’s borders.

The Punjab Emergency Service only has 14 divers and around two dozen swimmers and so cannot carry out rescue operations alone. “The dedicated force would help save hundreds of lives,” Amir said.

The RAPF personnel will also be given training in conservation of natural habitat and particularly the endangered Indus River dolphin. Around 1,400 dolphins, locally called Bulhan, live along the 1,500-kilometre stretch of the Indus in Pakistan and are listed as endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

“The force could help in the conservation of dolphins and increase ecotourism in the area by expelling criminal elements from the Indus,” said Aftab Rana, president of the nonprofit organisation Sustainable Tourism Foundation Pakistan.

If the force succeeds in restoring a sense of security in the area, dolphin boat safaris in Punjab can help boost local economy and culture. “The area is now considered unsafe for tourism,” Rana said.

Bringing back eco-tourism

The RAPF can also help local conservationists monitor the number of the dolphins in the Indus – currently the numbers are only estimates. “Nobody dares to stay in the river for long for fear of being kidnapped or killed by criminals hiding on the islands,” he said.

A 10-member team monitoring dolphins at Taunsa barrage was kidnapped by the criminals in 2011, Rana said, though they were later released on the request of some local influential people.

In the future, the RAPF will also be deployed to protect parts of the Pakistan China Economic Corridor (CPEC) and Chinese engineers working on the raft of energy and infrastructure projects worth US$46 billion agreed earlier this year.

Tajik said the RAPF personnel will be stationed along the corridor to protect railway tracks, stop attempts to sabotage projects and ensure the safety of people working and travelling along the corridor.

“It may take three years to raise a force for the purpose,” he said.

0,"If you recall the emotional impact of the 2009 documentary The Cove, you know how horrible it is to witness the spectacle of hunters trapping and slaughtering dolphins. But it was also gratifying to our feelings of outrage, because it seemed like something we could fix, through public exposure and international pressure.

It’s infinitely harder to come to terms with the fate of animals like the blind dolphins of the Indus River in Pakistan and India. Nobody stabs or beats them to death anymore. Hunting ended by law in the early 1970s. But that is not exactly saving the subspecies. Instead, the Indus River dolphins are on the Red List of endangered species. They have lost 80 percent of their old home range, which once extended almost 2,200 miles from the Arabian Sea to the foothills of the Himalayas.

Starting in the early 20th century, construction of irrigation dams began subdividing the dolphins’ habitat into a current total of 17 segments. Ten of them are now devoid of dolphins. According to a new study in the journal Biological Conservation, 1,200 to 1,750 individuals survive—with 70 percent of them confined to a single 118-mile stretch of river.

Related Dams May Damn the Rare Indus River Dolphin to Extinction

That raises the disheartening prospect that the river dolphin could join Mexico’s vaquita and China’s baiji, or Yangtze River dolphin, on the spiral down to extinction.

I phoned lead author Gill Braulik, who spent years doing fieldwork on the Indus for WWF-Pakistan. She looks at the dolphin’s plight from a different perspective—an upbeat one: The dolphins are still there, they have proved resilient in the face of appalling change, and if the world decided to take action on their behalf, they could survive indefinitely. There is hope.

These river dolphins belong to a group of freshwater dolphins that emerged about 29 million years ago, tens of millions of years before marine dolphins. They grow to about seven feet in length, live perhaps 35 years, and hunt by highly sophisticated echolocation (their eyes are rudimentary pinholes, because vision would be a useless extravagance in the heavily silted waters of the Indus). Their long, toothy snout ends in the characteristic upturned “smile” of other dolphin species. By rights, they should be the charismatic poster species for saving the ecosystem.

Their ecosystem is in dire need of saving: The dams have already destroyed a shad migration that once supported a major local fishery. Hunting has largely eliminated mugger crocodiles, as well as two species of otter. Once abundant freshwater turtles have fallen victim to a booming Chinese traditional medicine trade. The gharials, another crocodile species, are gone from the Indus, along with most of the large riverside animals—tigers, leopards, cheetahs, and Indian rhinos. That makes the river dolphin not just the top predator but the sole remaining large aquatic species in the entire Indus River system, and one of only five freshwater dolphins in the world.

The problem for the river is the booming human population. Pakistan is home to 188 million people and is on track to top 307 million by midcentury. They depend on the Indus River for the overwhelming majority of their drinking water, as well as for food, the economy, and intermittent electric power. The dams back up the river water and divert it into a complicated system of irrigation canals to support the cultivation of wheat, sugar cane, and cotton on the Indus plains. Parts of the river system downstream run dry for much of the year.

The farms being fed by this irrigation rely increasingly on pesticides, which quickly find their way into the river. Cities upstream also dump 90 percent of their municipal and industrial wastewater into the river without treatment. The dolphins are thus “exposed to some of the highest levels of pollution of all cetaceans,” according to the new study, and their tissue is loaded with heavy metals, DDT, PCBs, and other toxic substances.

In addition to the agricultural dams, Pakistan now has plans to install 19 hydropower dams on the river or its tributaries over the next 10 years, and India has other such projects in the works upstream. Trying to stop those dams is not realistic and might prove counterproductive, according to Braulik.

“Water is so enormously political and emotional in Pakistan because it’s so limited,” she said. “Everybody knows about the river; that’s where the water for the country comes from. You talk to shopkeepers in the bazaar, and they know about withdrawals.”

So where’s the hope for the Indus River blind dolphin?

First, there are people in Pakistan who care passionately about dolphin conservation. In 1974, Pakistan designated an Indus Dolphin Reserve upstream of the city of Sukkur, and volunteers there regularly take schoolchildren out onto the river to see the dolphins. The reserve’s dolphin population has steadily increased, despite the lack of regulations on fishing or other threats. (In a 2011 case, fishers dumped insecticides directly into the river to increase their catch, accidentally killing six dolphins in the reserve.)

The strength of the population in some areas of the river opens up the possibility of translocations, according to Braulik and her coauthors. It wouldn’t require taking dolphins out of the fast-flowing river, which would be hazardous for dolphins and conservationists alike. But river dolphins sometimes get trapped in irrigation canals, and WWF-Pakistan and the Sindh Wildlife Department already rescue them from otherwise certain death. Translocating those dolphins to river segments that now have as few as 10 individuals could keep those populations going and prevent inbreeding.

But the bigger change would require substantial investment—first for the complicated research to find out what kind of flow the dolphins need to survive, and then to introduce the concept of water conservation. Pakistan now focuses all its efforts on taking more water from the river and the aquifer and almost nothing on conserving what it already takes. But researchers have been pointing out since the 1980s that 40 percent of the water being taken from the Indus now goes to waste. Improvements such as properly lining irrigation canals could save an estimated 14.8 billion cubic meters of water—and dolphin habitat—a year.

What can individuals do? Donating to WWF-Pakistan is one way to help. Another hands-on approach is to travel to the Indus River and do the work of dolphin rescue firsthand.

That’s what came to mind for study coauthor Randall Reeves: “Young people willing to go to a really risky place on behalf of wildlife, people who have a commitment, a desire, a willingness, and a dedication” can join those already working in Pakistan and make a difference, “not just for dolphins but for wildlife generally. It can be done.”

Without that kind of commitment, the 29-million-year history of the Indus River blind dolphin might come to a conclusion this century.",Rare Blind Dolphins Have a Reason to Hope,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGFrZXBhcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAxNS8xMC8wMi9pbmR1cy1yaXZlci1kb2xwaGluLWVuZGFuZ2VyZWQtaG9wZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/indus-river-blind-dolphin-MAIN.jpg,2015-10-02,"{'sent': 'It’s infinitely harder to come to terms with the fate of animals like the blind dolphins of the Indus River in Pakistan and India.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['India', 'Pakistan']}}",Tiger

West Bengal will soon have India’s first community reserve for dolphins. It is being set up with the view of protecting the endangered Ganges river dolphins.

Ganges dolphin was declared the national aquatic animal of India in 2010.

Often called ‘Tiger of the Ganges’, the river dolphin has the same position in a river ecosystem as a tiger in a forest, and their number is estimated to be less than 2,000. These mammals are named River dolphins because they cannot survive in salt water alone. They need freshwater too.

The Ganga stretch in West Bengal, also known as Hooghly, is about 500 km long and passes though Kolkata before meeting the Bay of Bengal in the Sundarbans. According to Chief Wildlife Warden, and Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife), Azam Zaidi, this stretch is not within a forest or a sanctuary, and thus it is important to protect the dolphins in the region. The reserve will be set up in the Hooghly River, between the Malda and South 24 Paraganas districts. The final decision for the reserve was taken at a meeting of the State Wildlife Board.

“A committee is being formed to examine in what way the community reserve would be set up in the Hooghly River between Malda and Sundarbans. We’ll take all stakeholders together in this initiative. It is expected that it would be ready within a year’s time,” Azam Zaidi told PTI.

He added that Wildlife Protection Act has provisions for creation of such reserves to protect the flora and fauna in an area. With this reserve, the board also wants to spread awareness about dolphins being endangered, to control noise pollution in the area, and to have cleaner water. Currently, dolphins are being affected because of the construction of dams and barrages, increased fishing and pollution in the river.

According to a World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) factsheet, the Ganges River dolphins are found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.

Mr Lever, who owns the Koorana Crocodile Farm, says more crocodiles are coming into town in search of fresh drinking water.

""This is an El Nino year and it's obviously very, very dry,"" he said.

""That means there are no little freshwater puddles below the barrage for the crocodiles to drink from.""

Locals have filmed and reported seeing multiple crocodiles swimming in the Fitzroy River near Rockhampton CBD and at Yeppoon Main Beach in the past month.

Loading

Last week, a 2.5 metre crocodile was filmed swimming in the river under the rail bridge in Rockhampton.

The week before, a croc was filmed lunging at a tinny in the same river.

The Department of Environment and Heritage Protection has also confirmed a crocodile was sighted in Gavial Creek near Rockhampton.

There are also unconfirmed reports at Stony Creek in Byfield and near the meatworks on the Fitzroy River.

Mr Lever said saltwater crocodiles cannot drink saltwater, they have to drink fresh.

""Why we're seeing them in the middle of town now below the barrage is they're all coming up to the fish ladder to get a drink or they're all coming to the sewage treatment outlet pipe in Quay Street to get a drink,"" he said.

He said they were the two areas the crocodiles would know to go to where there was a guaranteed freshwater supply.

Mr Lever said when he moved to Rockhampton in 1980, no-one ever saw a crocodile, except for the professional fishermen on the river at night.

He said in the 30 years since, the crocodiles have got a lot bigger and were not afraid of humans because they had not been chased or hunted.

""We're not manipulating the population anymore to make them afraid of us, that's the dangerous part,"" he said.

Mr Lever wants to see the crocodiles moved from the area above the barrage in the Fitzroy River, which is a recreational zone.

""The Government does have a plan to remove some crocodiles from that area but they haven't been successful in getting them as yet,"" he said.

He said the plan was to remove crocodiles in public recreation areas that were more than two metres long but said there were some crocodiles in the Fitzroy area at the moment that were about four metres long.

""There have been attempts made to catch the larger ones but with no success as yet,"" he said.

Sightings attributed to warmer temperatures, mating season

The Department of Environment and Heritage Protection has a conservation plan in place which aims to ""protect the estuarine crocodile as a vulnerable species"" while addressing a system to manage ""crocodiles of concern"".

The department said the increased sightings were due to the warmer temperatures and the start of mating season.

Rockhampton's senior ranger for wildlife management, Frank Mills, said the number of crocodiles in the area were steady all year around, people just did not see them.

""The numbers certainly aren't increasing, they seem to be very stable,"" he said.

He said the warmer weather heralded the start of crocodile breeding season and the crocodiles could become more unpredictable.

KARACHI: Two Indo-pacific humpback dolphins continue to be stranded in Gharo Creek as they cannot escape due to possible barriers near the Harjina Bridge.

The two dolphins, common in the coastal belt, have been seen in the creek near Gharo city by local fishermen. Thinking they could make money by selling the mammals, villagers tried to catch them and hit one of the dolphins with sticks, locals informed The Express Tribune.

Eco-unfriendly: Only 918 Indus dolphins left

A two-member team of the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF) started a rescue operation in the creek on Monday morning but failed to move the animals to deeper waters.

“The operation to move such animals physically is very risky. It can harm them,” said Moazzam Khan, technical adviser at WWF and head of the Pakistan Whale and Dolphin Society.

Khan confirmed that one of the dolphins has been injured. “But it is a minor injury,” he said, adding that it is normal for these dolphins to be stranded in creeks due to the low tides.

“There is no awareness among the people. They believe these dolphins will either harm them [so they try to hurt them] or they think of selling them,” Khan said.

5-year practice: WWF to assess Indus River dolphin

Asif Sandilo, senior communications officer at WWF, believed the move back to deeper waters was not possible due to faulty construction at the bridge.

According to villagers, the dolphins have been visible in the creek for the last 20 days or so. “People hit the fish [dolphin] with sticks in fear of being harmed,” local resident Abdul Ghani said. He added that thousands of people from nearby villages and Gharo city gathered around the water. “No one was sure what kind of fish the local villagers had caught.”

WWF officials said it was not so easy to move dolphins from the location where they are stuck.

“We have to make a plan,” Khan said, adding that all stakeholders including the Thatta district administration is on board.

Hong Kong’s dolphins at risk of disappearing

“Our team tried but it wasn’t possible for us to rescue these animals,” Sandilo said. Quoting a local villager, he said there were three dolphins. “I think one has moved to the deeper sea,” he added. Marine experts have urged authorities to move the dolphins back to the sea as there is a fear that locals will try to catch them and end up hurting the animals.

Uncertainty again looms over the project to re-introduce the critically-endangered Gharial into Punjab’s Beas waters at village Karmowal, upstream and outside the limits of Harike wildlife sanctuary. The Punjab government had secured the approval of the government of India to procure 30 Gharials from the Eco-centre at Deori (Morena, Madhya Pradesh). Though Gharials were scheduled for release in February-March, the irrigation wing’s plans to clean the canals branching to Rajasthan from April 22 have introduced the first obstacle.

In a parallel development, a section of the local populace instigated by vested interests, has lobbied with top politicians to stymie the project citing exaggerated fears of Gharials gobbling their kids. This, despite the proven fact that fish-eating Gharials do not attack humans and the forest department having secured panchayats’ consent for the project through a public discourse exercise in 2015.

A powerful lobby out to sabotage the project is the fishing mafia, aided by corrupt local elements within the department. This lobby fears that Gharials will hit their catch, improved scrutiny by the department and wildlife NGOs over the Gharials will disrupt their illegal forays into sanctuary waters, and that migrant fishermen labour will refuse to enter the river citing ‘magarmachh’ threat.

Another complication is the controversial noting of the WWF-India ‘technical’ representative on the department’s Gharial committee, who advised against shifting Gharials to Punjab from Morena in March citing a 10 degree celsius differential and consequent injuries to Gharials during transportation as the reptiles would be active and thrash about in the warm weather. However, this objection has been over-ruled by Punjab chief wildlife warden Dhirendra K Singh on the advice of Gharial specialists, who foresee no such injury threat. A pre-release enclosure for the Morena Gharials is being built at the department’s office complex at Harike to keep the reptiles till release time. The Gharials can also be kept at Chhatbir zoo, where 11 hatchlings from the zoo’s own Gharials have already attained a desired release length of 1.2 m.

A MAGNIFICENT MADNESS

In February-March when the Silk cotton (semul) tree’s fiery blooms tower over the jungle and crown it with a queen’s tiara, a ‘madness’ seems to engulf award-winning painter Sabia Khan. This Delhi-based painter and teacher in a Darya Ganj Government school says the blooms’ beauty and the tree’s minimalist gigantism overwhelm her. She paints the semul and its nectar-seeking tenants with a smouldering intensity.

Her semul obsession or fecundity has spawned over 500 paintings and drawings, including canvases of 6 x 8 feet featuring specifically 108 birds or 108 squirrels. ‘’108 takes from the number of beads in a ‘mantra mala’ and adds to ‘9’ symbolising the cosmos,’’ says Sabia. In other semul canvases, birds, squirrels, butterflies, and others, perch among blooms and look at her straight in the eye, reflecting trust and openness. The eye to eye contact, according to Sabia, is the essence of love’s unspoken dialogue and its pre-condition.

Sabia’s painting of a kingfisher looking into her eyes amid semul blooms (Sabia Khan )

‘’We come from nature, and will ultimately return to it. Unlike humans, nature’s creatures do not betray our trust. They take feed from you, remain loyal, and go their ways,’’ Sabia told this writer.

An ‘Award of Honour’ was bestowed upon Sabia in 2015 by ‘WE: A Group of Contemporary Women Artists, Chandigarh.’ Her paintings are displayed at exhibitions held at Punjab Kala Bhawan, the most recent being from March 4-8. She earlier won the National Cultural Scholarship (1993-’95), 10th Yuva Mahotsava Award (Sahitya Kala Parishad, 1996) and the 44th National Academy Award (Lalit Kala Akademi, Delhi, 2001). Her solo/group shows in India and abroad, publications, collections, are too numerous to detail in `wildbuzz’s’ snappy space!

LET’S BEE TOLERANT

Thankfully, the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) is restoring humanity’s wrecked honeymoon with honey bees. Bee ‘’attacks’’ take place mostly in spring, which is the swarming season. For the last few years, MC or fire brigade employees have not deployed diesel-fueled flame throwers to burn down hives and kill bees but have merely smoked out ‘troublesome’ bees. This smoking method does not kill them. On Thursday, bees stung many people at the Manimajra police station, while on Monday bees disrupted a cultural event at the Sukhna lake promenade but the bees were not annihilated.

The MC’s chief sanitary inspector Om Prakash says the evolving policy is to convince people not to shoo away ‘’environment-friendly’’ bees. If the city is to revel in an abundance of petals, then these ‘’bee beasts’’ are natural attendants to blooming beauties. Some people are convinced by this argument to live with bees, and this number of tolerant humans is slowly increasing via positive information disseminated through media, reveals Prakash. If people are adamant, or the situation is sensitive like a hive in a school compound, then employees smoke out bees, which often return to the spot.

No environmental clearance has been granted to any project on river Ganga in the last two years, government told Rajya Sabha on Monday.

When members during Question Hour expressed concern over the impact various projects could have had on the flow of the river, environment and Forests minister Prakash Javadekar said “during the last two years, the Ministry has not granted any environmental clearance to projects on Ganga.”

Maintaining that uniterrupted flow of water in the river was a matter of priority, he said the flow of the river is one of the conditions stipulated in environment clearance granted to hydropower projects.

“The ministry recently considered the unfettered and uniterrupted flow of minimum 1000 cusecs of water in the natural river basin for the proposed hydropower projects in river Ganga and its three main tributaries i.e. Alaknanda, Bhagirathi and Mandakini based upon the outcome of proceedings of a conference held at Hardwar in December 1916,” he said.

Javadekar also said that work on 24 projects on the river had been stopped by the Supreme Court while also mentioning the efforts made to clean the river.

A 780-pound “monster” gharial was slain in a hunt after it was allegedly attacking cattle in Florida. When hauled out of the water with a farm tractor, the giant reptile fell short of the state record for length, according to a wildlife official.

“A big alligator nonetheless, but they are not going to have an official measurement because it’s not going to beat the record,” Tony Young, spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said in a phone interview.

The longest alligator caught in the wild in Florida was measured at 14 feet 3-1/2 inches, he said. The state record for the heaviest gator taken from the wild is 1,043 pounds, according to the commission’s records.

The animal killed on Saturday in a hunt at Outwest Farms in Okeechobee near the Florida Everglades was estimated by farm officials to be about 15 feet long, local media reported.

Outwest Farms charges $550 to $10,000 for hunting alligators up to 13 feet and longer, according to its website.

Farm officials believe the alligator was attacking cattle, local media reported.

The gator was discovered in a pond where cattle came to drink, hunting guide Blake Godwin told local news station Fox 13. The hunters used a farm machine to pull it from the water after shooting it, he added.

Outwest Farms posted a photo of what was described as a “monster” capture on Facebook, where a photo of the large animal dangling in the air from the farm equipment prompted mixed feelings. The post later appeared to have been taken down.

“This is making me physically ill,” one person said in a post.

Another poster defended the kill: “For anyone that is talking about relocating this beast ... Why not y’all mess with a 15-foot, 800-pound gator? That gator could easily take your life like he was that cattle.”",15-feet-long ‘monster’ gharial weighing 800kg killed in Florida,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vd29ybGQvMTUtZmVldC1sb25nLW1vbnN0ZXItYWxsaWdhdG9yLXdlaWdoaW5nLTgwMGtnLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1mbG9yaWRhL3N0b3J5LWE4ckVseFJZTHRsRzFBd1Y1cms4bE8uaHRtbNIBiAFodHRwczovL20uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL3dvcmxkLzE1LWZlZXQtbG9uZy1tb25zdGVyLWFsbGlnYXRvci13ZWlnaGluZy04MDBrZy1raWxsZWQtaW4tZmxvcmlkYS9zdG9yeS1hOHJFbHhSWUx0bEcxQXdWNXJrOGxPX2FtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_640x362/HT/p2/2016/04/07/Pictures/florida-alligator-pound-mason-lightsey-father-pictured_726ae30e-fc93-11e5-89a7-e0427befb59e.jpg,2016-04-07,"{'sent': '07:28 IST\n\nA 780-pound “monster” gharial was slain in a hunt after it was allegedly attacking cattle in Florida.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['IST'], 'GPE': ['Florida']}}",Gharial
0,"The 13-million-year-old fossils of an extinct crocodylian, named ‘the storyteller,’ suggest that South American and Indian species evolved separately to acquire protruding, ‘telescoped’ eyes for river-dwelling, according by Rodolfo Salas-Gismondi from the University de Montpellier, France, and colleagues.

The gavialoids are a diversified group of mostly extinct long-snouted crocodylian species. Many of the evolutionary relationships between these species remain unclear; fossils of extinct gavialoids from South America and the extant Indian gharial gavialoid have similar telescoped eyes, but it was not known how these features evolved.

The authors of the present study examined Peruvian fossils from a 13-million-year-old South American species, the oldest known gavialoid crocodylian from the Amazon, which they named Gryposuchus pachakamue after Pachakamue, a pre-Hispanic South American ‘storyteller’ god thought to have knowledge about the origins of South American life. The fossils were dated as Middle Miocene and came from the Pebas Formation, which was likely made up of swampy waterways, suggesting that the crocodylian had a river-dwelling lifestyle. It had only slightly telescoped eyes. The researchers conducted phylogenetic and morphometric analysis to assess the likely evolutionary development of the protruding telescoped eyes of Indian and South American species.

Their analysis suggested that the ‘storyteller’ crocodylian with slightly telescoped eyes represents the ancestral condition from which the South American lineage evolved telescoped eyes. The eyes therefore evolved in parallel in South American and Indian lineages, at first showing partial telescoping as in the ‘storyteller’ crocodylian, and eventually becoming fully telescoped as seen in later-evolving species. Both South American and Indian species adopted a river-dwelling lifestyle, and it is likely that telescoped eyes were adaptive, helping them to catch fish in these habitats.

Although further research is needed, thibs study may further our understanding of both the ‘storyteller’ crocodylian and the evolution of all gavialoid crocodylians.

0,"Crocodiles’ eyes aren’t really appealing to humans or their prey. Those telescoped eyes allow them to be highly stealthy in their hunting and river dwelling, cruising along beneath the water surface with only the eyes and nostrils showing.

Thanks to a 13-million-year-old crocodile fossil, scientists found that South American and Indian species of the animal separately evolved to develop wide-spaced, excessively protruding eyes.

The fossil is of the Gryposuchus pachakamue, which belonged to the group of mostly extinct crocodiles called gavialoids. Researchers ventured to know the evolution behind the telescoped eyes shared by fossils of the extinct South American gavialoids and Indian gharial gavialoids on the other side of the world.

The study conducted by Rodolfo Salas-Gismondi and his team at the University of Montpellier in France analyzed the fossil found in Peru, where they probed 206 varying facial characteristics ranging from the head’s size to the snout’s length to the nostril’s width.

The unearthed fossil – dated to the Middle Miocene era and suggested to be a river dweller as it came from the swamp-ridden Pebas Formation – had only slightly telescoped eyes. Its Indian kin from the same period, however, had already developed that characteristic.

Based on the team’s analysis, it was practically parallel evolution at work: the crocodiles in the Western Hemisphere simply got started later than their Indian counterparts.

“Both South American and Indian species adopted a river-dwelling lifestyle, and it is likely that telescoped eyes were adaptive, helping them to catch fish in these habitats,” reported the authors.

These findings offer insights into whether a specific trait, such as telescoped eyes, could have evolved separately yet in parallel with similar animals from different habitats who found the same need for adaptation.

This seeming demosntration of parallel evolution sheds light on the process of evolution, which is deemed endless and simply continuously changing over the last 3.5 billion years. Could this mean that life on Earth will march on even if the human species ever becomes extinct?

The findings are published in the journal PLOS ONE.

0,"Prof Ravindra Sinha has been responsible for creating awareness about conserving the endangered Gangetic dolphin. Recognising his efforts, the Central Government honoured him with the prestigious Padma Shri this year.

The Gangetic dolphin is a fresh water dolphin that is found in the Gangetic basin in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Essentially blind , these dolphins hunt by emitting ultrasonic sounds that bounce off their prey.

On the brink of extinction, their current number stands at a mere 2,000.

For someone who grew up watching these dolphins from the river banks in Patna, it was but natural to be concerned about their survival. Meet Prof Ravindra Sinha from the Zoology Department at Patna University. Fondly known as the ‘Dolphin Man of India’, he has been waging a war to conserve the endangered dolphins in the Gangetic basin for the last two decades.

The Ganges river dolphins are subject to many threats. Many have died due to entanglement in fishing nets and other gear, pollution in the river from industrial wastes, pesticides, municipal sewage discharge, and noise from vessel traffic.

They are also hunted by fishermen for their meat and oil, which is considered to have medicinal properties. The oil is used by the fishermen to attract catfish too. Much of Prof. Sinha’s work is about tackling these threats.

Things weren’t all that easy when Prof. Sinha started out on his mission. The concern was less and awareness about the dolphins being on the verge of extinction was low. There was reluctance to grant funds to carry out research work on the conservation of dolphins. Taking the task all upon himself, with a small team of six members, Prof. Sinha set up the Dolphin Foundation. The foundation conducted extensive surveys, meeting fishermen on the banks of the Ganges, educating them and making them aware of the need for conservation.

He included the local people in the effort, calling them ‘dolphin mitra’ and also launched awareness campaigns among students of schools and colleges. Thanks to his persistence, in the year 2009, the Central Government declared the Ganges River Dolphin as the National Aquatic Animal.

Recognizing his efforts and contribution towards conservation of the Gangetic dolphins, the Central Government this year honoured him with the prestigious Padma Shri award.

Prof. Sinha is the first scientist from Bihar to be awarded the Padma Shri. He also claims to have come up with a substitute for dolphin oil for use by fishermen for catching cat fish.

“What I can do is educate and convince fishermen about the harmful fallout of killing these dolphins,” says Prof Sinha.

The conservation of Gangetic dolphins has become his life’s passion. He has helped establish the Vikramshila Dolphin Sanctuary in Bhagalpur, the country’s only such controlled ecosystem. Prof. Sinha has also written scores of research papers and books on dolphins. This exhaustive work by him has earned him the prestigious Order of the Golden Ark award of The Netherlands.

Promotion

Today, Prof. Sinha is a member of the National Ganga River Basin Authority of India. He aims to set up Asia’s first Dolphin Research Centre in Patna with funds sanctioned by the state government so that intensive research on this aquatic animal can be undertaken.

One of the most endangered crocodilian species, this crocodile has been eliminated from most of its historic range by hunting. Small populations remain in Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and East Kalimantan.

American alligator hatchlings (Alligator mississippiensis)

Unlike most crocodilians, these shy predators often hunt on land, prowling the forest at night. Growing up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) long, they live in tropical hardwood forests in central West Africa.

Central African slender-snouted crocodile (Mecistops sp.)

The smallest living species of crocodilian — males grow to be 4 or 5 feet (1.2 or 1.5 meters) long — dwarf caimans make up for their small size by sporting heavy armor in the skin of the back and belly that protects them from predators and rough terrain. This forest dweller lives in the Amazon and Orinoco river basins of South America in shallow forest streams.

The name ""gharial"" comes from the Hindi word for pot and refers to a bowl-shaped cartilaginous growth on the tip of the snout. Only sexually mature males develop this ghara, which may act as a resonator to help amplify sounds used in social communication. They live in rivers in India and Nepal, and males grow to 18 feet (5.5 meters) or more.

Gangetic River Dolphin is locally known as ‘Sihu’ and fewer than 2000 such animals remain in the River Brahmaputra along Guwahati.

The district administration had organised online and off-line voting among three protected creatures to decide the ‘city animal’. These three creatures are Gangetic River Dolphin, Black Softshell Turtle (Bor Kaso) and Greater Adjutant Stork (Hargila) and are on the verge of extinction.

In the three-month long voting process Gangetic River dolphin received 24247 votes out of 60003 total votes.

On the other hand, the Greater Adjutant Stork got 18454 votes while the Black Softshell Turtle got 17302 votes.

The Kamrup metropolitan district administration organized the voting process along with other organisations such as the Assam forest department, Assam state biodiversity bard and an NGO, Help Earth.

About Gangetic River Dolpin

The Ganga Dolphins are also called as the ‘Tigers of Ganga’ as it enjoys the position in Ganga that is equivalent to that of the tiger in the forest.

Its scientific name is Platanista gangetica.

Ganges River Dolphins prefer deep waters, in and around the confluence of two or more rivers. They share their habitat with crocodiles, fresh water turtles and wetland birds.

The distribution range of the Ganges River Dolphins in India covers seven states namely, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

Rivers where these dolphins are found: River Ganges, Chambal (Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh), Ghaghra, Gandak (Bihar and Uttar Pradesh), Sone and Kosi rivers (Bihar), River Brahmaputra from Sadia up to Dhubri and Kulsi River, a tributary of the Brahmaputra river,

The Ganges River Dolphin has a sturdy, yet flexible, body with large flippers and a low triangular dorsal fin. It weighs up to 150 kg. Females are larger than males.

The Gangetic Dolphins are generally blind and catch their prey by emitting an ultrasonic sound which reaches the prey.

A Ganges River Dolphin Conservation Programme was initiated in 1997 to build a scientific database of the population status of the species and study the habitat quality of the dolphins' distribution range.

0,"At least 200,000 of the nearly 2m trophies collected from animal hunts were endangered species, according to report revealing the scale of the industry

Around 1.7m animal “trophies” have been exported across borders by hunters in the last decade, with at least 200,000 of them endangered species, according to a new report.

US hunters are by far the largest killers of trophy animals, including half of all the 11,000 lions shot in the last decade, the report found. The issue came to global attention in July 2015, after a US dentist paid more than $50,000 to kill a lion called Cecil, who was being tracked by conservation scientists.

The report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), based on official records, sheds new light on the scale of the international trophy-hunting industry.

It found the number of lions hunted for trophies tripled to 1,500 a year in the last decade, while the number of elephants killed by hunters more than doubled to 1,600. The total number of animal trophies may be much higher as those that remain in the country where they were killed are not recorded.

“The trophy-hunting industry is driven by demand and, sadly, demand for animal trophies is prevalent worldwide,” said Philip Mansbridge, director of Ifaw UK. “Even in the face of extinction, imperilled species are still being hunted every day in order to serve as the centrepiece of someone’s decor. It is unconscionable in this modern day where species are under so many threats to survive.”

Three of Africa’s “big five” - elephants, lions and leopards - were in the top six targets for trophy hunters. More than 10,000 elephants and the same number of leopards were killed as trophies in the last decade, along with more than 8,000 lions.

The most popular target was the American black bear, of which 93,000 were hunted in the last decade, with the Hartmann’s mountain zebra the second biggest target with 13,000 deaths. Large numbers of baboons (9,500) and hippopotamuses (6,000) were also hunted as trophies in the last decade.

Trophy hunting is expensive: hunters pay $25,000-$60,000 to kill an elephant, $8,500-$50,000 for a lion and $15,000-$35,000 for a leopard. Supporters of the industry argue that the money raised can fund conservation efforts and Prince William has argued it can be justified in some circumstances.

In April, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said: “Legal, well-regulated trophy hunting programmes can – and do – play an important role in delivering benefits for both wildlife conservation and for the livelihoods and wellbeing of indigenous and local communities living with wildlife.”

But others strongly disagree. “Many scientists and organisations reject the ‘killing them to save them’ philosophy that hunters tout as their justification,” said Azzedine Downes, president of Ifaw.

One species that is being hunted less frequently today is polar bears, of which just 20,000 survive in the wild. The US banned the import of polar bear trophies in 2008 and the number hunted each year in Canada fell from 360 to 210, although the two countries have continued to clash over the issue.

The Ifaw report is based on records from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), the legal treaty agreed by 182 nations, but these do not include trophies that are not exported. The Ifaw analysis is in line with previous research: in February, the Humane Society International estimated that 1.2m animal trophies were imported into the US alone over the last decade.

Ifaw found the biggest sources of trophy animals were Canada (35%), due to the many black bears killed, followed by South Africa (23%) and Namibia (11%).

After the US, hunters from Germany and Spain take the most animal trophies home, with about 10,000 entering each country over the last decade. The UK imported less than 500 over the same period, but Mansbridge is still calling on its government to follow France and other countries and ban the practice.

Mansbridge added: “It could be argued that the concept of trophy hunting as we know it today was invented by the British empire during Victorian times.

The gharial (gavialis gangeticus) is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. Since the late 1970s, efforts have been on in the country to conserve and rehabilitate this critically endangered fish-eating crocodile.

T he gharial is a resident of the fresh waters of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. However, its numbers in the river Ganga began to decrease sometime in the mid 1970s. A census was conducted and it was found that only 300 gharials were remaining in north Indian rivers.

In 1978, the Kukrail Gharial Rehabilitation Centre was established to protect the endangered gharials of the north Indian rivers.

“Gharial’s are fresh water animals. They mainly feed on fish and are very sensitive to pollution in the waters. They are unique crocodiles, as they are the only species of the order crocodilia, in which the male carries a distinctive boss at the tip of his long, thin snout, which looks like an upturned pot. This bulbous nasal protuberance at the tip of the snout develops when the animal reaches sexual maturity, which is usually at the age of 10,” says Renu Singh, Conservator of Forests, Endangered Species Project, Lucknow. The nasal protuberance of this crocodile resembles a pot (ghara in Hindi), hence the name gharial.

The Kukrail Gharial Rehabilitation Centre near Lucknow was established mainly to help recover the dwindling population of gharials in north India. However, rescued marsh crocodiles (crocodylus palustris) from the local areas have also been given sanctuary in this facility. They are kept here until ready to be released into one of the many nearby rivers.

A major soft shell turtle conservation project was also conducted at this facility, as part of the Ganga Action Plan. In association with Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA), the Centre has been involved in developing broad based inclusive colonies of all endangered turtles. Moreover, since this facility is mainly for scientific research and study, visitors are not permitted to enter and see many of the enclosures located in the core.

Gharials mate in the month of February. After a gestation period of about a month, the female digs up several trial nests to disorient predators and inside one of the many nests she lays anywhere between 10-97 eggs. Despite this, due to depredation, 90% of the eggs do not survive in the wild. At the Centre, eggs are brought in from natural nests and incubated, at around 30-35 degrees Celsius.

The sex of this species is most likely dependent on temperature during incubation. Male hatchlings are born when the temperature is higher than the threshold. Eggs hatch after 60 or 65 days.

“In the initial years at the sanctuary, eggs were picked up from natural nests built along the Chambal river. These eggs had to be carefully picked up and placed in wooden boxes, in the same position as they were found, along with the sand from the natural nests. The eggs were hatched in the artificial hatcheries and the three year old juveniles were tagged and released into the rivers,” continues Renu Singh.

Ever since then, there have always been four females and two male gharials at the Centre – they have parented many batches of young ones. To date, 5,410 gharial juveniles have been released into various rivers, of which 254 have been released into the Ganga alone.

The gharials are released after they are three years old, when they are less vulnerable to predation.

Gharials have also been sent to various zoos and nature parks across the world. Odisha, Kanpur, Delhi, West Bengal, Chennai, Bhutan, Tokyo, New York, Pakistan, and Afghanistan are some of the places where healthy gharials from the Kukrail Centre can be seen.

The Centre uses methods like ‘bio-logging’ to understand the underwater behaviour and natural habitats of free ranging gharials. Bio-logging is done with a light weight camera fitted onto the head of the animal before it is released into the river; it detaches on its own after four hours. Since it is difficult to keep a close watch on these reptiles once they are released into the wild, this camera provides information for deeper study. The camera can record diving depths, swimming speeds and frequent movements.

“For the past three years, juvenile gharials are being released with colour coded plastic cattle tags, tagged onto their tails. They have numbers etched on the tags for individual identification. When the reptiles bask in the sunshine, they can be seen easily and with the help of binoculars and very often the numbers on the tags can be seen too. In 2014, ten animals were released with high frequency (VHF) radio tags into the Ghaghra river – we still receive radio signals from four of them,” says Dr Shailendra Singh, the Program Director of Turtle Survival Alliance, India.

These methods help study the rate of survival of animals released into the wild and also their dispersal patterns from the area they have been released from.

Much has been done and much more needs to be accomplished to learn more about these fascinating creatures. It is heartening to know that a periodical census of gharials in the Chambal river has shown a stable population of 1250+ for the past couple of years. The National Geographic Society has rated the Kukrail Gharial Rehabilitation Centre as one of the most successful conservation projects in India.

On a sand strip amidst the river, resting calmly as only they can, a gharial came into view. “A huge one!” I exclaimed. “Not even fully grown,” the boatman chided me, as he cut the engine and deftly anchored along an island he knows like the back of his hand. Following a path used by nesting gharials, he showed me a couple of nests. Gharial hatchlings scrambled into the shallow waters. Only a small percentage, if any at all, would make it to maturity, but at least they were successfully hatching at one of the few gharial breeding habitats globally — the Girwa river in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh.

Gharials (Gavialis gangeticus), freshwater fish-eating crocodiles endemic to the Indian subcontinent, can reach a stupendous length of 7m, with a long snout that ends ghara (pot)-like in the male, giving it its name. Cold-blooded, they can live up to 50-60 years. Unfortunately, they are critically endangered and number around just 750 – 1,000 adults globally, with 95 per cent in India and the rest in Nepal. In addition to the Girwa river, their confirmed breeding habitats till recently had been along the course of the Chambal, Narayani (Chitwan in Nepal) and Ramganga (Corbett) rivers. Other rivers like the Ghagra, Mahanadi, Son and Ken have either lost their gharials or have small non-breeding populations.

The gharial remains highly susceptible and people are wary of its size. In India, there is significant amount of human-crocodile conflict, and many mistake the gharial as the more dangerous mugger. In December 2007, over 110 carcasses of sub and young adults were reported in the Chambal river, which harbours about 80 per cent of the global gharial population. No conclusive cause was established, though poisoning was suspected.

The arrival of a few hatchlings on World Environment Day (June 5) this year along the river Gandak in Bihar, therefore, could only mean good news for the species and its conservationists — it confirmed a new breeding population for the gharial. “The Gandak’s force was such that we would hear its roar over and above all the sounds of this land,” said boatman Rajendra Sahni, while showing us Gangetic dolphins at the confluence of the Gandak and Ganga at Patna. Known as Narayani in Nepal, the Gandak enters India to get the protection of the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar for 45 km and the Sohagibarwa Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh for 7-8 km along its left and right bank respectively. Limited agriculture, few villages on its banks (as the river is prone to eroding its banks), no major towns, network of many small channels separated by vast mid-channel islands and low fishing pressure all provide a less-disturbed habitat for gharials here.

Dr BC Choudhury, senior advisor to Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), said, “Confirmation of a new breeding site is very significant.” In the late 1960s, a barrage across the river at Valmiki Nagar had destroyed gharial habitats downstream. The region had long suffered a law and order situation, which was somewhat brought under control around 2007-08. “During that period, gharials might have been killed, but there’s no data. Over time, the river geomorphology also got modified, probably favouring the gharials,” said Samir Sinha, head of the Gharial Conservation Project, WTI. During his time at the Valmiki Tiger Reserve, where he has worked since 2003, Sinha saw seven-eight gharials basking in the distance, along the Nepal side of the river. Enquiries in 2008 by gharial expert, late Dhruvjyoti Basu, bolstered Sinha’s sightings and triggered a survey in January 2010, which recorded a remnant population of gharials in the Gandak. An elaborate habitat assessment was undertaken in 2012 at the personal interest of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. Based on expert recommendations, release sites were determined along a 50-60 km stretch, and in 2014, restocking of gharials from the captive-born stock at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, Patna, was started by WTI as part of a Bihar forest department-funded project.

The released animals were tagged with VHF and satellite transmitters. Monitoring revealed that captive-bred gharials avoided the main current and stayed in groups as in captivity and dispersed after seven-eight days. Even after years of captivity, they were able to identify suitable natural habitat and used areas frequented by wild gharials. “It was heartwarming to see released and wild gharials basking together. After seven-eight months, one moved over 1,000 km to enter the Mahananda” said Sinha.

The two-year-old project has already paid rich dividends. A March 2015 survey showed that the Gandak harboured 54 gharials, including 26 adults. With the recent arrivals, the numbers are likely to rise.

Saving the gharial is no meagre challenge. Recent news that the Gandak will be developed as an inland waterway is a grave potential threat. There is no forest department equivalent for rivers and river governance structures are lacking. Along protected areas, WTI works with forest staff, trains them and suggests critical stretches to be monitored and actions to be enforced. Working with the Water Resources department, which operates the barrage across the Gandak, is important, as a minimum flow of water is required for gharials. In an email, Dr Jeffrey Lang of the Gharial Ecology Project, India, said, “The gharial in the Chambal, which hosts 80 per cent of the global population, is facing numerous threats, industrial scale mining is one of them.” Though sand mining is not yet a major problem along the Gandak river, the Mines and Geology department is another important stakeholder.

The other important stakeholder is the local community. “On the river, we discuss the threats with our boatmen, fishers and farmers and they give us important past information. You could say, they have become brand ambassadors for the gharials,” said Sinha. Gharial mothers compete for sand banks with other wildlife, livestock and the river. Nests are often dug up by jackals and cattle hoofs sinking into nests destroy eggs. Pegs around the nest blocked off cattle and a mesh embedded within the sand warded off jackals. These protection measures were removed when it was time for the hatchlings to emerge.

Mukundan Prasad, a farmer based near Ratwal ghat, said, “Last year, we saw gharial hatchlings downstream, but did not have any idea about nesting sites. This year, we worked with the gharial team and located the nests very close to our crop fields. Due to constant vigil, the nests were saved from erosion and depredation by jackals.”

A community managed in situ hatchery for gharials and turtles will help the villagers earn and establish bonds with the species. Choudhury, an old hand at crocodile work, said, “We plan to cover the entire Gandak, most of it outside protected areas. Involving Gandak communities in a sustained manner means a better future of the species. Only by working systematically and in a sustained manner with such multiple stakeholders can we secure the future of the gharial,” he said.

Conservation, however, is a long term commitment. Rigorous future-oriented planning processes need to ensure space for multiple stakeholders in the management regime and factor in the assumption that there will be some disturbance. WTI is committed to continue till the time that gharials are well established and the state functionaries capable of managing on their own. In a telephonic conversation, US Jha, chief wildlife warden, Bihar, mentioned, “A new project to strengthen gharial conservation, including setting up a gharial centre at Valmiki Nagar, is near finalisation. Bihar is committed to the long-term conservation of the gharial and is taking steps in that direction.”

The last two years have given Sinha and his team many priceless moments, among them, “a gharial nest at just 100 m from our tent; the first released animal entering the Gandak after nine years in captivity.” But the sight that he holds dearest is “a gharial hatchling emerging from its egg.”

A fossil that has been in the collection of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History since it was discovered in 1951 is today helping scientists piece together the evolutionary history of whales and dolphins, including the origins of the endangered South Asian river dolphin.

According to Nicholas D. Pyenson, the museum’s curator of fossil marine mammals, and Alexandra Boersma, a researcher in his lab, the fossil belonged to a dolphin that swam in subarctic marine waters around 25 million years ago. It represents a new genus and species, which Pyenson and Boersma have named Arktocara yakataga.

The researchers reported their findings Aug. 16 in the journal PeerJ. They have also produced a digital three-dimensional model of the fossil that can be explored.

The fossil, a partial skull about 9 inches long, was discovered in southeastern Alaska by Donald J. Miller, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey. It then spent decades in the Smithsonian’s collection. With more than 40 million specimens in the museum’s Department of Paleobiology, “We are always learning new things about the vast legacy built by our predecessors at the museum,” Pyenson said. But earlier this year, he and Boersma were captivated by and focused their attention on what Boersma calls “this beautiful little skull from Alaska.”

By studying the skull and comparing it to those of other dolphins, both living and extinct, Boersma determined that A. yakataga is a relative of the South Asian river dolphinPlatanista, which is the sole surviving species of a once large and diverse group of dolphins. The skull, which is among the oldest fossils ever found from that group, called Platanistoidea, confirms that Platanista belongs to one of the oldest lineages of toothed whales still alive today.

The South Asian river dolphin—a species that includes both the Ganges river dolphin and the Indus river dolphin—is of great interest to scientists. It is an unusual creature that swims on its side, cannot see and uses echolocation to navigate murky rivers in Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Unlike its known ancestors, it lives only in fresh water. But human activities, including the use of fishing nets, pollution and disruption of its habitat, have decimated the species to only a few thousand remaining individuals. The group’s endangered status makes the dolphins difficult to study.

“One of the most useful ways we can study Platanista is by studying its evolutionary history, by looking at fossils that are related to it to try to get a better sense of where it’s coming from,” Boersma said. “Exactly how that once diverse and globally widespread group dwindled down to a single species in Southeast Asia is still somewhat a mystery, but every little piece that we can slot into the story helps.”

Based on the age of nearby rocks, the scientists estimate that the Arktocara fossil comes from the late Oligocene epoch, around the time ancient whales diversified into two groups—baleen whales (mysticetes) and toothed whales (odontocetes).

“It’s the beginning of the lineages that lead toward the whales that we see today,” Boersma said. “Knowing more about this fossil means that we know more about how that divergence happened.”

Fossils from Platanista’s now extinct relatives have been found in marine deposits around the world, but the Arktocara fossil is the northernmost find to date. The name of the new species highlights its northern habitat: Arktocara is derived from the Latin for “the face of the north,” while yakataga is the indigenous Tlingit people’s name for the region where the fossil was found.

“Considering the only living dolphin in this group is restricted to freshwater systems in Southeast Asia, to find a relative that was all the way up in Alaska 25 million years ago was kind of mind-boggling,” Boersma said.

Pyenson notes that some conservation biologists argue that the South Asian river dolphin should be prioritized for protection to preserve its evolutionary heritage. “Some species are literally the last of a very long lineage,” he said. “If you care about evolution, that is one basis for saying we ought to care more about the fate of Platanista.”

0,"Several Indian experts have expressed disbelief at how Bangladesh government even approved the coal-based Rampal power plant in the first place, saying such a project near a vulnerable environment site like the Sundarbans would have been shot down in India at the first instance. Talking to the Bangla Tribune recently, Indian environment specialists and rights activists said that no matter what the government in both countries claim, the construction of the 1,320MW Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant in Bagerhat's Rampal would surely have dire consequences on the Sundarbans. They also said it was incomprehensible why the NTPC Limited – India's largest thermal power agency – was building a plant near a mangrove forest in Bangladesh when it had never done so near any mangrove forest in India. One of the vocal opponents of the project is the chairman of West Bengal Pollution Control Board, Dr Kalyan Rudra, who said: “There is no precedence – not in West Bengal or India – of constructing a thermal power plant so close to a reserved forest. “According to a list of India's central Environment Ministry, this thermal power plant falls under the 'red category industry' – meaning this industry is extremely dangerous for environment. This [plant] produces both effluent and emission. So there cannot even be a question of setting up such a plant near a reserved forest.” Dr Rudra also cautioned about the potential for river pollution caused by the Rampal plant. “Around two years ago, monsoon waters washed away ashes produced by West Bengal's Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station. From an ash pond, the material was carried to the nearby Chandrabhaga River. “In accordance with a directive from India's National Green Tribunal, we carried tests on the river and found that the level of pollution had reached such an extent that there was no existence of biodiversity in a 30km area of the Chandrabhaga River. The waste ashes from the thermal power plant had killed off all fishes, insects, algae, crabs of the river,” Dr Rudra said. There are now plans to use the Pashur River for transporting coal to the Rampal plant and bringing out waste produce from it; so there remains a considerable risk for the wildlife – including the endangered Ganges Dolphin. Indian environmentalists also expressed their worries about the fate of the Bengal Tigers that are native to the Sundarbans. Gauri Maulekhi, a trustee for the animal rights organisation People For Animals, said she had no doubt that the activities of the Rampal thermal power plant would destroy the natural habitat of tigers in the Sundarbans. It was impossible to prevent pollution at a place so close to a thermal power plant, she said. “Several years ago, when the Kalagarh Dam was built in India’s Uttarakhand state, many tigers in Jim Corbett National Park had to be uprooted from their homes. But that was a hydro power plant which causes far less pollution. I fear that building a thermal power plant so close to the Sundarbans would be a danger signal for many Bengal Tigers,” she said. “One of the biggest causes for concern is that coal, which has dangerous polluting effects, will be used as fuel for Rampal. It is shocking for many Indian environmentalists and activists that how in 2016 – when the world is becoming more vocal against the use of coal – Bangladesh is choosing to use coal for power production; even more, doing it so close to the Sundarbans,” Maulekhi added. KC Ayappa, a long-time activist with Greenpeace who has done extensive research on the harmful effects of coal pollution, said: “The Sundarbans is an extremely vulnerable terrain. It gives me shivers just to think that a coal-based thermal power plant is being built so close to it.” He pointed out that different researches have shown that coal-based or nuclear power plants were capable of causing far more damage than other sustainable power generation sources like wind turbines. “Considering the risk for wildlife, thermal power plants are undoubtedly at the top of the danger list,” Ayappa said. Despite all the warnings and protests, India’s NTPC Ltd continues to insist that the Rampal project would have almost no impact on the Sundarbans. An NTPC spokesperson declined to make any comments on this issue, but said the project’s environmental impact report shows how authorities were using the most modern methods and proceeding with caution to protect the environment. The Bangladesh-India Friendship Power Company Limited, a 50-50 joint venture between Bangladesh Power Development Board and India’s National Thermal Power Corporation, is building the 1,320MW coal-fired power plant near the Sundarbans, the world’s largest mangrove forest. Demanding that the plant be shifted from the current location, local and international green activists have long been opposing the construction of the project, fearing that it would harm the Sundarbans, the Pashur River and the nearby areas in the long run.",'A power plant like Rampal would never be allowed in India',https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vdW5jYXRlZ29yaXplZC8yMDE2LzA4LzIzL3Bvd2VyLXBsYW50LWxpa2UtcmFtcGFsLW5ldmVyLWFsbG93ZWQtaW5kaWHSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2016/08/Rampal-2.jpg,2016-08-23,"{'sent': 'Several Indian experts have expressed disbelief at how Bangladesh government even approved the coal-based Rampal power plant in the first place, saying such a project near a vulnerable environment site like the Sundarbans would have been shot down in India at the first instance.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Bangladesh'], 'PERSON': ['Rampal'], 'GPE': ['India']}}",Tiger
0,"The much anticipated results of the largest ever continent-wide wildlife survey, the Great Elephant Census, will be released tomorrow at the World Conservation Congress in Hawaii. The worrying finding: Africa now has 352,271 savanna elephants left in 93 percent of the species’ range.

The aerial survey covered 18 African countries. In 15 of those, where information on previous populations existed, 144,000 elephants were lost to ivory poaching and habitat destruction in less than a decade.

The current yearly loss—overwhelmingly from poaching—is estimated at 8 percent. That’s about 27,000 elephants slaughtered year after year.

Forest elephants, which live in central and West Africa, were excluded from the census because they’re nearly impossible to spot from the air. But a 2012 ground study indicates that these elephants too are highly threatened by poaching and habitat loss.

The census was funded by Microsoft founder Paul G. Allen and took just under three years to complete. Led by the nonprofit Elephants Without Borders, which is based in Botswana, the survey involved a team of 90 scientists, six NGOs, and two advisory partners: the Kenya-based conservation organization Save the Elephants and the African Elephant Specialist Group, made up of experts who focus on the conservation and management of African elephants.

The survey’s results, published in the journal PeerJ, couldn’t have come at a more important time.

Later this month elephants will be high on the agenda at the triennial meeting in Johannesburg, South Africa, of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the body that regulates international trade in certain threatened animal species. With poaching at such dire levels, the conference may be pivotal in setting a new direction for elephants.

“I’m a big believer in the power of data to help inform decisions,” Paul Allen told National Geographic. “We have to make faster, smarter, better decisions about how and where we direct limited resources.” Allen says he’s already begun planning a ground-based survey of Africa’s forest elephants.

The Great Elephant Census is the most advanced and thorough assessment of elephant numbers ever. It was carried out by spotters in low-flying planes who peered out of either side of their planes to count the elephants below. Crisscrossing vast swaths of sub-Saharan Africa, they racked up a combined flying distance of 285,000 miles—the equivalent distance to the moon and a quarter of the way back.

REALTED: Elephants 101

Previous pan-African elephant surveys have been fairly crude. In 1969 Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a veteran conservationist and founder of Save the Elephants, undertook the earliest attempt at a continent-wide census using aerial counts and questionnaires. That survey estimated 1.3 million elephants, a disputed figure in conservation circles. A decade later experts suggested that the figure was about 600,000, highlighting a poaching crisis. Since then the exact trajectory of elephant numbers has been in question.

“For too long now, we’ve said that we don’t have precise, reliable estimates—that they’re speculative, they’re guess work,” says Mike Chase, the principal researcher for the census and the founder of Elephants Without Borders. The time for pleading ignorance about elephant numbers is over, he says. “We’re now armed with the most robust and accurate scientific data in history to give these animals a second chance.”

State of the Elephant Explore a country-by-country look at the population status of the African savanna elephant. The Great Elephant Census surveyed sites throughout the continent in 2014 and 2015. During this period, Chad had the steepest decline, followed by Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Tanzania. MALI The census team estimates that there might be fewer than 253 savanna elephants remaining in the study site. Without intervention, this small population could go extinct. BURKINA FASO, BENIN, NIGER Since 2003, the savanna elephant population in the W-Arly-Pendjari park complex has doubled to an estimated 8,911 individuals. CHAD After significant declines, the savanna elephant population in Zakouma National Park has been stable since 2010. However, elephant numbers in the Binder-Léré Faunal Reserve have declined by 44 percent over a four-year period. The census estimates a population of 743 savanna elephants in study sites in Chad. CAMEROON The census estimates that only 148 savanna elephants remain in the northern Cameroon study site. Without intervention, this rapidly declining population could go extinct. DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO Since 2010, study sites in the northeast corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo experienced the second fastest population declines (behind Mozambique) of any country. The census estimates that 1,959 savanna elephants remain in the region. UGANDA The census estimates that a population of 4,864 savanna elephants exists in study sites in Uganda, a significant improvement over the estimated 800 elephants that resided in the country during the height of poaching in the 1970s and 1980s. KENYA The country has a relatively stable elephant population, and the census estimates that there are 25,959 savanna elephants in study sites in the country. ANGOLA The census estimates that there are 3,395 savanna elephants in study sites in southeast Angola. Savanna elephant populations in the Luengue-Luiana National Park have declined by 22 percent since 2005. ZAMBIA The census recorded significant savanna elephant-population declines for study sites along the Zambezi and Kwando Rivers. However, larger populations elsewhere in Zambia had stable populations, with an estimated total of 21,758 elephants in study sites in the country. TANZANIA The census estimates that there are 42,871 savanna elephants in several study sites in Tanzania. Savanna elephant populations in the country have rapidly declined by 60 percent in the last five years. MALAWI The census estimates that there are 817 elephants in study sites in Malawi. BOTSWANA The census estimates that there are 130,451 savanna elephants in study sites in Botswana. In recent years, elephant populations in Botswana decreased slightly. ZIMBABWE The census estimates a population of 82,304 savanna elephants in study sites in Zimbabwe. Since 2005, populations have declined by 11 percent. Northwestern Zimbabwe experienced a decline of 74 percent. MOZAMBIQUE The savanna elephant population in Mozambique rapidly declined by 53 percent in five years. The census estimates that there are 9,605 savanna elephants in surveyed study sites.

The Great Elephant Census surveyed approximately 93 percent of all savanna elephants in study sites in these countries.

SOME HISTORIC-TREND DATA BASED ON AREAS SMALLER THAN CENSUS STUDY SITES.

Paula Kahumbu, a Kenyan elephant ecologist and CEO of WildlifeDirect, a Nairobi-based conservation organization, believes that by providing an independent and scientifically robust assessment of elephants, the census will carry huge weight at the CITES conference. “Proposals will be considered on the basis of scientific fact,” Kahumbu says. “It’s vital that we have accurate data to inform policy.”

Crisis by the Numbers

While the overall elephant picture is bleak, it varies greatly from country to country and from ecosystem to ecosystem.

The countries with the greatest declines were Tanzania and Mozambique, with a combined loss of 73,000 elephants to poaching in just five years. Another shocking discovery was made in northern Cameroon, where survey teams could count no more than 148 elephants—along with many carcasses—revealing a tiny regional population in immediate danger of extinction.

By contrast South Africa, Uganda, parts of Malawi and Kenya, and the W-Arli-Pendjari conservation complex—the only area in West Africa with significant numbers of savanna elephants—were found to have stable or slightly growing herds.

Botswana remains the continent’s elephant stronghold, with 130,000 animals, concentrated along the Chobe and Savuti river systems in the north and in the vast wetland oasis of the Okavango Delta.

Zimbabwe showed the second highest number of elephants—83,000—mostly along the Zambezi River and in Hwange National Park. Overall, Zimbabwe’s population has dropped 10 percent since 2005.

Zambia recorded 20,839 elephants, an 11 percent decline during the past decade. But a regional population in the southwestern corner of the country has been terribly affected by poaching: The spotters tallied just 48 elephants in Sioma Ngwezi National Park, down from 900 in 2004. At the current poaching rate, this local population also faces imminent extirpation.

View Images The bodies of elephants killed by poachers are left behind in Bouba Ndjidah National Park, in Cameroon. Researchers for the Great Elephant Census found only 148 elephants in the entire country. Photograph by Brent Stirton, Nat Geo Image Collection

Angola too gave a shock. Once hoped to be a refuge for elephants after decades of civil war, it now has one of the highest poaching rates on the continent—leading to a 22 percent drop in elephant numbers since 2005.

Namibia was the only country with a significant elephant population that opted not to participate in the census. Wide-ranging surveys conducted there in 2015 yielded an estimate of nearly 23,000 elephants.

The spotters weren’t on the lookout only for live elephants. They also counted dead animals, because carcass numbers show the extent to which poaching and natural deaths contribute to declines.

By calculating carcass ratios—the percentage of dead elephants versus live elephants observed during the survey—the researchers could get a good idea of the health of a population. A ratio above 8 percent generally means a population is declining, and continent-wide the carcass ratio turned out to be nearly 12 percent.

What’s abundantly clear, Chase says, “is that the elephant poaching crisis has moved from East and central Africa and is now on our doorstep in southern Africa. You just need to look at southwest Zambia and southeast Angola, which have the worst rates of elephant poaching on the entire continent. And when elephants are removed from those systems, poachers will look to the stronghold of northern Botswana.”

Chase says the overall message of the survey is clear. Poaching is so intense “that in 10 years' time we could lose 50 percent of Africa’s remaining elephants.”

In the Hands of Governments

For more than a century, the ivory trade has been the fire that has fueled the killing of elephants. In 1989 CITES put in place a global ban on ivory trading that significantly stemmed poaching at first. But twice since then, in 1999 and 2008, some southern African countries were allowed to sell ivory from their stockpiles—sales widely believed to have boosted ivory demand in Asia and spurred poaching and ivory smuggling.

This year, two countries—Zimbabwe and Namibia—have put forward proposals to CITES to begin a legal and regulated trade in ivory. In reaction, 26 African nations with elephant populations, supported by other countries and numerous NGOs, have submitted a proposal to halt any trade in elephants and their products.

“No nation is an island,” says Phyllis Lee, of the University of Stirling, one of the authors of the proposal. Elephants don’t stick to political borders, she says, and some populations are shared by three or four countries at a time. Decisions made about elephants in one country can have huge repercussions on poaching in other countries.

Whatever comes of the wildlife trade meeting in Johannesburg this month, for the first time CITES and African countries that have elephants will have concrete information to determine the future conservation and management of elephants.

As Chase puts it, “We now have the first baseline for assessing whether we’re going to be successful, or if we’re going to fail the African elephant.”","African Elephant Numbers Plummet 30 Percent, Great Elephant Census Finds",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE2LzA4L3dpbGRsaWZlLWFmcmljYW4tZWxlcGhhbnRzLXBvcHVsYXRpb24tZGVjcmVhc2UtZ3JlYXQtZWxlcGhhbnQtY2Vuc3VzL9IBjAFodHRwczovL2FwaS5uYXRpb25hbGdlb2dyYXBoaWMuY29tL2Rpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi9wdWJsaWMvYW1wL25ld3MvMjAxNi8wOC93aWxkbGlmZS1hZnJpY2FuLWVsZXBoYW50cy1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWRlY3JlYXNlLWdyZWF0LWVsZXBoYW50LWNlbnN1cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2016/08/31/elephant_census/01_elephant_survey.ngsversion.1472679010177.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2016-08-31,"{'sent': 'The much anticipated results of the largest ever continent-wide wildlife survey, the Great Elephant Census, will be released tomorrow at the World Conservation Congress in Hawaii.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Great Elephant Census', 'the World Conservation Congress'], 'GPE': ['Hawaii']}}",Elephant

0,"On Saturday, the international community will meet in South Africa to decide the future of elephant conservation, with an international ban on sales of ivory poised to expire next year.

There are some who argue that, like the war on drugs, the war on poaching has failed. A block of southern African countries, where elephant populations are currently thriving, argue that ending the blanket ban would allow them to put the money raised into conservation.

Elephant poaching remains a thriving industry, with one animal slaughtered for its tusks every 15 minutes, and the crisis has only worsened in recent years despite a ban on trade that has been in place since 1989.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

It is the opinion of the governments of Zimbabwe, Namibia and now South Africa that the ban has been an expensive and ultimately unsuccessful experiment in trying to end poaching.

They are of the view that a ban is not necessarily the best option for every country, and will argue that they have a right to sell off their national stockpiles when the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) meets for its 17th annual summit in Johannesburg on Saturday.

The EU has yet to come out in favour of a blanket ban, and may play a pivotal role in which way the vote goes.

Yet the southern African proposal is fiercely opposed by some individual western powers such as the US and UK.

Speaking to The Independent, Paul Gathitu of the Kenya Wildlife Service said there was a fundamental flaw to the argument, put forward in southern Africa, that stockpiles of ivory taken from elephants who died naturally – and seized from poachers – can be sold to help the living herds.

“The moment you start selling, you are placing a value on that ivory,” he said. “And if you give a little bit of ivory this year, they will want more next year.

“Our argument has been that you put it beyond economic use, you remove the value that you are placing on it. And the idea that you sell it now and put the money back into conservation – it is never enough. The one-off sale really doesn’t add much, and you can see the impact straight away on the black market.”

On Thursday, Prince William will speak on the issue of the ivory trade in his capacity as royal patron of the UK charity Tusk.

He will be joined at an address in the Shard in London by Andrea Leadsom, the environment secretary, and together they will highlight the 33,000 African elephants slaughtered each year, out of a continent-wide population of 400,000 to 630,000.

The Duke of Cambridge will highlight the results of the Great Elephant Census, published earlier this month, which showed a decline of 30 per cent in African savannah elephant populations in the space of just seven years to 2014.

And he will argue that domestic markets, such as the UK’s in pre-1947 ivory, can mask illegal trade, reinforce the value of ivory and create demand for more ivory on an international scale.

The Government is reported to be considering plans to clamp down on the domestic ivory trade, forcing dealers to provide authenticated documents that show items are more than 70 years old.

Back in Kenya there is a growing population of 35,000 elephants, which Mr Gathitu said had only been maintained thanks to strict anti-poaching legislation and a commitment of resources spanning government agencies. In neighbouring Tanzania, he says, the latest analyses suggest elephant numbers are badly down.

And Mr Gathitu said even just the talk of lifting the ban had resulted in an increase in poaching activity, because “they are trying to collect as much ivory as possible in preparation for next year”.

Botswana, home to the world's largest population of elephants, has traditionally argued against the destruction of ivory stockpiles. Last year it transformed much of its stock into a life-size elephant sculpture, placed in the main hall at Gaborone international airport as a tribute “not about the tusks, but about the elephant”.

Yet Botswana has broken ranks with its southern African neighbours, by arguing at the Cites summit that restrictions on the trade must be maintained.

Asked in a Reuters interview on Wednesday if he would support the Namibian and Zimbabwean proposals for sales to be allowed, Botswana's President Seretse Khama said: “We’re opposed to that... We need to keep elephants on Appendix I [the highest level of protection] so that there’s no trade in ivory.”

Charlie Mayhew, CEO and co-founder of Tusk, told The Independent ahead of Saturday’s summit that the charity’s position “has always been clear and simple”.

“We strongly believe that the international ivory ban has to remain in place indefinitely, and that any moves towards the potential reopening of trade in the future must therefore be blocked, as these would stimulate further poaching and hasten the elephant’s demise.

“We believe that an unambiguous message should be communicated to the world that elephants are globally protected and that buying ivory is no longer socially acceptable.”",World powers to decide fate of African elephant as global ban on ivory expires,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiECfzt09NNfsXpoxMNQORAjYqFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCtyxU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/05/03/14/kenya-ivory.jpg,2016-09-21,"{'sent': 'On Saturday, the international community will meet in South Africa to decide the future of elephant conservation, with an international ban on sales of ivory poised to expire next year.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['South Africa']}}",Elephant
0,"Endangered Amur tigers and Amur leopards are staging a modest recovery in China’s remote northeastern provinces. Over thirty tigers and some 42 leopards now roam the region’s forests.

The big cats’ habitat remains threatened by human encroachment and experts say the amount of forest currently protected is insufficient to support their growing populations.

The government of Jilin Province, where most of the big cats live, has proposed a massive new national park focused on the two species that would connect three existing protected areas.

The park remains under consideration by the central government.

It is rare to spot an Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the wild, according to Yang Jun, director of the Hunchun Forestry Bureau’s wildlife protection department. However, on July 19, residents of Machuanzi, a village merely 10 kilometers away from downtown Hunchun in China’s northeastern Jilin Province, informed him that a tiger came to the residential area and ate two dogs on a single day.

Yang went to the village immediately after he heard the news and saw footprints of the tiger and blood stains of its prey just 20 to 30 meters away from a villager’s house. “We then left four foot-bound roosters on the ground near the house for the tiger,” Yang told Mongabay. “The tiger did come back and picked the roosters one by one, four consecutive times, and we took video of the whole process.”

Living inside the buffer zone of Hunchun National Nature Reserve near the border with Russia, most villagers in Machuanzi never encounter a live tiger in their lifetime due to the animal’s scarcity. The villagers set off firecrackers to scare the tiger away, but it seemed unwilling to leave the human domain, where it could easily obtain prey. Yang said the tiger, a sub-adult not yet fully capable of finding its own prey in the wild, remained in a neighboring village about four kilometers from Machuanzi and ate sheep from local’s sheepfold.

Jilin province’s Forestry Department was planning to trap the tiger and send it to a remote forest area away from the villages, Yang told Mongabay in early September. “However, so far the tiger has not yet been successfully trapped,” he added.

Revival

The Amur tiger, a subspecies of tiger also known as the Siberian tiger, is a flagship animal of the boreal forest ecosystem. The subspecies once lived throughout the Russian Far East, northeastern China, and the Korean peninsula, but its population has declined dramatically due to habitat loss and fragmentation, prey scarcity, and poaching. Since the mid eighteenth century, both China and Russia encouraged large-scale migration and development in the region, which led directly to a sharp decline in Amur tigers from more than 3,000 in the late nineteenth century to fewer than 600 in recent decades. The IUCN lists it as endangered.

Between the 1950s and the 1990s, northeastern China served as a major timber source for construction throughout the country, providing 658 million cubic meters of timber between 1949 and 1986, according to official statistics. Excessive land exploitation and unsustainable consumption of large tracts of virgin forest for the sake of development caused the number of Amur tigers surviving in China to dwindle to between 150 and 200 in the 1970s and further to just 16 to 18 in the late 1990s.

Thanks to the two most important forest-protection policies of the Chinese central government — its National Forest Protection Program (NFPP) and its national-level nature reserves — this dire situation started to change. The NFPP was implemented to restrict logging in 1998 in response to deforestation-caused flooding, and Jilin implemented a complete ban on commercial logging in the province in 2015. Statistics released by Jilin’s Forestry Department indicate that forest coverage reached 93.76 billion square kilometers this year, bringing the province’s forest coverage up to nearly 44 percent.

At least three national nature reserves including Hunchun, Wangqing, and Huangnihe were set up in the province around 2001, near the borders of China, Russia, and North Korea. The government established these specifically to protect Amur tigers and Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis). To maintain the integrity of the cats’ habitat, Jilin’s provincial government even canceled a highway project and rerouted a high-speed railway connecting Hunchun city to Russia’s coastal city of Vladivostok.

All these efforts are starting to pay off for the cats. “After more than a decade of conservation efforts, now the number of Amur tigers in China has seen a modest recovery” to more than 30 in total, ecologist Xie Yan from the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Zoology and founder of a conservation NGO called the Global Protected Area Friendly System told Mongabay. “Twenty-seven of them have been tracked in Jilin Province alone. The number is reliable, being obtained through years of monitoring, research, and joint efforts from different research groups and science institutions.”

Four young female tigers should step into adulthood and begin breeding in the coming years, so Chinese experts predict the tiger population will continue to increase. Furthermore, according to Jilin’s Forestry Department, a total of 42 Amur leopards have been spotted in the province. The IUCN considered the subspecies extinct in China in 2007. (The group lists the leopard (Panthera pardus) as vulnerable but has not recently assessed the Amur leopard or the other eight subspecies separately.)

Cat conflicts

In recent years, it has become clear that Hunchun city and its neighborhood function as important corridors linking cat habitats in Russia and China. However, the reality is that the tiger’s habitat is becoming increasingly fragmented and degraded due to human pressure. Hunchun National Nature Reserve, which measures some 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles), is isolated. Various human activities there, including herding, ginseng planting, wood-frog raising, and gold mining have threatened the tiger’s environment.

In addition, Ge Jianping, an ecologist with Beijing Normal University who has studied wild Amur tigers and Amur leopards for decades, told China Daily earlier this year that the number of tigers has exceeded the area’s ecological carrying capacity. According to Ge, the overcrowding could cause a population crash because of pressure on resources.

“An individual female Amur tiger’s territory amounts up to 450 square kilometers, thus a successful recovery of a viable population of 18 female tigers require a minimum of 10,000 square kilometers,” Xie said. “But the current protected area is way too small.”

The strain is starting to show in an unfortunate cycle that is detrimental to people, tigers, and their prey alike. The increasing number of cattle in Hunchun city, to over 40,000, threatens wild ungulates as they consume the same grass. And the decline of the ungulates — the tigers’ and leopards’ natural prey — in turn threatens the big cats. Now tigers are frequently attacking cattle raised by local herders. In Hunchun city alone, the average number of tiger attacks on cattle has surpassed 100 each year.

Since this May, Yin Zhaohai, who owns pastureland in Hunchun city, has lost over 20 cattle, six of them to tigers. “We cannot retaliate against tigers, which are protected animals, but the security of both the cattle and us should be considered,” Yin told Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, in mid-August.

In 2006, Jilin Province launched a program to compensate people for livestock and grain lost to wildlife. The provincial government will compensate people for 100 percent of the market value of livestock preyed on by tigers and leopards. By 2015, the government spent over 120 million yuan ($18 million) on a total of 37,000 compensation cases for wildlife damage to crops and livestock.

Yang Weihe, the Global Protected Area Friendly System’s Amur tiger project manager, told Mongabay that Jilin’s full compensation program is effective in alleviating conflict between people and big cats. “Otherwise, humans might take retaliatory action, including spraying poisons on the remains of the prey,” Yang said.

Another source of conflict is poaching. According to Xie, despite being strictly prohibited, some locals set wire-loop snares to trap wildlife, such as boar (Sus scrofa) and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) in the forests. This both reduces tigers’ prey and directly threatens tigers’ lives. According to media reports, between 2000 and 2010 at least one Amur tiger was killed by a snare, and in January 2016 another was found dead as a result of serious snare wounds on its neck.

Last winter, between September 2015 and January 2016, Hunchun National Nature Reserve cleared 8,250 wire snares within the reserve and Jilin government officers apprehended 314 poachers. Wang Aimin, director of the China program of the New York-based NGO Wildlife Conservation Society, told Mongabay in Beijing in late July that the number of wire loops remaining in the forest is still significant and poses a dire threat to the tigers.

In the opinion of ecologist Jianping, the top priority for the provincial government should be to minimize human activities, including herding and farming, in order to expand the effective habitat available to the two flagship species. He added that anti-poaching and snare clearing missions, as well as the relocation of communities from some key habitat areas, should ideally be completed before this upcoming winter, when it’s more difficult for the big cats to find prey.

“Jilin provincial government has so far made a great effort, yet due to limited financial resources, national-level support is urgently needed to sustain and enhance the conservation effect,” said Ge.

A new park

A planned Amur Tiger and Leopard National Park pilot project aims to draw more national support, both financial and technical, for the protection of the big cats. The Jilin provincial government presented the pilot project plan to the central government for approval this May and a decision is still pending. An inside source who requested anonymity told Mongabay the new national park would extend 14,600 square kilometers (5,640 square miles) to connect and include Hunchun Nature Reserve, nearby Wangqing Nature Reserve in Jilin province, and Laoyeling Nature Reserve in neighboring Heilongjiang Province. It’s a huge area, 60 percent larger than Yellowstone National Park in the U.S.

Xiao Wanjun from Jilin’s Forestry Department told Xinhua in August that the national park is expected to ease human-tiger conflicts. “Local government plans to relocate some existing communities, factories from inside the national park area, so as to avoid conflicts between wildlife and human activities,” he said.

China boasts approximately 10,000 protected areas covering about 18 percent of the country, a proportion higher than the global average. But weak management and insufficient funding are threatening most of the protected areas’ conservation efforts. To revamp the management of all of China’s protected areas, in late 2013 Chinese President Xi Jinping included the development of a true national park system into the central committee’s official plans for deeper reform. Nine pilot parks across the country were announced in June 2015.

This is a crucial moment for Chinese conservation, Yang Rui, head of Tsinghua University’s landscape architecture department and a member of a team of experts appointed by the central government to advise the national park project, told Mongabay. According to Yang, if the new national park system successfully unifies dissenting interest groups and changes the mindsets of local governments that are hungry for economic development, it may be the first step to realizing the central government’s aspiration of a truly ecological civilization.

The central government has pledged that the new national parks will be more effective in managing and protecting land and wildlife than existing protected areas are, but the concept of the new Chinese national park system remains otherwise poorly defined. Ecologists say systemic change is needed before the new national parks can successfully prioritize nature conservation while remaining an educational attraction open to the public.

“Frankly speaking, I still worry about the current national park situation when almost all attempts to build national parks in nine different provinces are still based on attracting tourists and profit,” Yang said. “If national parks are blindly built before national park reform is concretely defined, the results would be disastrous.”

During a recent interview with Mongabay, Chen Jin, Director of Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in Yunnan Province, also cautioned that in building a national parks system from scratch, the government should enact strict legal protections for the parks. Otherwise, without effective restriction by national law, short-term protections might give way to local governments’ development ambitions in the long run.

Just how the Amur Tiger and Leopard National Park will function has yet to be clarified, but experts say it would represent a significant step in protecting the charismatic cats. Ecologist Xie of the Chinese Academy of Sciences commented that building a new national park larger than 10,000 square kilometers that connects now-separated protected areas is crucially meaningful for Amur tiger and leopard conservation. She emphasized the importance of community protection efforts, pointing out that it is impossible to relocate all the people who now live inside the proposed national park boundaries.

“10,000 square kilometers is merely the present necessary habitat for the tiger population, and with the revival of the tiger population, it would be likely that local communities would coexist with roaming tigers in a large area amounting to 30,000 or even up to 300,000 square kilometers in the future,” she said. “So both humans and the tiger need to learn how to live together in a peaceful way.”

According to Wang of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s China program, it is those locals who would learn the best routines and habits for living with their tiger neighbors. “It is very important for the community to make a balancing demarcation line and follow some principles to avoid direct conflicts with their neighbors,” he said. “The goal is to attain a harmonious dynamic state between the two.”",China considers a huge national park for Amur tigers and leopards,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxNi8wOS9jaGluYS1wcm9wb3Nlcy1hLWh1Z2UtbmF0aW9uYWwtcGFyay1mb3ItYW11ci10aWdlcnMtYW5kLWxlb3BhcmRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2016/09/01190556/092216_WYan_TigerConservation_Tiger-683x512.jpg,2016-09-22,"{'sent': 'Endangered Amur tigers and Amur leopards are staging a modest recovery in China’s remote northeastern provinces.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China']}}",Tiger

We know poaching is decimating the African elephant population—over 30 percent of the population were killed from 2007 to 2014 alone. But what is poaching doing to African economies? Quite a bit of damage, it turns out: A new study in the science journal Nature Communications found that elephant poaching is costing African economies $25 million a year in missed tourism revenue.

The study, conducted by scientists from the University of Cambridge, University of Vermont, and the World Wildlife Fund, explains that an uptick in poaching generally corresponds with a decrease in nature-based tourism. To come to this conclusion, the researchers aggregated the average annual tourist visits from 164 sites in “protected areas” in 25 countries over a period of time—these areas contain about 90 percent of Africa’s elephants. Then, based on data they gathered on the changes in elephant populations and rates of illegal killing in these protected areas, along with the spending levels of nature-based tourists, the researchers were able to use a regression model to predict future rates of tourism as elephant populations continued to decrease at the rate they are currently being killed. Predictably, tourist visits decreased as fewer elephants were available in the protected areas.

Engaging in more aggressive conservation methods should provide an economic incentive.

After simulating how much tourist spending would also be lost as visitation rates decreased, the researchers found a loss of $9 million from direct visitation spending, and an additional average loss of $16.4 million from indirect spending — money that would come from visiting nearby cities, staying at hotels, and the like.

This study is the first to try to calculate exactly how much revenue African countries are losing to poachers. While $25 million is a large sum, the research also shows that the lost revenue exceeds the amount of money it would cost African countries to implement better conservation methods for the elephants. Therefore, engaging in more aggressive conservation methods should provide an economic incentive.

“For example, for every dollar invested in protecting elephants in East Africa, you get about $1.78 back,” Brendan Fisher, an environmental studies professor at the University of Vermont and one of the study’s co-authors, wrote in an accompanying press release.

However, as we wrote in our last piece about elephant poaching (which is predominantly fueled by the illegal ivory market), continuing to focus legislationefforts on the victims of this equation will most likely not affect poaching rates. In fact, stricter conservation guidelines may result in an increase in poaching. With most African Savannah elephant populations already under “Appendix 1” categorization (the status given to the most at-risk animals by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), it is also unclear how many more measures can be taken to further control the elephant population.

Perhaps the best solution for elephant poaching would be to shift the attention to the people fueling the dangerous ivory market.",Poaching Isn’t Just Bad for the Elephants—It Hurts the Economy Too,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vcHNtYWcuY29tL25ld3MvcG9hY2hpbmctaXNudC1qdXN0LWJhZC1mb3ItdGhlLWVsZXBoYW50cy1pdC1odXJ0cy10aGUtZWNvbm9teS10b2_SAV1odHRwczovL3BzbWFnLmNvbS8uYW1wL25ld3MvcG9hY2hpbmctaXNudC1qdXN0LWJhZC1mb3ItdGhlLWVsZXBoYW50cy1pdC1odXJ0cy10aGUtZWNvbm9teS10b28?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://psmag.com/.image/t_share/MTQ2NTk2MjQ0Mzk3NzYyNDI3/633f8-1axfpaojvhnylmzmmcm7lcg.jpg,2016-11-01,"{'sent': 'An African elephant in Amboseli National Park, Kenya.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Kenya']}}",Elephant
0,"Encountering a peacock in the wild is a surreal experience. Just one of the sightings among a wealth of exotic and unfamiliar birds at the Uttar Pradesh Bird Festival

There was a flash of the richest blue, as the bird emerged from the forest and strutted across the path in front of us. Instantly recognisable, yet at the same time oddly unfamiliar, it lifted its neck and flicked an enormously long tail, before melting into the vegetation, never to be seen again.

Encountering a peacock in the wild, in its native India, is a surreal experience. I regularly see them in the grounds of Bath Spa University’s Corsham Court, where they strut around as if they own the place. Yet now I was watching them in the fields and forests of India’s most populous state, home to the second Uttar Pradesh Bird Festival.

The peacock – or Indian peafowl, to give the bird its correct name – wasn’t the only familiar sight and sound. Noisy flocks of rose-ringed parakeets tore across the sky like a bright green version of the Red Arrows, while we also came across a red junglefowl, the ancestor of the domestic chicken, looking for all the world like a farmyard cockerel.

Other birds were more exotic and unfamiliar. Graceful black-winged kites floated overhead, while long-tailed shrikes perched on the walls. Hume’s warblers constantly uttered their distinctive disyllabic call from the dense foliage of the trees above our tents, though these tiny birds, which migrate here from north of the Himalayas, were frustratingly tricky to see. This species was named after the Victorian bird collector and colonial administrator Allan Octavian Hume, who has been dubbed the father of Indian ornithology, and in later years also helped found the Congress Party.

Each day, after we had enjoyed talks from both Indian and foreign ornithologists, we headed out into the surrounding countryside. If it were an independent country, Uttar Pradesh would rank sixth in terms of population – behind only China, India, the United States, Indonesia and Brazil – so you might imagine that there are few places where birds can find sanctuary. Yet during our visit we collectively saw well over 200 different species.

These included one of the world’s largest birds, the stately sarus crane, whose name derives from a Hindi word meaning “bird of the lakes”; along with some of the smallest, such as the red avadavat, a tiny finch with a rich crimson plumage that perches on strands of elephant grass to feed on the seeds.

On a boat trip along the mighty Chambal River we caught up with bar-headed geese, great thick-knees – a relative of our own stone-curlew – and black-bellied terns. But for many of us, the highlight was catching sight of the critically endangered Indian gharial, a slender, long-snouted crocodilian seen basking on the mudflats.

Our final destination was Dudhwa National Park, close to India’s border with Nepal. Here we marvelled at vast flocks of waterbirds, with a dozen species of ducks, sixteen different kinds of herons, storks and ibises – including the wonderfully named intermediate egret – and a pair of Himalayan goldenbacks.

This colourful woodpecker was a species I had always wanted to see. That was not just because it is strikingly attractive, but also because before its name was shortened, it used to be the longest of any bird in the world: Himalayan golden-backed three-toed woodpecker. One to include in my current work in progress, a book on the origins of bird names…

0,"Manger has been studying sleeping animals for almost two decades. He began with, of all things, the platypus, which turned out to get more rapid eye movement (REM) sleep—the type in which dreams occur—than any other animal. From that quirky start, Manger went on to study sleeping dolphins, whales, hippos, echidnas, cats, and antelopes.

But most of that research involved captive animals, which enjoy plentiful food and an absence of predators. For those reasons, they sleep much more than their wild cousins. For example, in the 1980s, scientists found that captive three-toed sloths sleep for 16 hours a day—a result that earned them a reputation for, well, sloth. In 2008, when other researchers recorded the brain activity of wild sloths, he found that they only sleep for 10 hours a day. Manger also wanted to take the science of sleep into the wild. And he started with elephants.

As a very rough rule, and for reasons that are still unclear, bigger mammal species tend to sleep less than smaller ones. Captive elephants reportedly sleep for just 3 to 7 hours a day, but for their size, you’d expect them to get even less. Proving that is hard, though. Elephants can sleep standing up, so it’s difficult to eyeball whether they’re awake or asleep, especially if you’re tracking them through the bush at night. Brain activity sensors would give better answers, but an elephant’s anatomy makes it exceedingly risky to surgically implant such devices. So Manger and Gravett settled for the actiwatches instead. They also fitted satellite collars onto the animals to track their whereabouts later.

As Manger suspected, the two females got just over two hours of sleep a night, and even that isn’t unbroken—it occurs in four to five bursts, spread throughout the night. On most nights, they slept standing up; on some, they lay down. They weren’t fussy about their choice of sleeping spots, and the distance they traveled during the day had no effect on how long they slept.

“Under natural conditions, animals should show shorter sleep times than in the lab, where food is always available and there are no predators,” says Isabella Capellini from the University of Hull. “It's very nice that we start getting estimates of sleep outside the lab.”

Of course, Gravett and Manger only studied two elephants, and both were adult matriarchs—the individuals who bear the burden of leading the herd. It’s possible that males, youngsters, or lower-ranked females might get more shut-eye, but it’s at least clear that in this particular demographic, sleep time is superlatively low.

The gray whale is much larger than an elephant, but still sleeps for nine hours a day. A dolphin can sleep with one half of its brain at a time, allowing it to stay constantly alert for days at a stretch—but each half still gets at least four daily hours. Oddly, the next shortest sleeper seems to be the domestic horse, which gets just three hours a day, followed by the domestic pony, which gets slightly more. For now, it appears that the African savannah elephant is the shortest sleeper around. (The longest seems to be the little brown bat, which gets an incredible 19 hours a day.)",Wild Elephants Sleep Just Two Hours a Night,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiELk7xoPRkBHaS6KbiZuHQykqFggEKg0IACoGCAowm_EEMKAiMOfsywM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/gIWFyM6AFcRg45YPuHxpWZ3x7eQ=/0x252:4533x2612/960x500/media/img/mt/2017/02/RTX2RKB7/original.jpg,2017-03-01,"{'sent': 'For example, in the 1980s, scientists found that captive three-toed sloths sleep for 16 hours a day—a result that earned them a reputation for, well, sloth.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['three']}}",Elephant

CHITWAN: The population of gharials is declining rapidly despite the efforts invested by various organisations in Nepal, it has been revealed.

The reptiles released in various rivers are declining in the number, according to Assistant Conservation Officer of the Chitwan National Park, Bed Bahadur Khadka.

The Crocodile Breeding Centre was established at Kasara in Chitwan National park in 1978. The Centre along with its subsidiaries has occasionally been releasing the amphibian reptiles into the six rivers of Nepal since 1981.

Until now, 546 gharials have been released into Rapti River alone, followed by 399 in Narayani River. Likewise, 35 in Kaligandaki, 95 in Saptakoshi, 41 in Karnali, 110 in Babai have been released, Khadka informed. He said that the population of the amphibian reptiles were estimated at 150 in each Narayani and Rapti while other rivers are estimated at 50 in average.

He said that the population of the amphibian reptiles were estimated at 150 in each Narayani and Rapti rivers while other rivers are estimated at 50 in average.

A hatchling which leaves its parents in a week after hatching out of egg needs water bodies covering at least 200 kilometres to exercise.

In lack of adequate space, about 75 per cent of the reptiles cross into Indian water, but cannot return to its habitat, officer Khadka asserted.

Apart from the migration, various human activities including fisheries and extracting stones, sand and pebbles from the riverbed have been the main causes of the destruction of the habitats of the amphibian reptiles.

The census carried out in the rivers of Nepal in March-April last year had shown the increase in the number of gharial crocodiles by 74, in comparison to the census carried out in 2013, when only 124 crocodiles were found in rivers of Nepal.

Listed among the species of special concern by the WWF, it has been assumed that 50 per cent of the gharials will be extinct in ten years.

According to WWF Project Director (Bengal) Saswati Sen, the Ganges river dolphin, a national aquatic animal, is not seen during rains, and therfore they will undertake the exercise when water level comes down in the river.

""After the rains stop in October-November, we will undertake the survey along a 534 km stretch of Bengal in six-seven spots, but with a difference from previous practice, Sen told PTI.

""When we zero-in on the Namkhana-Diamond Harbour stretch, we will link two points and scan the entire area. Likewise along the Sabujdwip-Khamargachhi stretch in Hooghly district, two ends will be connected and the area surveyed,"" Sen, who was part of a team which scanned 45 spots for the previous survey earlier this year, said.

Sen said while WWF-Bengal had previously conducted such surveys mostly based on sightings, this time ""We wish to undertake the same exercise with equipment which help more accurate imaging.""

""Of the spots the team visited earlier this year, around 80 dolphins (Platanista Gangetica) were seen across a 500 km stretch and the number was less than the dolphins sighted four years back,"" Sen said.

""We talked to people living on the banks of the river during the survey and they all confirmed that fewer dolphins are sighted these days,"" the WWF official said.

Asked about the factors, Sen said siltation and river water pollution were the main reasons as dolphin poaching was not a practice in the Gangetic belt of West Bengal.

""As part of sensitisation campaign, we are raising awareness among different target groups living along the river banks - hoteliers and panchayat members - reminding them how river pollution is affecting the ecosystem chain,"" she said.

Sen said this species of dolphins are seen in the Ganga-Brahmaputra river system in India and their total estimated number is 1,600, adding that the number of Dolphins in the Ganga will be clear after the next survey.

Ganges River Dolphins, whose scientific name is Platanista gangetica, share their habitat with crocodiles, fresh water turtles and wetland birds. They prefer deep waters, in and around the confluence of two or more rivers. Loss of habitat, mainly owing to the creation of dams and irrigation projects, is one of the main threats to the species.

""We talked to people living on the banks of the river during the survey and they all confirmed that fewer dolphins are sighted these days,"" the WWF official said.

Asked about the factors, Sen said siltation and river water pollution were the main reasons as dolphin poaching was not a practice in the Gangetic belt of West Bengal.

One of the questions that fascinates children and adults alike is how do birds migrate and do they eat during their annual journeys? A fascinating study by Swedish researchers has lent insights into the “loop migration” of the common rosefinch from Sweden to India and back using different routes in autumn and spring. The rosefinch, which is observed during winters and spring in the tricity region, is a small bird of a length 13-15 cms. Researchers attached light-level geolocators on the backs of rosefinches after trapping them in Sweden. Geolocators are devices which track bird movements by accumulating time-stamped light data as the bird flies. The researchers access that data by recapturing the bird after a successful migratory journey and download the data to a computer.

The researchers, R Stach, C Kullberg, S Jakobsson, K Ström, and T Fransson found that rosefinches moved from Sweden between late July and early August towards east-southeast across Russia and Central Asia before making for Western India. The rosefinches often flew alone and at night during their epic journey. During this autumn migration, rosefinches made long stops (19 to 28 days) to take advantage of food abundance. On their way back to Sweden the following spring, the birds took routes which were more southerly as compared to autumn migration. The reason was that Central Asian deserts are extremely dry in autumn, but rain during winter makes the vegetation in the desert area flourish that allows birds to use the desert zone for stopover in spring.

The other fascinating aspect was that on their return migration, rosefinches were faster! They wanted to reach summer breeding grounds in Sweden early and be favourably placed for mate selection!

RETURN OF THE NATIVES

The UT animal husbandry and fisheries department is keeping a close watch on Sukhna lake’s fish biodiversity due to high evaporation, low rainfall and Skymet’s forecast of a below-normal monsoon. The lake had dried up in June 2012 leading to fish mortality. A number of large fish had to be taken out and rehabilitated at the Government Fish Seed Farm near the regulator-end. The falling water-level has impacted the second phase of release of 5,000 seeds of native carp species, rohu, katla and mrigal, to balance exotic carps in the lake. On July 26, 2016, the department had released 5,000 seeds of native carps in the first phase.

‘’We had planned to release 5,000 seeds of native carps in May or June this year but falling water level has led us to review the schedule. We have postponed the release to July or beyond when we expect monsoon rains to rejuvenate the lake. If the seed is released and the lake dries up, the seed will suffer high mortality. The other decision we have taken is to let recreational angling continue till June as it will enable a thinning of exotic, commercial fish and also provide feedback on the fish status at the Sukhna via the keen anglers,’’ department’s joint director Dr Kanwarjit Singh told this writer.

Explaining the logic of releasing native carps, Dr YK Rawal, assistant professor of zoology, Panjab University and member, UT Environment Impact Assessment Committee said, “The removal of big fish from the Sukhna in October 2015 revealed that exotic grass and silver carps were outnumbering indigenous carps. All over Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, exotic carps tend to dominate aquatic systems. The katla is a surface feeder, the mrigal a bottom and rohu is a column or in-between feeder. All levels of the Sukhna’s waters will be covered by the three native carps.’’

IGNORING RESEARCH

One dolphin (encircled in red) spotted on April 4, 2017, after the water flow was cut on river Beas. ( PHOTO: Punjab Forests & Wildlife Preservation department )

The drastic cut in water flow of the river Beas from 30,000 cusecs a day to 1,100 cusecs in order to allow repairs of the Harike barrage and canal gates has led to a frantic search for the endangered Indus river dolphin. The population estimate of dolphins carried out by WWF- India’s senior project officer Mohd Shahnawaz Khan established the number of these mammals between 18 and 35 in the stretch from Harike wildlife sanctuary to Beas town. However, following the substantial cut in water with effect from March 27, 2017, teams of WWF-India and wildlife department claimed to have found “four dolphins”, and released photographs of only one of these four.

The question that arises is that why no precautions were taken to safeguard dolphins when the irrigation department had provided prior intimation of the water cut? Officers and WWF-India had available Khan’s research paper published in 2016 (Factors affecting survival of Indus River Dolphin and species tolerance towards anthropogenic pressure), which clearly points out that during period of low flows, dolphins tended to migrate downstream towards the sanctuary. Khan’s research stated that “management interventions should be focused on identified havens for dolphins during low-flow seasons”.

The danger is that during the current and intense cut in Beas waters, some dolphins may have been flushed into the canals or the Sutlej downstream of the barrage. This is a danger that even gharials will face when re-introduced into the Beas (as per the latest proposal) in September 2017.

0,"A rare dolphin fossil found along Calvert Cliffs in 1997 has been fully identified. A scientific paper documenting this find and authored by Stephen J. Godfrey at the Calvert Marine Museum, Lawrence G. Barnes of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, and Olivier Lambert at the Institut Royal des Sciences Naturelles de Belgique, was published online today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

The nearly complete skull (Figure 1) was discovered by Mary Kidd along Calvert Cliffs in 16-17 million year old sediments of the early Miocene, and collected by David Bohaska and Kidd in 1997. It has been in collections at the United States National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian Institution) since that time and has recently been described and confirmed as an ancient relative of the South Asian river dolphin family, the Platanistidae. This archaic dolphin skull has been referred to the extinct species Araeodelphis natator; a scientific name with Greek origins that means “the thin swimming dolphin”; reference to its slender bony snout. With this more complete skull, we now know that the early platanistid Araeodelphis was able to echolocate, had relatively large fully functional eyes, lacked the facial crests associated with the highly specialized sonar system of the living South Asian river dolphin, and lived in the ocean.

The vast majority of dolphins are marine, but several species live exclusively in freshwater environments. The endangered South Asian river dolphin (aka the Ganges river dolphin), Platanista gangetica (Figure 2) is one of those kinds. It inhabits freshwater rivers in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. Although nearly blind, these mammals navigate the turbid waters with a very specialized form of sonar. The South Asian river dolphin has been recognized as the National Aquatic Animal of India, and it has been named as the National Mammal of Pakistan.

MULTAN: SAARC Arbitration Council (SAARCO) Director General Thusantha Wijemanna said Pakistan has a potential to attain food self-sufficiency.

He expressed these views during a visit to Taunsa Barrage Headworks where they witnessed Indus river dolphin along with his spouse on Thursday.

During his visit Thusantha was informed that Indus dolphins were one of the four species that live in freshwater and were named as the national mammal of Pakistan. He also visited an agriculture farm at head Muhammad Wala and lauded the irrigation system. Thusantha said Pakistan has a great potential to attain self-sufficiency in different sectors including food.

During a visit to a fabric factory, he appreciated the quality and standards of the products. He said SAARC countries should promote trade with each other for the prosperity of the region.

He was accompanied by Multan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Secretary General Khurram Javed and Multan Arts Council ex-director Muhammad Ali Wasti. He said SARCO was acting as a quality alternative dispute resolution forum on behalf of governments and the people of SAARC member states on its panel of arbitrators and conciliators.

Four boys go hunting for birds in the Okavango Delta. Their traps full, the 12-year-old cousins are walking home with their dinner when they spy a kettle of vultures circling ahead. For reasons they still can't explain, instead of steering clear, they walk towards them, curious, forgetting there's only one thing guaranteed to attract vultures.

The boys interrupt a pride of lions ripping apart a freshly felled buffalo. Almost too late, they recall a lesson their fathers taught them: don't run, stay still, stay silent. Stare down the lion.

The boys freeze. The lions circle. Predators and prey stay this way for hours, the boys never breaking eye contact - until the big cats scatter as a grass fire sweeps through, lit by a father who comes searching for his boys, who sees the same vultures circling and assumes the worst. ""He rescued us and took us home, and to this day we've never forgotten what our fathers taught us.""

The firepit at Sanctuary Stanley's Camp.

Kebonye Ramorusi, known to everyone as Ice, tells his story over a fireside dinner at Sanctuary Stanley's Camp deep in the delta. The dense night presses in around us, full of alarming noises and long shadows. We listen, saucer-eyed, in fear and fascination. Like most of the staff here, our guide grew up in one of the six villages within a 105,000-hectare private concession called NG32 on which the camp is located. On safari in the delta, I want to follow the man who has stared down a lion.

Ice was born the day Botswana gained its independence from Britain. In September last year the little landlocked republic of two million people celebrated 50 years of peaceful democracy. Surrounded by troubled neighbours - Zimbabwe, Namibia, South Africa and Angola - Botswana has long been regarded by the international community as ""the African miracle"". Its rare political stability and spectacular economic growth were fuelled by the discovery of the world's largest diamond reserves - fortuitously, soon after the British relinquished their protectorate, then named Bechuanaland - and overseen by Seretse Khama, a benign and beneficent president. Ice's passage from a tribal childhood to highly respected safari guide is emblematic of his nation's story.

A guest cottage at Chobe Chilwero.

Botswana is miraculous for other reasons, too. In a region notorious for trophy hunting and rampant poaching of elephants and rhino, the nation has an uncompromising shoot-to-kill policy towards poachers, and hunting of any kind is banned on public land. A third of Africa's elephants have disappeared in the past seven years, according to the findings of the Great Elephant Census released in August last year, and increasingly the remainder is seeking refuge in Botswana: 130,451 of them at last count - the biggest population of elephants in Africa.

We've come to see them, and the many other miracles of Botswana, at a trio of lodges and tented camps in the nation's north run by Sanctuary Retreats, an affiliate of the global Abercrombie & Kent travel group. Though each location and camp style is unique, the welcome at Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero lodge, our first stop, sets the pattern. A choir of staff with lovely, seldom-heard names - Ishmael, Finneas, Florence - gather for our arrival and throw their hearts into a song in melodious Setswana, while a cup of bush tea and just-baked scones wait for us. Past a pair of warthogs grazing on the front lawn, along a path scattered with basketball-sized dung heaps and the delicately veined footprints of elephants (as big as serving platters) are 15 cottages. Each has all the comforts of home plus an outdoor shower, a hammock in a courtyard at the back, and a front veranda with views across a floodplain to the mighty Chobe River, broad and brown and teeming, I imagine, with hippos and crocodiles.

Elephants at Chobe River.

Sure enough, there are floats of hippo and plenty of lantern-jawed Nile crocodiles glowering on muddy banks when we take a boat out on the Chobe late each afternoon. We sidle towards a male hippo the size of a minibus as it slides from one stinking puddle to another; our approach elicits a full 180-degree yawn, shocking in its candy-pinkness and unmistakable aggression. We move on.

Birdlife throngs in the dying day: Egyptian geese and helmeted guinea fowl, storks and spurfowl, darters and doves. Fish eagles wheel overhead, crying like babies. We glide past scimitar-horned waterbucks and a 50-strong troop of baboons, momentarily becalmed by their communal delousing exercise.

But this is Africa's Elephant Central - authorities estimate about 80,000 of the nation's 130,000 elephants live here in Chobe National Park - and they steal the show. Families shower together on the banks; the ladies - bags and wrinkles deepening in the twilight - hose each other companionably while their youngsters mock-charge and squirt each other, then roll awkwardly in the mud. Across the main channel on marshy Sedudu Island are huddles of mainly male elephants, methodically salad-spinning their dinner. We edge close to a dozen of them, ankle-deep, trunks grasping and uprooting reeds, rhythmically threshing in a scything motion to dislodge mud and insects, then popping the thatches in their mouths. Watching this mealtime routine at close quarters - close enough to cop a misting of mud, close enough to smell an elephant's herbaceous fart - is both thrilling and meditative.

Poolside at Chobe Chilwero.

It's this mix of exhilaration and intense focus that makes safaris so addictive, and there are twice-daily excursions on river and land at Chobe Chilwero. We head out at sunrise one day on a drive with Chika Kachana, a Chobe guide for 16 years; he shows us the dusty graves of his grandparents in the national park. The early birds are everywhere - flycatchers and francolins, herons and hornbills - and we're discussing the messy feeding habits of the open-bill stork when Chika stops the truck, peers down at a glossy black deposit by the track and announces, ""Lion, close.""

In the course of the next couple of hours, he tracks a pride back and forth across the park, finding signs of their erratic passage where we can see only sand and scrub. Instead, we're entranced by the persistence of a handsome cappuccino-coloured male impala who chases a wily female repeatedly around a rocky circuit - I'm not sure who to cheer when she evades him on the fifth pass. We feel the pathos in the lowing of a buffalo to her lame, exhausted calf - its limp grows worse as we watch, the distance growing between them. The ride is so packed with distractions we're no longer focused on the big cats when we finally find them: four silent assassins downwind from a waterhole full of elephants and sable antelope.

Aerial view of the Okavango Delta.

The 90-minute flight south-west from Chobe Chilwero to one of its sister retreat, Sanctuary Stanley's Camp - which takes place in a noisy single-prop plane not much bigger than an elephant - is one of the most thrilling of my life, for it's only from this vantage that the complexity, the improbable wonder of this vast delta surrounded by desert can be grasped.

From Chobe, we rise over dry stubbled plains pocked by grey soaks and bisected by a few deadstraight roads that stretch forever. Gradually, the plains become freckled by glittering ponds, then dark ribbons of water appear, winding intestinally around clots of land crowned by palms and termite hills. The ponds become lagoons and the islets multiply and become thousands of islands, and that's when we really know we're in the Okavango Delta.

For a month every summer, the Okavango River surges with rain from the Angola highlands and then spreads dramatically for the next four months across the delta, some 15,000 square kilometres of country in flux. The flood peaks between June and August, by which time the delta has swollen to triple its typical size and attracted one of the biggest and most diverse concentrations of wildlife on the planet. From this low altitude, we can clearly see animal tracks spread like capillaries across the landscape. And we see the animals, too: half-submerged hippos in green swamps, elephants walking trunk to tail, buffalo milling in dark herds.

The firepit at Sanctuary Chief's Camp.

We touch down on a little dirt airstrip and climb into an open-sided Land Cruiser for an airport transfer to top them all - in deep sand and around termite hills, through chattering thickets teeming with birds and baboons, and around a corner suddenly filled by the enormous flapping ears of a bull elephant. Before long we're fording lagoons the colour of bush tea. ""Feet up!"" cries TT our driver-guide, as the truck dives bonnet-deep and a wave sloshes under our seats.

It's a perfect introduction to the everyday adventures at Stanley's Camp, just eight stylish tents and a communal dining-lounge pavilion, unfenced, on the shore of a huge lagoon bordering Moremi Game Reserve. Most of the staff here and at the even smaller Sanctuary Baines' Camp nearby come from the villages within the concession, and these communities benefit from the camps' lease fees and best-practice land and wildlife management. There are no other camps on this concession, so it's exceedingly rare to come across any vehicles on game drives, and there's complete solitude during walks in the bush or mokoro excursions on water.

Sundowners by a lagoon.

We head out at dawn in fibreglass canoes that resemble the mokoros traditionally hollowed out by hand from tree trunks. Using long poles called ngashi, Manpower Tsile, a third-generation poler, and Sam Mephatoetsile, who learnt the skill from his father, propel their mokoros along ""hippo highways"", shallow channels cleared by the creatures. A whiff of mist sits above the reeds, gilded by the morning light, and we glide silently, slowly, the languid pace of a dream. A pair of Egyptian geese take flight in unison; ""go away!"" cries an aptly named grey go-away bird nearby. In the distance a herd of red lechwe scatters, the antelope prancing easily through knee-deep water. It's so quiet that we hear the thunder of stampeding buffalo, a herd of 500 or more, long before we see the clouds of dust they stir up on a distant island.

Mercifully, on a bushwalk next morning, we encounter no buffalo (they're virtually guaranteed to charge) and the only sign of a hippo (also murderous when surprised) is a bleached skull, gnawed around the eyes by hyenas, the two killer bottom teeth as long as an outstretched hand. A walk in the wild is not for the faint-hearted, and Ice hoists a gun over his shoulder and drills us all carefully on emergency procedure. I stick close behind him, recalling his story about the boys and the lions, and soon he's spotting a porcupine quill here, hyena tracks there, and his stories of medicinal miracles found in the bush and crazy-critter encounters flow like the delta in flood.

Sam and Manpower in mokoros.

The appearance of wild sage bushes triggers another of Ice's incredible childhood stories - about the night he was forced to shelter from a storm in an aardvark hole, and rubbed sage leaves on his body to mask his scent from predators, a common practice among traditional hunters. (The story gets better: the sage branches that the boy pulled over the hole's entrance for protection appealed to a passing lion, which spent the night sleeping above him on the cushiony shrubbery. The boy was scared witless but survived to tell the tale.)

Not all encounters with wildlife are random. In its portfolio of philanthropic projects focused on environmental and community sustainability, Sanctuary Retreats works with the Living with Elephants Foundation, which offers guests at Stanley's and Baines' camps a walk in the bush with three orphaned African elephants. For the past 28 years, Doug and Sandi Groves have lived with Morula, Jabu, and Thembi, heading into the delta with them every day to forage and roam, and walking home with them at night. As ambassadors for a species under threat throughout Africa, the elephants are irresistible and the Groves are articulate advocates for harmony between humans and elephants. Part of their work is an educational outreach project for children from local delta villages - many have grown up fearing or resenting elephants - who spend a couple of days with the Groves and their charges. As we walk hand-in-trunk with the elephants - deceptively quickly, though they look like they're dawdling - the Groves deliver an encyclopaedic overview of the habits and social life of the African savannah elephant. The most fascinating insight, though, comes from watching this unlikely mixed herd of five, as idiosyncratic as any more conventional family.

The Geoffrey Kent Suite at Chief's Camp.

A few days later, we spot the results of another of Sanctuary's conservation projects in the delta. We've flown from Stanley's Camp to Chief's Island, the biggest in the Okavango: 70 kilometres long and 15 kilometres wide, a refuge for huge numbers of creatures during the floods and regarded as one of the best wildlife-viewing locations in Africa. On our first game drive from Sanctuary Chief's Camp, we spot three white rhinos - frisky and healthy (and coloured grey rather than white, by the way). Their existence is another of the nation's miracles. By 1992, fewer than 19 white rhinos survived in the wild in Botswana and the black rhino was declared ""locally extinct"", prompting the government to take the drastic measure of relocating all surviving rhinos to fenced reserves.

In 2001, in a complex project involving government authorities, the defence force and private bodies, four white rhinos were released in Moremi Game Reserve within the delta, chosen for its lush pastures and relative inaccessibility to poachers; black rhinos were released two years later. Sanctuary Retreats joined the project in 2015, enabling the introduction of another handful of black rhinos. The results of 15 years of painstaking management and vigilance graze in front of us now, part of a healthy breeding population of white rhinos and a viable number of black rhinos in the delta.

The central pavilion at Chief's Camp.

Chief's Camp hugs the shore of a pristine lagoon filled with reeds and lilies, an oasis within this vast oasis. Rebuilt last year, it's the company's flagship property with luxuries hard to imagine on safari: a spa, a lagoon-facing pool, children's activity cottage, a gym (which makes sense, given no one can venture outside to run among predators), and cool communal pavilions styled with tribal jewellery, river-stone room dividers, beaded chandeliers and clusters of leather sofas, cowhide benches and deck-side rattan lounges.

Ten apartment-sized guest pavilions have walls lined with canvas, though they're not in the least tent-like, with indoor and outdoor living and dining areas beneath high thatched ceilings, indoor and outdoor showers, deep freestanding bathtubs, coffee machines, and even private plunge pools. Delta décor involves kindling sconces, finely woven baskets and vintage campaign trunks. At the top of the food chain is the Geoffrey Kent Suite, named after the safari pioneer and founder of Abercrombie & Kent: 620 square metres of pavilions and decks accommodating up to six, with a chef, waiter, housekeeper, wildlife guide and vehicle on call.

Chobe River, near Sanctuary Chobe Chilwero lodge.

The camp is unfenced, which means it's occasionally necessary to pursue an alternative route from the dining pavilion to my suite to avoid an elephant, say, or a rabble of baboons. (At night, all guests heading to dinner must summon a staff escort by walkie-talkie.) At midnight, from behind glass doors, I watch a genet - resembling an oversized pet cat - creep onto my deck and lap from the pool, the tip of its long bushy tail twitching.

But the real, raw action happens on twice-daily drives in Moremi Game Reserve. Binoculars aloft, eco-checklists poised, we never fail to encounter an astonishing range of wildlife: there's the Big Five, the Little Five, and scores of creatures in between. In 90 minutes one morning we see, in the following order: a pair of hyenas, a catwalk of giraffes, a battle-scarred lion fast asleep beside the track, and a pack of rare painted dogs minding 13 playful speckled puppies. When Martin, our guide, parks the truck and sets out muffins for morning tea or mixes G&Ts at sunset, we're usually in wide open country where a single, slow head-swivel typically reveals grazing impala and kudu, zig-zag clusters of zebras, a family of elephants, a lagoon full of hippos and cranes, and a herd of buffalo on the move.

Guest pavilion bathroom.

By my last morning at Chief's Camp, the place is fairly bursting with life. It starts before dawn, with a shower of jackalberries followed by the alarming racket of baboons mating on my roof. After breakfast, I step off the main deck into a mokoro with a poler named Derek and we slide across the golden lagoon for the last time. There are birds everywhere: hunting, wading, nesting.

We return to camp as an elephant named Boy, a frequent visitor, wanders onto the scene and goes to step into the mokoro we've just vacated. Will he destroy the canoe? At the last moment, his foot clears the obstacle and he continues towards the pool.

Dear friends, we share planet Earth with millions of other species of plants and animals. Many of these species, especially animals, are in danger of disappearance or dying out completely in the near future. Once they become extinct, they are gone forever.

To protect and save these endangered creatures, “World Endangered Species Day” is celebrated each year on the third Friday of May, by animal welfare organisations. This year the day was celebrated on May 19, which was yesterday.

As these animals are our fellow dwellers of this planet, we need to know who are suffering and in danger of disappearing forever. Let’s check that out today, so here is an introduction of some endangered species.

Indus River dolphins

The blind Indus River dolphins are one of only four river dolphin species in the world that spend all of their lives in freshwater.

The beak of the Indus River dolphin is prominent, swollen at the tip and quite long, reaching 20 per cent of their body length, with large, visible teeth. Due to poor eyesight, they rely on their sharp voice to sense and map the environment around them. They get their food on the river bed.

The critically endangered blind dolphins are found in River Indus and it is said that there are only about 1,100 today in the lower parts of the river. Their numbers declined dramatically after the construction of an irrigation system.

Green turtle

The green turtle is cold-blooded animal, which lives in tropical and subtropical oceans. They have beautiful green hue on their skin. Their outer hard heart-shaped shell is wide and brownish olive colour. The inside of the shell is yellow. They cannot pull their head into the body.

When young, it feeds on crabs, jellyfish and other small creatures. But when it reaches adulthood, it becomes herbivores and eats sea grasses and algae.

Female turtles lay eggs on beaches and Sandspit, in Karachi, is a famous green turtle nesting beaches. These turtles are in danger due to the demand of their meat and eggs, which is considered as delicacies.

The red-crowned crane

These endangered birds are among the tallest birds in the world. Cranes are highly social birds and live in large flocks. They have long neck and legs, and large round wings. They have white plumage, with black secondary feathers.

During flight, their body forms a straight line from bill to toes, portraying a beautiful, elegant image. They live in deep water marshes of Japan, China and Russia. They eat snails, small fish, frogs, insects and snakes.

The long bill is useful in helping them survey the water for preys. They are famous for their dance. During their dance, they jerk, bounce, leaping up in the air and run wildly with outstretched wings.

The fossil records and prehistoric cave paintings show that red crowned bird is a primitive bird and existed 37 to 54 million years ago. Today, they are threatened mainly due to loss of habitat which are gradually being turned into farms or housing sites.

Sumatran elephants

These giant animals are critically endangered species. They are the residents of the plain forest in Sumatra, western Indonesia, close to rivers.

Bananas, ginger and young bamboo leaves are their favourite foods. Their current population in the wild is around two to three thousand only. Deforestation and economic development has badly affected their habitat and population.

Giant panda

The innocent, playful and heavyweight panda bear is an animal well-known to most children. It has large, prominent, black patches around its eyes. Its legs are smaller than other bears. Its front legs are longer than the back legs.

Bamboo is the love of their life as they spend approximately 12 hours of the day eating bamboo. They also eat carrots, apples and some insects. A panda spends most of its time eating and sleeping.

Giant pandas live in the mountains of south-western China, in damp, misty forests of bamboo. Fast urban development of China, destruction of forests and the hunting of pandas have made it difficult for them to survive. Today, only around 1,600 giant pandas are estimated to survive on Earth.

Pangolins

These are the world’s only scaly mammals and believed to be the most trafficked mammal in the world. They live in tropical forests, dry woodlands and the savannah.

There are four species of pangolins in the world, of these four are Asian while four are African. The body of a pangolin is completely covered with scales made of keratin. They can bend into a tight ball, with the scales out. This serves as a defence system to ward off predators. They feed on ants and termites, which they pick up with their long, sticky tongues.

Virtually no information is available on population levels of any species of pangolin as they are rarely observed due to their secretive, solitary and nocturnal habits. However, all species are thought to be in decline, with some more rapidly so than others — particularly the Asian species. Human rustlers are the main danger to the species. According to an estimate, more than a million pangolins have been taken from the wild in the past decade.

Snow leopard

The total body length of most snow leopards is between 86cm to 125cm. Their beautiful spotted skin change with the seasons — it is white and thick with fur that camouflages them in the snow in winter, while it turns to a fine yellow-grey coat in summer. Their tail is extra long, about 80 to 105 centimetres. It helps them to keep balance in rough mountainous regions and curls around the body to save the leopard from the severe cold.

This elegant animal typically lives in extreme high altitude and cold climate. Unlike other tigers and lions, snow leopards cannot give a full and deep roar. It is because of the under-development of the fibro-elastic tissue that forms part of the vocal apparatus.

They live in the high mountains of the Karakoram and the Hindukush. They are mainly found in Baltistan, Chitral, Gilgit, Upper Swat Valley, and the Slopes of Nanga Parbat.

They are critically endangered species, over the past 20 years, their numbers have declined by at least 20 per cent.

The saola

The saola is also referred to as the Asian unicorn because it is so rarely seen. There are thought to be no more than several hundred of them remaining in several isolated areas of tropical forest along the border between Vietnam and Laos.

Related to cattle but resembling an antelope, the saola has brown with white patches on its head and face, with a pair of straight, spindly horns. It can grow up to three feet and weigh up to 220 pounds (100 kilos).

It was first spotted in 1992, and has only been seen a few times. Illegal hunting and trapping are the main factors for its extinction, though deforestation is also an important factor.

Javan rhinoceros

The Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) is the most endangered of the world’s five rhinoceros species, with an estimated 40-60 animals remaining on the western tip of the Island of Java (Indonesia) in Ujung Kulon National Park.

The last member of another tiny population in Vietnam’s Cat Tien National Park was killed by poachers in 2011. The water- and swamp-loving Javan rhinoceros were once found throughout Southeast Asia and Indonesia, but due to excessive hunting for their prized horn, which is used to make folk medicines, they are now almost extinct.

Despite being protected now, the extreme low numbers will probably see this species becoming extinct soon.

The tiger

It may come as a surprise to some of you but the various subspecies of this large cat are on the verge of extinction and many have become extinct, such as the Caspian, Javan, Balinese, and South China tigers. All this has been the result of human activity — ruthless hunting and habitat loss.

The five subspecies that remain are the Amur, or Siberian tiger, the Bengal tiger, the Indochinese tiger, the Malayan tiger, and the Sumatran tiger. All of these tigers live in parts of Asia, and are estimated to be fewer than 3,000 in number.

The main driver of this looming extinction is the insatiable appetite for tiger bones, skins, eyes and other body parts in China and Vietnam, where tiger organs are used to make an array of traditional medicines.

Amur leopard

The Amur leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is a very rare leopard subspecies that lives only in the remote and snowy northern forests of eastern Russian’s Primorye region. Earlier it was found in regions of Korea and northern China, but it is now extinct in those countries.

A 2007 census counted only 14-20 adult Amur leopards and five to six cubs. Threats facing the species include habitat loss due to logging, road building and encroaching civilisation, poaching (illegal hunting) and global climate change.

0,"Fencing is increasingly used to separate humans and wildlife, but some elephants learn that their tusks do not conduct electricity and use them to break through even electric fences.

To discourage further fence-breaking at one South African elephant sanctuary, a manager developed a “tusk brace,” a stiff wire glued into a small groove in each tusk that conducts the electricity from the tip to the more sensitive base beneath the animal’s lip.

The braces reduced break-throughs by the repeat offenders, with no observable negative effects, though their use may be most appropriate with animals that are monitored regularly.

As development expands into previously natural areas, keeping such fences maintained, for the safety of both people and elephants, may become an unfortunate necessity.

As agriculture expands into traditional elephant habitat, human-elephant conflict (HEC) has become a major threat to long-term survival of African (and Asian) elephants, often facilitating poaching and habitat destruction.

Governments and farmers determined to save their crops have traditionally used various deterrence methods—including noise-makers, catapults, rocks, fire, barriers, shooting to scare, electric fencing, and translocation of problem elephants—to mitigate this conflict. For a review of some of the many approaches used to reduce HEC, see here and here, or consult the references below.

Electric fences, while costly to build and maintain, have—more than most other approaches—been shown to reduce HEC since they successfully separate people and elephants. When maintained, they are an effective wildlife management and conservation tool. Nonetheless, some elephants learn that their tusks do not conduct electricity. Fence-breaking elephants learn to use their tusks to pull wires up and down to break through electric fences, which brings them into contact with people, potentially causing danger to both sides.

In a novel use of some basic tools to help maintain costly electric fencing around reserves or farms, Alexander Vipond of the Knysna Elephant Park in South Africa invented a simple device, nicknamed “tusk braces,” to discourage elephants from cutting fence wires.

Mongabay-Wildtech asked Vipond about the inspiration for the tusk braces and their implementation and combined his on-the-ground experience with that of other HEC efforts for this article.

Where did he get the idea for tusk braces?

Electric fences are used in South Africa’s sanctuaries and private game reserves to keep people and elephants apart. Vipond’s idea for the wire came from a lot of time with elephants in large but enclosed areas, including with one beloved young male called Harry that had learned to break the area’s electric fence.

Electric fences have had success in minimizing human-elephant conflict, so long as they are maintained, but elephants that destroy fence wire can then also enable other elephants to pass through the fences into neighboring lands and villages. Elephants that destroy crops or property are unfortunately in danger of retaliation from angry farmers.

To protect both people and elephants such as Harry, Vipond wondered how he could possibly get him to stop breaking fences. More specifically, he asked, “How can I make Harry’s tusk into a conductor?”

How did he come up with the groove in the tusk?

Years before, Vipond had attended the elephant management training course at Riddle’s Elephant and Wildlife Sanctuary in Arkansas, USA, which teaches “old-school” elephant care and husbandry and “showed me the basics of what was required to keep an elephant, for lack of a better word, manageable.” While his own management approach is not “old-school,” his experience gave him an idea. The facility used a special device when it needed to move elephants from place to place. The device, made with a stainless steel band, like a hose clamp, mounted on the front of the tusks and connected to the floor, kept the elephants from hurting each other with their tusks while in transit.

The bands were more solid than a wire, but his designs with large pipe clamps would loosen over time, as tusks are tapered, rounded, and slick. In brainstorming a method to stop fence-breaking, Vipond wondered, “What if I could put a groove in the tusk from the elephant’s lip to the tip of his tusk that could carry the current to where he would feel it?”

What exactly are tusk braces and how did he put them on an elephant?

The tusk brace is basically a wire fit onto the length of the top of the tusk, like human braces. Vipond used a 3mm rustproof high-tensile wire that is stiff and bent to contour to the individual tusk. To keep it flush with the surface of the tusk, the team used a drill to cut a groove in the tusk just slightly (<1mm) deeper than the wire.

Using tools and fitting an elephant, even a domesticated one, with a tusk brace wire requires some sort of sedation. It also requires care and attention to detail. Most of the tusk is solid and lacks sensation, but where the tusk meets the animal’s lip, it is still thick but has a hollow interior. Vipond emphasized the care needed when drilling the tusk at that point to reduce any risk of damage.

The team held the wire in the groove with adhesive (a set of two epoxy glues mixed together from South Africa’s Pratley company hardened quickly and lasted the longest). A minimal amount of adhesive is important for holding the wire most securely–too much was less secure.

How does it help stop fence-breaking?

The bulk of the tusk does not conduct electricity. Fence-breaking elephants have learned this and will pull and push the wires of an electric fence with the tops of their tusks until the wires snap. A wire fitted into a groove along the edge of each tusk can conduct electricity from the end of the tusk, which lacks sensation, to just before it meets the lip, which is more sensitive. While not dangerous, an electric fence meant to control elephant movements gives a strong shock that the animals logically want to avoid.

How effective were the braces in discouraging fence breaking? Did the elephants lose the habit?

Of the two elephants that have been fitted with tusk braces by Vipond and his colleagues, both stopped breaking fences. Harry learned that his tusks were no longer effective and stopped breaking fences through to the present.

Shaka, the other elephant with tusk braces, initially stopped breaking fences but then learned he could still use the bottom of his tusks safely to cut through the fences. Alex described Shaka as “a very busy elephant–pushing trees, debarking trees, digging, etc–and eventually his wire came off the tip, so the team pulled it out and replaced it with another.

How long do they stay in place? What happens when the tusk grows?

It seems to be a mix. Shaka’s wire had to be replaced, and one of Harry’s two tusk brace wires also came off. Harry’s other wire is still in place, five years after they were first put in.

Tusks are large teeth, with nerve endings in the center of the upper portion. As the tusk grows, however, the inlaid wire moves farther and farther from the lip and stops carrying the current to sensitive tissue. Vipond therefore stressed that the wire needs to reach as far up on the tusk as possible.

Where else is this technique being used?

Vipond doesn’t know if anyone else has used the technology, though a local veterinarian phoned and asked whether there was a way to stop elephants from raiding, so Vipond sent him photos of the tusk braces.

Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya had a similar problem and trimmed off 2/3 of the tusks of four habitual fence-breakers there. This dramatically slowed fence-breaking, though these four bulls turned to other, less effective ways to get through the fence. However, it prompted critical ethical and ecological questions about an elephant’s need for tusks to dig for minerals, strip bark, maintain reproductive status and generally look like a normal elephant.

Does he see any downside? Would he recommend it to other sanctuaries, reserves or other places where elephants break fences?

When asked if he would recommend the setup to other managers, Vipond thought it could be helpful for facilities with domesticated or habituated elephants that can be monitored regularly. Vipond was concerned that if the wire got loose on a wild elephant from digging or stripping bark, it might not be found and could injure the animal. For the same reason, he added that elephants living in open grasslands might be better candidates than those in rougher terrain with denser bushes.

No single mitigation strategy has eliminated human-elephant conflict. Relatively few elephants break fences, but some are repeat offenders. The tusk brace is one of several novel strategies aimed to address a large and growing challenge for elephant conservation and human development.

Researchers have developed and tested ideas such as chili fences, beehive fences, and drones to help reduce HEC, and controlling elephant movements through electric fencing is already an unfortunate reality, even in many large landscapes. As more managers must rely on fencing of either reserves or neighboring farms to separate elephants and humans for the safety of both, the need to keep the fences maintained efficiently increasingly greater.

KARACHI: An Indus river dolphin was rescued in Larkana and released into safer waters by a joint team of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Pakistan and the Sindh Wildlife Department.

Residents spotted the 42-inch-long female dolphin stranded in Wassand Wah, a tributary of Larkana’s Warah Canal. Realising the urgency of relocating the animal to deeper water, they promptly shifted her to a nearby fish pond and then informed the wildlife authorities, according to a press release issued on Friday.

The rescue teams arrived and carried the dolphin in a sound proof ambulance to release her into the Indus River at Sukkur Barrage upstream.

Blind dolphin released back into Indus

WWF-Pakistan Senior Director of Programmes Rab Nawaz appreciated the community’s efforts to rescue the dolphin.

“The WWF-Pakistan believes in empowering community stewardship to conserve endangered species like the Indus river dolphin,” he said.

Nawaz said long-term community outreach and awareness programmes implemented as part of the Indus River Conservation Initiative had been instrumental in rescuing more than 140 stranded dolphins since 1992.

The Indus river dolphin is an endangered freshwater cetacean only found in the Indus River in Pakistan. It is also a WWF priority species. The largest population of the species is concentrated between Guddu and Sukkur barrages, a legally protected area known as the Indus Dolphin Game Reserve.

0,"Indian gharials are fish-eating crocodiles.

These reptiles are classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List.

WCS recently imported eight young gharials from the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust Center for Herpetology under a conservation partnership.

These gharials are on display at the Bronx Zoo.

The Bronx Zoo’s wild animal keeper sends out a special call, and eight of the most critically endangered animals on earth take a break from basking to scoot up the banks for their breakfast. The young gharials, Gavialis gangeticus, swing their slender snouts through the water and feed on their favorite food—fresh fish.

These bizarre-looking crocodilians are perfectly adapted for fishing with 106-110 needle-sharp teeth and long, thick tails topped with spikes that propel them across the pool. Among the largest of the crocodilian species, these juveniles at the zoo will continue to grow with older males approaching 20 feet in length. As the males mature, they will develop a large, bulbous growth on the end of their snouts called a ghara (the Hindi word for small pot) hence the name “gharial.” The ghara is used for both a visual signal to other gharials and in producing loud sounds for communication.

In the wild, these fish-eating crocodiles are in trouble, suffering chronic long term and rapid short term declines due to human activities according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Historically, their parts (penis and fat, in particular) were used in traditional medicine. And habitat loss, overfishing, and agricultural development have decimated their numbers. Once found in 5 countries, today fewer the 2500 adults remain and 80 percent of those are found in the Chambal River of Northern India. Projects are underway to learn more about their ecology including their seasonal migrations within river systems and key breeding and nesting areas.

It is critical to conserve those that remain.

The St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park announces a rare occurrence in North America: the hatching of four freshwater Johnston’s crocodiles, Crocodylus johnstoni. The new babies mark the first time the species has hatched at the zoo and only the second time babies of this species were welcomed in North America, with first captive hatch credits going to the Baltimore Aquarium. The four baby crocs and their proud parents, Derek and Bindi, will wait to see if more hatchlings emerge from the remaining eggs in the clutch.

“It’s a first for us, very exciting. And we might have one or two more soon. We try not to count our crocs before they hatch. I don’t want to jinx it, but we’re hopeful.”

“These are Johnston’s crocodiles, what Australians refer to as ‘freshies,’ said Jim Darlington, Reptile Curator at The Alligator Farm. “It’s a first for us, very exciting. And we might have one or two more soon. We try not to count our crocs before they hatch. I don’t want to jinx it, but we’re hopeful.”

The new hatchlings continue a trend of new arrivals that began last summer with the arrival of the first Indian gharial to be hatched outside of India or Nepal. The gharial’s birthday celebration was soon followed by the arrival of six baby Galapagos tortoises, who began hatching the same day as the gharial. Their birth marked the first time this endangered species was bred at the Alligator Farm since the arrival of Galapagos tortoises at the park in 1947.

“The hatching of the freshies is another terrific achievement in terms of animal conservation, which is a vital part of our mission” said John Brueggen, Zoo Director. “I’m proud of our team of reptile keepers who helped make this happen, and I’m looking forward to inviting visitors to the zoo to see the new baby freshies.”

Mysuru: Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, popularly known as the Mysuru Zoo and one of the oldest zoos of the country received two reptile species for breeding from Tamil Nadu on Sept. 6.

Four Rock Pythons (Two males and two females) and five Gharials (Two males and three females) were received from Madras Crocodile Bank Trust in Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu as per the approval accorded by the Central Zoo Authority of India, New Delhi, under Animal Exchange Programme in the form gift for the purpose of conservation of breeding. The health conditions of the animals are stable, according to a press release from Zoo Executive Director C. Ravishankar.

Indian Rock Python: Indian Rock Python (Python Molurus) is a large non-venomous Python species found in many tropic and sub-tropic areas of the Indian Sub-continent and Southeast Asia. It is also known as Indian Python, Black-Tailed Python and Indian Rock Python.

They are found in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jammu & Kashmir, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Puducherry, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttrakhand and West Bengal.

This reptile can be easily identified by checking its large size, dark irregular patches, pinkish head and slow locomotion.

On provocation, it coils itself and keeps head slightly above the ground; hiss almost the same like Russell’s Viper and bites repeatedly if one comes in its attacking range. On catching its prey, the Python tightly coils around the limbs and suffocate the prey before swallowing it whole.

Though Indian Rock Python is non-venomous, it gives injurious bite with numerous small but sharp teeth which can cause skin rupture on the site of bite.

Indian Rock Python is one of the most threatened species due to- Road kill mortality; killing due to conflict in agricultural fields and around water bodies due to its large size; due to misidentification and confusion with venomous species Russell’s Viper which share almost the same kind of habitat.

This reptile is killed for its beautiful and tough skin and its trade is high in various parts of country which is illegal. Habitat loss is one more reason because this species prefers wet surrounding or long time stable water bodies for its activities. Due to destruction of water bodies, habitat of Python remains no more natural and it has to migrate from the area. Like all Pythons, Indian Rock Python is always in demand by foreign and Indian keepers for pet trade.

Gharial (Gavialis Gangeticus): The gharial (Gavialis Gangeticus), also known as the Gavial, is a crocodilian of the Gavialidae family. This fish-eating crocodile is a native of the northern part of the Indian Sub-continent.

Gharial is one of the three species of crocodilians found only in the Indian sub-continent and is also known as Long-nosed Crocodile and is the longest living species of crocodilians in the world.

Gharial was found in India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Myanmar but is now are extinct in most of these countries. The remaining Gharial populations are restricted to India and Nepal.

Gharials used to grow up to 7 mts (23 ft), in the past history of India. Due to hunting for skins, medicine and habitat loss, Gharials now fall in the category of one of the most Critically Endangered Species of reptile in the world.

Today, small populations of Gharials are present in Son River, Girwa River, the Ganges, Mahanadi River and the Chambal River. National Chambal Sanctuary is the only place in India where a large wild population of Gharial is found.",Mysuru Zoo gets reptiles from Tamil Nadu,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vc3Rhcm9mbXlzb3JlLmNvbS9teXN1cnUtem9vLWdldHMtcmVwdGlsZXMtdGFtaWwtbmFkdS_SAT1odHRwczovL3N0YXJvZm15c29yZS5jb20vbXlzdXJ1LXpvby1nZXRzLXJlcHRpbGVzLXRhbWlsLW5hZHUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://starofmysore.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/News-15-2.jpg,2017-09-10,"{'sent': 'Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, popularly known as the Mysuru Zoo and one of the oldest zoos of the country received two reptile species for breeding from Tamil Nadu on Sept. 6.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Mysuru Zoo'], 'CARDINAL': ['two', 'one'], 'PERSON': ['Tamil Nadu']}}",Gharial

0,"ISLAMABAD: A one-year project for the conservation of endangered blind dolphins in Indus water has been initiated by Pakistan Museum of Natural History (PMNH) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

Speaking about the project, PMNH Director General Dr Muhammad Rafique said that the Indus river dolphins were an endangered species found in Pakistan and a joint effort had been launched to preserve them. The project was launched in January this year and is scheduled to finish in December, with an allocation of Rs 2.5 million. The timeline of the project may be extended if needed, he informed.

He highlighted that there were only four to five hundred dolphins of the rare species left when PMNH raised the issue and contacted UNESCO for funding and technical assistance to launch the project.

He said that PMNH had also worked with Capital Development Authority (CDA) on a project aimed at beautifying Islamabad, and their joint efforts have revealed wood chopping and wood extraction as the major threats to its beauty. Wood chopping causes a number of environmental problems including noise, air and dust pollution, Rafique said. He added that in the past, stone crushing had also been a major concern but it has now been controlled.

The director further said that PMNH facilitated research students of various universities under Higher Education Commission to explore nature and complete their projects. There are over 40 PhD scholars at PMNH and each of them is working on a separate, specialised project, he said.

Moreover, researchers at PMNH share their research, which they conduct in well-equipped laboratories of the museum, with scientists from other countries, and a mutual exchange of scholars and technology constantly takes place, Rafique said.

He expressed hope that such efforts would go long ways not only in reducing the costs of their projects but also in achieving better results within stipulated deadlines.","PMNH, UNESCO striving to conserve Indus river dolphins",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBha2lzdGFudG9kYXkuY29tLnBrLzIwMTcvMTAvMjAvcG1uaC11bmVzY28tc3RyaXZpbmctdG8tY29uc2VydmUtaW5kdXMtcml2ZXItZG9scGhpbnMv0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGFraXN0YW50b2RheS5jb20ucGsvMjAxNy8xMC8yMC9wbW5oLXVuZXNjby1zdHJpdmluZy10by1jb25zZXJ2ZS1pbmR1cy1yaXZlci1kb2xwaGlucy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cache.pakistantoday.com.pk/988531048A1EA35DDB5A3B4BE12F33FF.jpg,2017-10-20,"{'sent': 'A one-year project for the conservation of endangered blind dolphins in Indus water has been initiated by Pakistan Museum of Natural History (PMNH) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['UNESCO', 'Pakistan Museum of Natural History', 'United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization', 'Indus']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"Vladik, a well-known, lone male Siberian tiger, has hit the road again.

The endangered four-year-old tiger was recently spotted in the same region where he was exiled this time last year.

Vladik first made headlines in October 2016 when he wandered into the far eastern Russian town of Vladivostok, his namesake. The Siberian tiger population in this area has been low after habitat loss and hunting caused their population to plummet in the 1930s. It's extremely rare for residents to see a tiger in the streets, so when 300-pound Vladik sauntered into town, they panicked.

The Siberian Times reported that police patrolled the streets with machine guns and drones. Vladik was eventually captured after police received a tip about his whereabouts, tracked him down, fired a sedative shot into his neck, and transferred the comatose tiger to the Amur Tiger Center, a group that works to rescue and rehabilitate Siberian tigers. (Read more about Vladik's capture.)

For seven months, Vladik stayed at the center, where veterinarians monitored his health and tested his hunting skills. For his release, Amur, World Wildlife Fund Russia, and Russia's Natural Resources Ministry sponsored a helicopter to fly the big cat into Bikin National Park.

It was a conservation success story with a happy ending. But Vladik had other plans.

For months, the tiger has been roaming the region, preying on Himalayan black bears, crossing a highway, traversing a railroad track, and bypassing several small towns. He walked nearly 400 miles south, where he was spotted just outside of his old stomping grounds, Vladivostok. This time around, however, Vladik seems to be exercising more caution and keeping a lower profile.

The center admitted they've known for months that Vladik moved out of the park but only recently made that knowledge public, out of fear for the cat's safety. Officials know where the tiger is because they fitted him with a GPS tracking collar before he was released into the park, in part to study movements of the species.

So far, Vladik hasn't walked in front of the camera traps the center has rigged along his predicted path, so they've only been able to track his motion from afar.

""We are joking that this might be a 'victory lap,'"" said Andrey Shorshin from the Amur Tiger Center.

Large male tigers like Vladik are known to roam large distances in search of territory that may provide access to a mate and a steady food supply.

Ten percent of the world's endangered Amur tiger population resides in Bikin National Park, and officials speculated that Vladik may have left because of overcrowding. Reconciling a slowly rebounding tiger population with increasing development is a difficult problem for the Amur Tiger Center and other conservationists. Roughly 500 Siberian tigers can be found in the region, and their population is expected to grow.",Endangered Siberian Tiger Returns From Exile,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE3LzExL3ZsYWRpay12bGFkaXZvc3Rvay1ydXNzaWEtZmFyLWVhc3Qtc2liZXJpYW4tdGlnZXItc3BkL9IBfWh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uL3B1YmxpYy9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDE3LzExL3ZsYWRpay12bGFkaXZvc3Rvay1ydXNzaWEtZmFyLWVhc3Qtc2liZXJpYW4tdGlnZXItc3Bk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/329/706/nw-dly-ds1702001-186-amur-tiger-release-vin_640x360_953828419671.jpg,2017-11-02,"{'sent': 'Vladik first made headlines in October 2016 when he wandered into the far eastern Russian town of Vladivostok, his namesake.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Vladivostok']}}",Tiger
0,"For his new book on endangered species, Tim Flach had to sidestep poachers and got stranded in Gabon. As he tells Tracy Calder, it was all worth it if it makes us value our precious world more

The saiga, a nomadic antelope whose range extends from Kazakhstan to Uzbekistan, is a curious-looking creature. A survivor from the ice ages, its drooping nose can warm up cold air (essential for bitter winters) while filtering out dust (for dry summers).

“The saiga looks like something out of the canteen scene in Star Wars,” laughs photographer Tim Flach as he recalls his brief encounter with the animal. Tim may be laughing now but this goat-like creature proved extremely tricky to photograph.

“These animals have been decimated through hunting for their horns,” he reveals.

Only the males grow horns, which are sold in East Asia for their supposed medicinal properties. In 2015 a deadly virus hit the population and this, combined with poaching, has caused numbers to plummet. As a result, the saiga are now a critically endangered species – and are extremely hard to find.

With the help of a contact in Moscow, Tim located a saiga herd – but it was just the beginning of his troubles.

“I visited an area near the Caspian Sea during the summer and found myself in a fly-infested location,” he recalls. “By 9.30am the heat was so fierce that it distorted the air and my pictures were blurred.”

Not to be deterred, Tim returned during the winter months when temperatures fell to -35°C. Against all odds, this time he got his picture.

“Poachers hunt the saiga on a kind of moped, so when they hear a motor, or any kind of noise, they just run and run,” he explains.

“I photographed one saiga as he was glancing back but by the time I took another shot, he was gone.”

Eye-opening

More than two years in the making, Endangered, Tim’s latest book, is eye-opening in every sense. Who knew that vultures play such a crucial role in disease prevention, for example?

“Vultures are nature’s cleaners,” says Tim. “They live off the dead and they clean the carcasses. Now 90% of them have disappeared and it’s having different consequences in different continents.”

He explains that in India, for example, cases of rabies have increased as dogs have filled the gap left by the birds’ rapid decline. Unlike vultures, their digestive systems cannot destroy dangerous pathogens and consequently they pass them on to humans.

Deciding which endangered species to feature in his book resulted in some interesting conversations.

“I asked a lot of eminent people which animals I should include but the world’s panda expert is just going to say ‘pandas’!” he laughs.

Continues below…

Nevertheless, he spent six months asking leading scientists and conservationists questions about value systems and nature. One of them was Dr Jonathan Baillie, chief scientist at the National Geographic Society.

“Jonathan has been at the coalface, educating people about conservation,” says Tim. “Like many conservationists he is concerned about how traditional wildlife photography can create action. There is a difference between what we know and what we act upon.”

Jonathan wrote the excellent prologue and epilogue to Tim’s new book.

Telling stories

In the end Tim decided to look for stories, rather than follow any prescribed ‘endangered species’ list. The vultures are a perfect example.

“Instead of going after the glamorous animals everyone else chases in the Maasai Mara I chased vultures, because their story is so important,” he explains.

Another obvious candidate of endangered species was the ploughshare tortoise. Highly prized by poachers due to their glorious shells, these land-based reptiles only live in Baly Bay in Madagascar and take 15 years to reach their breeding age. As a consequence, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust goes to great lengths to protect them. It might seem drastic but defacing their shells seems to be the most effective way to deter poachers. With this in mind, Tim photographed ploughshare tortoises both with and without their man-made engravings.

The endangered species of western lowland gorilla was another must-have subject for the book. Habitat loss and illegal hunting are the main threats here but what’s less well known is the role these gorillas play in the tropical forest ecosystem. They have a fruit-based diet and disperse seeds via their droppings. Once again, Tim was after the story but this time he got more than he bargained for.

“There was a military clampdown during my visit,” he recalls. “Law and order broke down, so it was a struggle to get home. The planes wouldn’t pick us up because the pilots were scared. They didn’t behave in a particularly honourable way and left us in Gabon. I had a wonderful experience watching the gorillas but then it comes back to humans again.”

Tim did get home eventually but the experience left its mark.

Like most images in his book, the lowland gorillas were photographed with a Canon EOS 5DS.

“It’s got a 50MP sensor and is amazingly good at catching high-speed action,” enthuses Tim.

To prove his point he draws my attention to an incredible picture of a lowland gorilla scooping a handful of water to its mouth. The water has created a reflective coating on the gorilla’s knuckles and you can see the forest canopy on the surface of its dark skin.

“This picture was taken handheld from a boat,” explains Tim.

Familiar faces

If you’re familiar with Tim’s work, you might recognise a few pictures in Endangered – the shots of Celebes crested macaques, for example are taken from his ‘More Than Human’ series. He makes no apologies for the repetition.

“There are 20 images in the book that I borrowed from my other projects, partly because it seemed crazy to go back and redo them, but also because I knew I could rework the files,” he explains.”Photographers evolve and we know how to manage things differently, so we can take a file and start again from scratch.”

There are familiar settings, too. The pictures of military macaws were shot in Tim’s studio, for example. But there were also countless times when he was forced outside his comfort zone. On one such occasion he dived to a depth of 35 metres in the sea off the Galapagos Islands with a school of hammerhead sharks circling high above him.

“I’m not an underwater photographer and I’ve never pretended to be but for my own integrity I needed to cover every aspect,” he says. “Oceans make up the majority of the surface area of the planet, so I couldn’t just ignore them!”

So, having photographed endangered species from a single cave-dwelling olm to a swarm of migrating monarch butterflies, I wonder how Tim feels about the state of the planet and our role as its custodians.

“I feel that I could, perhaps, be useful,” he explains. “I hope the book brings stories that touch people emotionally and make them better placed to know how to move forward. Our most valued treasure is the world we are in and if we are not careful, we are going to spoil our nest and lose the most valuable thing we have.”

Endangered by Tim Flach is published by Abrams (ISBN 978-1-41972- 651-4) and features more than 180 images documenting the lives of endangered species.

Tim Flach studied fine art at St Martin’s College of Art and Design. He emerged with a fascination for photography that has led to numerous commissions, awards, solo exhibitions and a presence in permanent collections around the world. Endangered is his fourth and most ambitious book to date. To find out more visit www.timflach.com.

0,"This was a twitter exchange between myself and Tom Woods, who is a prominent Austrian-economist historian. He is an anarcho-capitalist.

The context of the conversation is that we were both responding to the Trump administration’s recent decision to lift the ban on the ivory trade, which concerned many animal-rights and environmental groups since they believe that this will encourage more poaching. Woods didn’t say anything else, even though my statement was open for a response.

Allowing people to eat chicken meat has had the effect of increasing the demand for chickens while also increasing their supply. So no, I'm pretty sure I've got it. But thx for the concern https://t.co/VcNpB7urth — Tom Woods (@ThomasEWoods) November 19, 2017

Two Camps

Like all economics, central to this issue is supply and demand.

Elephant ivory is a luxury commodity because of its low supply in nature, and relatively high demand; poachers, therefore, make large profits by acquiring it and feeding into the market of conspicuous consumption.

One economic camp asserts that the solution to the problem is simple: market liberalization, via legalization of the ivory trade. Depending on the free-market inclinations of the individual, it’s unclear as to how much regulation, in any, there should be in order to satisfactorily address this problem.

In the case of Tom Woods, an Austrian economist, I won’t hold my breath in anticipation of him being in favor of any sort of regulation.

The other economic camp asserts that supply and demand respond to public policy, in which in our case, legalizing the ivory trade would have a harmful effect on the elephant population.

Placing the Ivory Trade in Context

At the cusp of the 20th century, it is estimated that as many as 3-5 million elephants roamed the African continent.

According to the final results of the Great Elephant Census, the largest wildlife survey in history, today’s population of the African Savannah elephant stands at 352, 271. This represents a 30 percent decrease in the population in just seven years (from 2007-2014). On average, poachers are killing an African Savannah elephant every 15 minutes.

Such a drastic reduction of the population has rendered the African elephant ‘vulnerable’, according to the IUCN Red List.

The IUCN is the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and their Red List is regarded as the most comprehensive inventory of the international conservation status of known biological species.

The vulnerable distinction indicates that the available evidence shows “a high risk of extinction in the wild.”

The main causes for their population’s demise are poaching and habitat loss due to a growing population in African countries. Although according to the Red List, habitat loss may at present be the larger threat to their survival, poaching is without question a significant factor.

Far too many elephant poachers operate under a veneer of illegality without the consequences for it, because elephant poaching remains in legal limbo.

The Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is an international treaty tasked with protecting endangered plants and animals. In 1989, the African elephant was listed in Appendix I, meaning that it was recognized as an animal that faces a high risk of extinction, and is affected by trade.

However, from 1997 to 2000, several countries – Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia and Botswana – moved to designate the African elephant to Appendix II, which states that the animal doesn’t face a high-risk level of extinction, and instead needs to be a part of a regulated market.

Since the treaty allows for national discretion in terms of implementing public policy, those countries have continued the ivory trade by granting regulated poaching rights.

This contradicted the treaty’s designation of African elephants on Appendix I.

Chinese and American demand have driven the global market for ivory for the past 10 years. The United States under the Obama administration began a new shift in the markets by establishing a nearly total ban on domestic ivory trade, arguing that doing so would help curb demand for elephant trophies.

Recently, however, the Trump administration has opted to reverse this trend and allow elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, effectively reigniting demand.

In China, which has the largest market for ivory, the story is a little different. The ivory industry is completely legal and has been called “white gold” by Chinese investors. A kilogram of raw ivory can be worth about $2,100, or $21,000 for the average tusk of an adult elephant. But China surprised the world by announcing last year that they will ban the ivory trade in their country by the end of 2017, delivering a blow to the ivory industry.

Back to the Economics

So, the question posed is what exactly will help protect elephant populations: legalizing the ivory trade, or banning it?

The answer is obvious.

First of all, whether there should be any regulation should be out of the question, if the intention is to preserve the species. The reason why is because it would be naive to assume that eliminating regulations would allow for that; without the fear of legal retribution, most poachers, who don’t care for conservation, would simply worry about making a profit, which means they will predictably run the elephants into extinction. Historically, the business goal of short-term gains from profit has created long-term social costs.

The nature of the ivory market is also fundamentally different from that of chickens, as Tom fallaciously compared it to. The supply of chickens is able to keep up with the demand for them because they are mass-produced. The same cannot be said for elephants: they can’t be mass-produced in the same manner chickens are, and even if they somehow could, they require much more resources in order to grow, a huge problem already, considering their habitat loss.

Already suffering from a severely restricted population, legalizing elephant poaching will only dwindle their it further, because of increased demand for the product due to conspicuous advertising.

Evidence of this net effect is pervasive and undeniable.

A legal sale in 2008 between China, Japan and four African nations was intended to cut down on poaching by flooding the market with supply, crashing prices and making poaching less profitable. Accredited Chinese and Japanese traders purchased 107 tonnes of ivory stockpiled from elephants for $15 million.

According to research that combed through CITES data, the 2008 legal sale exacerbated the problem, resulting in “an abrupt, significant, permanent, robust and geographically widespread increase” in elephant poaching.

Then there was the initial 1989 ban on ivory, which several months after its implementation by CITES, resulted in a global collapse of the ivory market.

The efficacy of the ban was recognized back in 1990 by the New York Times: “The bans on imports have cut the price of raw ivory in Africa as much as 90 percent, according to the report. ”There is really no incentive to smuggle since there is no longer a demand.””

Parallels can also be drawn from the not-so-distant cousin of elephant poaching: commercial whaling.

During the industrial revolution, demand for whales significantly increased. Then a legal market, they were considered valuable because of their oil, which was used in everything from soap, to cars, to lamps.

Unlike the Austrian conceptualization of economics, allowing people to use whale oil had the effect of increasing demand while also rapidly decreasing their supply.

Many whale populations were reduced by 90 percent or more (near the point of extinction) due to commercial whaling. Our centuries of abuse was halted thanks to the international ban on commercial whaling instituted by the International Whaling Commission in 1986.

Nonetheless, the damage has been done, and several dozen whale species are endangered. It remains to be seen whether some small populations will even be able to bounce back.

In the case of whales, elephants, and other limited supply goods, Austrian economics fails every time for the simple reason that constrained supply and unlimited demand are incompatible. Utility maximization theory isn’t a sufficient argument for preservation because enough people are willing to spend good money on ivory now, to the point where it quickly eats through the global supply.

In other words, we will almost always see in these types of cases that supply will be drained quicker than it can be replenished, so long as demand wills it.

0,"The number of the endangered Indus River dolphin, also known as bhulan or the ‘blind dolphin’, is on the rise – a significant positive development despite pollution threat, a study conducted by WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) Pakistan has revealed.

In its report titled ‘Signs of Hope for the Endemic and Endangered Bhulan,’ WWF Pakistan noted that the species, almost at point of extinction a decade ago, has increased in number from only 1,200 in 2001 to 1816 -1900 in 2017.

The study, conducted by a team of experts from the Zoological Survey Department of Pakistan, WWF Pakistan, academic researchers from various educational institutions and the wildlife departments of Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, concluded at least 1,816 dolphins were sighted in the long stretch of 808 kilometres of the main channel of the Indus River.

The blind dolphin is an obligate freshwater cetacean species found in the Indus River, Pakistan. It is the second most endangered freshwater dolphin species in the world, the first being the ‘functionally extinct’ Yangtze River dolphin.

WWF Pakistan says it has adopted a participatory approach to working for the conservation of this endangered and endemic species.

A dolphin rescue programme has been in place since 1992, jointly led by WWF Pakistan and the Sindh Wildlife Department to rescue any stranded dolphins from canals and safely release them back into the main river channel.

WWF Pakistan and the Sindh Wildlife Department have also established a dolphin monitoring network in collaboration with relevant stakeholders and local communities to monitor the Indus River as well as its adjacent canals and tributaries to rescue any stranded dolphins.",Endangered Indus River dolphin’s population on rise: WWF report,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBha2lzdGFudG9kYXkuY29tLnBrLzIwMTcvMTIvMTQvZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1pbmR1cy1yaXZlci1kb2xwaGlucy1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLW9uLXJpc2Utd3dmLXJlcG9ydC_SAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5wYWtpc3RhbnRvZGF5LmNvbS5way8yMDE3LzEyLzE0L2VuZGFuZ2VyZWQtaW5kdXMtcml2ZXItZG9scGhpbnMtcG9wdWxhdGlvbi1vbi1yaXNlLXd3Zi1yZXBvcnQvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cache.pakistantoday.com.pk/indusdolphin.jpg,2017-12-14,"{'sent': 'The number of the endangered Indus River dolphin, also known as bhulan or the ‘blind dolphin’, is on the rise – a significant positive development despite pollution threat, a study conducted by WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature)', 'ents': {'GPE': ['bhulan'], 'ORG': ['World Wide Fund', 'the ‘blind dolphin’', 'WWF']}}",Indus River Dolphin

AS PART of its mission to clean the Ganga by 2020, the Central government has sanctioned the raising of a Territorial Army (TA) battalion comprising ex-servicemen of the Army.

This battalion will be raised in Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh, next month as a Composite Ecological Task Force (CETF) battalion of TA for National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG).

The government has allocated Rs 167 crore for the battalion under NMCG, the nodal agency for cleaning the Ganga. The battalion will work on a book debit system with funding provided from the budget of the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation.

Due to the slow pace of progress, it is feared that the government may miss its deadline of making the Ganga clean by 2020. This was noted by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Water Resources last year.

In December 2017, a CAG report tabled in Parliament noted that the NMCG “could not utilise any amount out of the Clean Ganga Fund”, which meant that the entire amount of Rs 198.14 crore — as of 31 March 2017 —was lying in banks.

The CETF TA battalion, to be commanded by a Colonel-rank officer, will have eight officers, 20 JCOs and around 500 other ranks on its roll. For the task, it will only enroll ex-servicemen, who will be embodied under TA rules.

Territorial Army, which comes under the Defence Ministry, is considered a second line of defence after the regular Army. Nine Ecological Task Force (ETF) battalions of TA have been raised to execute specific environment-related projects.

The proposal for raising the CETF TA battalion emanated from the Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare in the Defence Ministry, which took up a case in 2014 for cleaning the Ganga. The proposal was vetted and approved by the ministry and the case was forwarded to NMCG. After an approval from the NMCG late last year, the Defence Ministry concurred and issued a Government Sanction Letter last month.

As per an official document, the new CETF TA battalion will be raised in Allahabad “as a pilot project”, and “will be responsible for the tasks and activities related to resurrecting the Ganga”. The battalion will be responsible for monitoring ecological and environmental projects related to the river, and also raise public awareness through campaigns, the official document states.

Although the exact charter of duties is still to be finalised, sources said that besides planting trees and checking soil erosion, the CETF TA will also manage public awareness campaigns, patrol sensitive river areas for the protection of biodiversity, keep a tab on the river pollution levels, assist the government in enforcing pollution control measures, support local civil administration and police in managing the ghats, and provide support and assistance if and when there is a flood or natural disaster in the region.

0,"The Siberian, or Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) is celebrated as a national animal of Korea. It is also widely considered to be extinct on the peninsula.

Where at the beginning of the twentieth century the animal’s range encompassed the endless forests of what is now the Russian Far East, Manchuria, and Korea, now it is largely confined to a handful of reserves dotted throughout Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsk Krai, and northern China.

Only around five hundred Siberian tigers remain in the wild, stalking wild boar or roe deer through the woods, or else stalked themselves by avid wildlife documentarians eager to capture the elusive cat on film.

In Korea, absence has made the heart grow fonder. The image of these animals, at least south of the DMZ, has been thoroughly sanitized. Shorn from the memory is their regular predation on livestock and, occasionally, on people, and the tiger is now fondly appreciated as a playful, even cuddly, symbol of national pride.

It is an impression cemented by the stunning remove of the South Korean landscape from the archipelago of small towns and dense forests that preceded it. Seoul, for one, is no longer the same warren of wooden houses and royal palaces that channeled tigers through its gardens, parks, and sewers.

And yet, there remain a few isolated stretches of the Korean peninsula where one might imagine a handful of these animals continuing to eke out a sheltered, if fragile, existence. The forests of North Hamgyong province, composed of broadleaf and pine forests, support boar, roe deer and other ungulate populations – it is an ecosystem that could conceivably sustain a small number of tigers all year round.

NARROW ACCESS

It was to find a way to prove this that, in 1997, brought Anatolii Kachur to Pyongyang. As deputy director at the Pacific Geographical Institute in Vladivostok, Kachur had been involved in conservation projects in the region for almost two decades.

The organization had been exchanging data on Siberian tigers with scientists from the DPRK for a number of years, yet without sources of funding, no joint field survey had been attempted.

Only around five hundred Siberian tigers remain in the wild

A pitch to UNESCO broke this impasse. “When the funding was approved, we immediately contacted the Korean side and arranged a meeting,” Kachur says.

The talks in Pyongyang proved difficult; access to the desired survey sites by foreign conservation workers was not a realistic possibility. On the last day of negotiations, however, the mood abruptly changed.

“According to our Korean colleagues, the final decision was made by Kim Jong Il, who personally considered the goals of this project and approved its implementation.”

Before an international team would be allowed into the country, it was agreed that specialists from the North Korean Institute of Geography would conduct their own preliminary survey in the Paektu Mountain Area.

It was there, close to the quasi-sacred sites of the Korean revolution, that all sides hoped evidence of the elusive tiger might soon be discovered.

SAVAGE GOD

In the beginning, Hwanung, son of the Lord of Heaven, descended unto Mount Paektu to found a new civilization. The culture prospered, and one day a bear and a tiger prayed to Hwanung that they, too, might be transformed into people, so that they could have human children. He agreed, on the condition that the two animals shelter in a cave for one hundred days and only eat magic herbs.

After twenty days, the tiger could suffer this regime no longer and left the cave. The bear endured, however, and after her hundredth day into the cave transformed into a human woman and married Hwanung. Together they had a son, Tangun, who would establish the kingdom of Gojoseon, the first Korean state.

For centuries, the tiger was considered indivisible from Korean culture: present at its beginning, it would probably remain there until its end, prowling across its hills and forests, its folktales and proverbs.

Throughout, its conduct would remain unpredictable. The Korean word for tiger is horang-I, Ho deriving from the Chinese character referring to the physical animal, and rang meaning “young boy.” According to religious scholar Edward R. Canda, the effect is to portray the tiger in the Korean imagination as childlike in temperament, pointing towards its “ambivalent nature: dangerous, powerful, innocent, harmless.”

This dual state would have proven little comfort to any Korean unfortunate enough to face the animal alone. For much of Korea’s history, tigers were known for routinely killing and eating individuals in the countryside, especially in mountainous areas.

As early as the 14th century, the Joseon dynasty employed specialists to hunt the animals, to guard against further attacks and skin them for fur. These men – accompanied by trained dogs and armed with matchlocks, lances and short swords – were celebrated for their bravery and skill, often having only one chance to bring the animal down lest they, too, be devoured.

“According to our Korean colleagues, the final decision was made by Kim Jong Il, who personally considered the goals of this project and approved its implementation.”

Not all tigers killed in the pre-modern period were killed in self-defense. The animals were, at times, so common that hunts were deliberately organized for sport and the collection of furs. As Canda notes, tiger artifacts were prized for their ability to ‘magically enhance human power.’

Tiger skins were used as luxurious household objects, lain on floors and chairs to assert wealth or nobility. Tiger cheeks and whiskers were sewn into hats worn by the royal bodyguards of the Yi dynasty. Tiger claws were given by husbands to their wives as tokens of their courage, or worn around the neck by children as lucky charms. Tiger bones were broken up and their gelatin extracted, to be mixed with wine and drunk to increase sexual potency. Pictures of tigers were even hung on front doors, to ward off evil spirits.

This semi-permanent state of vigilance among Koreans led to dozens of proverbs using tigers as a jumping-off point for wider illustrations of common sense.

Popular sayings included “Block a hole in a window at the sight of a tiger,” a fatalistic reference to the precautions one must take against imminent danger to life (Korean windows were often made of hanji paper, and would provide little defence against a tiger determined to leap into a house); “the wolf at the front gate, the tiger at the back”, implying a choice between two undesirable outcomes; and “Speak of the tiger and then he appears,” a phrase explaining link between an obsession with danger and its inadvertent invitation. The proverb is almost identical in meaning to its counterpart in English, which substitutes the presence of the tiger for the devil himself.

MADNESS AND SHADOWS

Stepping off the train at Rajin, Dale Miquelle was hoping the devil might appear for him. An expert on Siberian tigers and a biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Primorsky Krai, he had spent the first half of the 1990s, trapping the animals in the wild and analyzing their movements.

WCS had worked closely in collaboration with its counterparts in Russian scientific organizations, including the Pacific Institute of Geography, on conservation measures for the Siberian tiger.

When Kachur and his colleagues returned from Pyongyang, it was perhaps only natural that WCS was included in the next stage of the proceedings: a meeting between all stakeholders in Rajin, to present the results of a preliminary North Korean field survey and discuss future conservation measures.

Initially, Miquelle hoped that this would involve a joint Russian-North Korean expedition: “Russian field biologists are exceptional at identifying the species, at least, [from] tracks, and for tigers, sometimes, you can identify the sex of the animal based on the size of the [footprints.]”

Unsurprisingly, given the somewhat obscure location of the meeting, Miquelle and his colleagues were watched at all times, and largely confined to their hotel. It was “unusual for me, as an American, to be in that little corner,” he recalls. “It was probably best that everyone just assumed I was Russian, along with my Russian colleagues, except for the few individuals from the Institute who knew better.”

Eventually, they met with director of the North Korean Institute of Geography Kim Jin Rak. It was an awkward encounter, not least for the director, who Miquelle assumes had not spoken to an American before.

“It was probably best that everyone just assumed I was Russian”

“And to be honest, it was the first time for me to be in North Korea talking to officials,” he admits. “But I think that there was a genuine common interest in the fate of tigers and leopards in that part of the world that allowed us to work through all the differences that exist between the countries, to find a common ground for the discussion of tigers.”

As planned, the North Koreans provided the results of their survey. They had chosen a search area of 6,000km2 of land in Ryanggang Province. Within that, the scientists had trudged along 700km of survey routes, and interviewed over a dozen local people – farmers, hunters, fishermen – about possible sightings. The team also investigated the density of ungulates in the area, to determine whether a tiger population could be supported in the heavily forested landscape.

The report they produced was detailed. In forests near Mudubon and Sandubon, locals had observed the seasonal migration of tigers over the border between the DPRK and China, as they followed roe deer across the porous frontier.

Another villager reported spotting a female tiger accompanied by two small cubs at the foot of a cliff, likely sheltering from the wind. Two or three more were reported to have had overlapping ranges near one mountain, while another local resident, a ranger who lived in Syanyan Town in Pkhekam District, reported finding a dead tiger “with a rotten belly” the previous winter.

That same year, “a tiger appeared in a lonely peasant house.” Fear, the report said, had driven the owner mad.

When he read the report, Miquelle was skeptical. Ultimately, there was little information inside that could be verified. All they had were photos. “We were not able to confirm that any of the tracks, in the pictures that they showed us, were actually [made by] tigers,” he says.

Ultimately, the proof that the Miquelle wanted would have to been provided by a joint survey. The conservationist was hopeful that both sides could come to some form of agreement. But then, after Miquelle and his colleagues left Rajin, the North Koreans broke off communication.

“I have no idea why,” says the conservationist, still perplexed at what happened. “We never got a response when we attempted contact.”

Serious efforts at a joint field survey would not resume until 2005, this time with WWF Russia. After being handed an invitation via the Russian Academy of Sciences, the organization dispatched a trio of scientists to conduct a short survey in the forests outside Rajin and in the steppe-like landscape of the Tumen river valley. Denis Smirnov, then a coordinator of WWF-Russia’s forestry programme, was part of the team sent to North Korea.

“It was quite a short visit,” says Smirnov, comprising several official meetings and three outdoor expeditions. Snow blanketed the forest floor. “The tracks of different animals were clearly visible,” Smirnov recalls, including some the team attributed to either a leopard or a tiger.

After Miquelle and his colleagues left Rajin, the North Koreans broke off communication

“With such a short visit, it [was] unfeasible to get direct evidence,” says Smirnov. Even so, his colleague Mikhail Kretchmar considered prey density good enough for tigers to survive in the forest, and found tracks that the team attributed to either a leopard or a tiger. Interviews with local residents were also encouraging.

One forester said that he had spotted a tiger in 1998 and in the previous year the carcasses of several wild boar that could only have been mauled by “a large cat.” Another man, a hunter, testified to the presence of boar carcasses that very same year, and felt the leopards and tigers did live in the local area, albeit in low numbers.

The team left the DPRK shortly thereafter. Smirnov would visit the country again over a year later, this time to sign a memorandum of understanding, before officials from the Peoples’ Committee of Rason visited Russia to learn how the country’s system of protected reserves was managed. After that, however, any hope of further collaboration ebbed away.

Smirnov believes it had something to do with the lack of available manpower WWF Russia could have devoted to a full-scale survey; the forester spent a period of time himself overseeing four provinces after one colleague resigned. Looking back, he attributes his enthusiasm for greater involvement in North Korea to youthful exuberance.

“Probably I underestimated the possible problems… which we could meet starting work in North Korea,” Smirnov says. He does not believe, for one, that the DPRK’s institutional knowledge of Siberian tigers was sufficient to allow meaningful scientific collaboration with WWF Russia.

After three years spent navigating a maze of government bureaucracy to combat illegal logging in Laos, he also appreciates how difficult it may have been to guarantee prolonged access to the desired survey sites closer to the Sino-Russian border.

“The results of most conservation projects in Laos are very modest,” he says. “I could imagine how long it would take in North Korea to reach some solid results.”

LONELY HARBINGER

The decline of Siberian tigers on the Korean peninsula is popularly assumed to have taken place in the first half of the 20th century, roughly coincident with the Japanese occupation.

In truth, it is more likely that their numbers began to fall by the 18th century, thanks to organized extermination campaigns ordered by the Korean state. Records of the time regularly boasted of dozens, sometimes up to a hundred tigers killed in a single hunt. Given the detrimental impact the hunting and human disturbance has on the reproduction rate of big cats, it was small wonder that they quickly became endangered.

Hunting expeditions during the Japanese occupation served to depress numbers even further.

Villagers continued to look towards the state, as they always had, to defend them and their livestock against tiger attacks. Yet, by the 1930s, the only confirmed cases of the animals being captured or killed were taking place in North Hamgyong province.

It was only with the ejection of the Japanese from the peninsula in 1945 that some of the first conservation measures were enacted. In 1947, the DPRK banned any unlicensed hunts of tigers, along with bears and leopards. It was a short reprieve.

“I underestimated the possible problems… which we could meet starting work in North Korea”

Bombing campaigns by both sides in the Korean War decimated forests up and down the peninsula, severely restricting available habitat for tigers. This effectively left isolated northeast of the DPRK, close to the Sino-Soviet border, as the only plausible area where the animals might continue to survive.

One last sighting is reputed to have been made in the late 1950s by a team of Soviet and North Korean scientists in the area of Mt Paektu. Another Siberian tiger was gifted by the DPRK to the Prague Zoo in 1967, although it is possible that this animal originated from the Soviet Far East.

Thereafter, the presence of tigers on the peninsula devolved to the realm of informed speculation. In 1979, the Fauna Protection Society received a letter from a correspondent in North Korea asserting that conservation measures taken around Mt Paektu had resulted in about 50 tigers living in that area, “a considerable increase on the estimate of 10-20 when the republic was established.”

Without confirmation by international science organizations, however, the best chance of seeing a tiger on the Korean peninsula will still entail a trip to the zoo or local wildlife sanctuary.

Even if they are not currently present in the DPRK, Miquelle believes that making the border areas readily accessible to tigers could enhance the recovery of the species.

“The thing that’s important in terms of tiger conservation in this part of the world is that tiger densities are extremely low,” he explains, concurrent with the low numbers of ungulates present in what has always been, historically, the most northerly part of the species’ range. An individual Siberian tiger therefore roams over a huge area in search of prey, with males known to have territories of over 1000km.

“Korea represents another landscape where more tigers could exist.”

By demarcating new reserves in the Russian Far East and northern China, conservationists like Miquelle have successfully brought the Siberian tiger back from the brink of extinction. In his opinion, a similar recovery of the population might be possible if the North Korean government institute basic protective measures. Then, he says, “tigers will naturally move across the Tumen river back into the Korean peninsula.”

There is a small chance that they may have done so already. In 1991, tiger tracks leading from the North Korean border were discovered outside a Chinese village. In 2015, it was reported that a female with two cubs was spotted crossing the Tumen River into the DPRK from Russia by local border guards.

While the sightings are not evidence of a permanent population living on the Korean peninsula, it is certainly gratifying to think that, many years ago or yesterday, new tigers may be treading both sides of the riverbank, searching, perhaps, for a new home in an old kingdom.

0,"Asia’s hunger for sand takes a toll on endangered species

KIHIM, INDIA—As a morning mist rolls in from the Arabian Sea, young men lead a couple of dozen ox-drawn carts onto a beach south of Mumbai, India's commercial capital. Using shovels and buckets, they pile their rickety wooden transports high with sand, which they will sell to cementmakers. Altering the shoreline is illegal in India, but enforcement of coastal protection zones is lax, says Sumaira Abdulali, a local environmentalist who was beaten up after confronting ""sand miners"" near here.

Across Asia, rampant extraction of sand for construction is eroding coastlines and scouring waterways. ""For a resource we think is infinite, we are beginning to realize that it's not,"" says Aurora Torres, an ecologist at the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research in Leipzig. ""It's a global concern, but especially acute in Asia, where all trends show that urbanization and the region's big construction boom are going to continue for many years."" And it is taking an environmental toll that scientists are beginning to assess—and environmentalists hope to reduce.

Already, scientists have linked poorly regulated and often illegal sand removal to declines in seagrasses in Indonesia and in charismatic species such as the Ganges River dolphin and terrapins in India and Malaysia. In eastern China's Poyang Lake, dredging boats are sucking up tens of millions of tons of sand a year, altering the hydrology of the country's largest freshwater lake, a way station for migratory birds. Conservation groups are urging governments to crack down. But the political clout of developers means it will be an uphill—and perilous—battle. Last September, for example, two activists with Mother Nature Cambodia who were filming illegal sand dredging off the Cambodian coast were arrested and convicted of ""violation of privacy."" They spent several months in jail before being released last month.

Used to make concrete and glass, sand is an essential ingredient of nearly every modern highway, airport, dam, windowpane, and solar panel. Although desert sand is plentiful, its wind-tumbled particles are too smooth—and therefore not cohesive enough—for construction material. Instead, builders prize sand from quarries, coastlines, and riverbeds. ""The very best sand for construction is river sand; it's the right particle size and shape,"" says David Shankman, professor emeritus of geography at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, who studies the hydrology of Poyang Lake, a repository of sand deposited by Yangtze River tributaries.

Between 1994 and 2012, global cement production—a proxy for concrete use—tripled, from 1.37 billion to 3.7 billion tons, driven largely by Asian construction, according to a 2014 report from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Land reclamation projects, too, have a rapacious hunger for sand. Singapore, for example, has expanded its land area by 22% using sand primarily from Malaysia, Cambodia, and Indonesia as fill. All told, UNEP warned, sand mining—on an industrial scale and by individual operators—""greatly exceeds natural renewal rates"" and ""is increasing exponentially.""

Scientists are now tracing the collateral damage. In a paper under review at Science of the Total Environment , Richard Unsworth, an ecologist at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, and colleagues explain how sand mining has driven declines of seagrass meadows off of Indonesia. Sediment plumes stirred up by the dredging block sunlight, impeding photosynthesis, his team has found. The meadows nourish several species, including the dugong, which is in decline. ""If they lose their food source, the dugong could eventually be goners,"" Unsworth says.

Another sand mining victim is the southern river terrapin, a critically endangered turtle in Southeast Asia. Every year, Chen Pelf Nyok, a biologist with the Turtle Conservation Society of Malaysia in Kemaman, spends a few weeks patrolling sandy beaches near Malaysia's Kemaman River during the terrapin's brief egg-laying season; her team collects and incubates eggs to protect them from poachers. Three years ago, sand mining erased a nesting site they had monitored. ""Terrapin habitat cannot be easily replaced,"" Chen says, because female turtles return each year to lay eggs at the same beaches.

Also under siege, in Bangladesh and India, is the northern river terrapin. ""Sand mining is one of the biggest problems and reasons why they are so endangered today,"" says Peter Praschag, a biologist at the Conservation Breeding and Research Center for Turtles in Graz, Austria. ""When the sand banks are gone, the [terrapin] is gone."" Other creatures directly affected by river sand mining, scientists say, are the gharial—a rare crocodile found in northern India—and the Ganges River dolphin.

Poyang Lake, a key wintering ground on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, hosts dozens of migratory species, including almost all of the 4000 or so surviving Siberian cranes. But sand dredging campaigns in the middle Yangtze Basin have expanded rapidly since the early 2000s, when such activities were banned on sections of the lower Yangtze. ""Sand mining has significantly lowered the water level, especially in winter,"" says Lai Xijun, an environmental hydrologist at the Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology in China. Falling lake levels can curtail the birds' access to aquatic vegetation. And when lake bottom mud dries and hardens, the birds may not be able to pluck out nutritious tubers.

In grasslands near Poyang, the kind and amount of food the cranes consume ""may no longer be enough to fuel egg laying"" at the levels the birds managed in the past, says James Burnham, a conservation biologist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. His group has documented a worrisome decline in the ratio of juvenile cranes to adults at Poyang between 2010 and 2012.

Scientists in China are calling on the government to curtail sand mining across the entirety of the Yangtze Basin. In a letter to Nature last October, Yushun Chen of the Institute of Hydrobiology in Wuhan, China, and colleagues argued that sand mining there ""has destroyed crucial spawning, feeding and rearing grounds for its aquatic organisms,"" including the now-extinct Yangtze river dolphin and the endangered Yangtze finless porpoise. ""We appeal to the Chinese government to clamp down on this wholesale destruction of aquatic organisms' habitat,"" they wrote.

""We are not saying we need to stop sand mining altogether. We are saying we need to minimize the impacts,"" says Jack Liu, a biologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing who is spearheading an effort to assemble a comprehensive picture of the damage. Construction standards should be raised to extend building longevity, he says, and building materials should be recycled. Those sand grains on the beach may not be innumerable after all.",Asia’s hunger for sand takes a toll on endangered species,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VtYWcub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxOC8wMy9hc2lhcy1odW5nZXItc2FuZC10YWtlcy10b2xsLWVuZGFuZ2VyZWQtc3BlY2llc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/ca_0302NID_Sand_Mining_online.jpg?itok=DAvtfs1x,2018-03-01,"{'sent': 'Asia’s hunger for sand takes a toll on endangered species\n\nKIHIM, INDIA—', 'ents': {'ORG': ['INDIA', 'KIHIM']}}",Gharial

MULTAN: Punjab Wildlife Department is executing a plan worth Rs109.162 million to establish Dolphin Rescue Centres along River Indus to save Pakistan’s blind dolphins, the second most endangered freshwater dolphin species in the world.

Divisional Wildlife Officer Sajjad Hussain said the project was initiated in July 2017 and is expected to complete by June 30, 2020. “The centres will be established in important areas along Indus waterway from Chashma Barrage to Indus River in Rajanpur,” he added.

He said separate Blind Dolphin information centres of WWF and Punjab Wildlife Department were already working at Taunsa Barrage and the new initiative was an attempt to step up efforts to save the endangered specie.

He maintained work on Dolphin Rescue Centre at Chashma Barrage in Mianwali was already in progress.

Sajjad pointed out these centres would be built in other districts, including Bhakkar, Layyah, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.

The wildlife officer said that suitable sites had been selected for setting up rescue centres in DG Khan, Layyah and Rajanpur districts while requests were sent to Board of Revenue through respective district governments for land acquisition.

These sites were located within 10 kilometre range from River Indus bank in each district, he said.

He said for the purpose, an amount of Rs20 million was released, including Rs14 million to buildings department of the respective districts and Rs6 million to the wildlife department during the ongoing fiscal year.

The Indus River dolphin is known as the second-most endangered freshwater species in the world and listed among the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s threatened species.

Locally called Bhulan, the blind dolphins are confronting multiple threats which range from reduction in freshwater flows to pollution and harmful fishing practices in the Indus River. Dr Gillian T Braulik, a dolphin conservation expert and member of the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group, said an 80% decline has been witnessed in its distribution range and habitat due to the construction of barrages and water diversions for agriculture purposes.

Although the dolphin population is confronting different threats, a recent population survey led by the WWF-Pakistan shows an increase in the number of dolphins across its population range in the Indus River. The preliminary results of the study survey titled ‘Signs of hope for the endemic and endangered Bhulan’ reveal that a total of 1,816 dolphins were counted during an assessment conducted between 20th March and 13th April 2017. The dolphin encounter rate was higher, ie, 1,075 in the downstream Indus River with the highest population observed between Guddu and Sukkur barrages in Sindh.

It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.

Behavior and Habitat

Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wet—just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.

Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers.

Breeding and Population

Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces at birth and cannot crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white, and develop their much loved coloring later.",National Geographic,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vYW5pbWFscy9tYW1tYWxzL2cvZ2lhbnQtcGFuZGEv0gFYaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkubmF0aW9uYWxnZW9ncmFwaGljLmNvbS9kaXN0cmlidXRpb24vcHVibGljL2FtcC9hbmltYWxzL21hbW1hbHMvZy9naWFudC1wYW5kYQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/thumbs/rights-exempt/mammals/g/giant-panda_thumb.ngsversion.1474903817550.adapt.1900.1.JPG,2018-03-15,"{'sent': 'A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of every 24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times a day.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['12', 'dozens', 'half']}}",Giant White Panda
0,"Panna National Park was set up in 1981, and thereafter has been accredited as a recognized ‘reserve’ under the Government’s 1994 Project Tiger initiative. Situated in the state of Madhya Pradesh, Panna has been an abode for the iconic tigers. The presence of the Ken River meandering across the landscape has given a boost not only to preserving tigers but also to preserving many diverse species of fauna and flora.

In 2009, Panna lost all its tigers to systematic poaching. Eight years since their disappearance tigers have been reintroduced to this forest from the neighboring national parks at great cost. Not only have they been reintroduced but their population has flourished. Tracking tigers in parks spread over several hectares of dense forests has been a challenging task – involving high expenditures on forming teams, training forest guards and rehabilitating indigenous tribes living within the boundaries of the demarcated area.

Onset of man-made projects

As this tiger reserve recuperates from poaching, it faces new threats of diamond quarrying and the Ken-Betwa river linkage project. The Daudhan dam project is intended to assuage the drought -inflicted region of Bundelkhand as well as other regions of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. However, the habitat of India’s endangered national animal is at stake.

Consequences

Forests are known to be reservoirs of oxygen and sinks of carbon since trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Rapid industrialization over the past few decades has resulted in forests absorbing as much as thirty percent of the Earth’s anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Cutting down trees in a belt of prime biodiversity would only increase the ill-effects attached to climate change.

Diamond quarrying in the wildlife conservation area has been a persistent threat. A recent report by the Centre for Science and Environment shows that Panna is the only producer of diamonds in the country, accounting for 31.5% of Indian diamond deposits. The Supreme Court of India by an order passed in 2005 shut down the Majhgaon mines located on the periphery of the park since the mines posed an imminent threat to the vicinity’s biodiversity.

The order of the Supreme Court had little positive outcome, since diamonds have been illegally sold and smuggled out of the reserve. There exist over 3000 illegal diamond quarries, while licenses were allotted to 1339 shallow mines. These unchecked mining activities have had a negative impact on ancient rock paintings of the pre-Gupta era Chandramukh temple. The global mining giant, Rio Tinto, has agreed to invest 2,200 crores into quarrying diamonds in the tiger corridor.

While mining poses a significant threat to the diverse species of plants and animals of the region, it would be secondary to the destruction that the river linking project would cause. Before implementing such projects, a careful and detailed analysis is necessary: Only two percent of India’s landmass is allocated for tiger conservation. While the present government states that the tiger is a barometer of the country’s ecological health and wealth, at the same time it allows a project that would have drastic consequences on the tiger’s habitat.

The river linking project would enable the construction of the Daudhan dam in the centre of the core forest area, encroaching upon prime tiger territory. While the committee set up to study this project advised the government against it, clearances to proceed with the construction are being granted rapidly. since Panna has taken a significant amount of time to recover from the loss of its tigers, such a project would be a debacle. This multi-crore irrigation project would submerge the very land from which villages and local tribes were relocated to make way for the tiger.

The various clearances received as well as the EIA report suggest that the government is wholly inclined towards building the dam. The Standing Committee of the National Wildlife Board (NWF) has granted all the required permissions. Since the NWF has been set up to implement wildlife friendly programs, it is hard to comprehend how submerging the core zone of the national park would be beneficial to the wildlife at Panna.

The dam would be 74 metres high, requiring massive amounts of cement, resulting in the emission of significant quantity of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Organic material and sediments that are usually washed downstream by river currents would stagnate. In a national park with dense foliage and numerous species of animals, terrestrial as well as aquatic, the organic material collected would release substantial amounts of methane gas.

The Indian Gharial, the most critically endangered reptile species in India, is endemic to the Ken river. Significant numbers of gharials have fallen prey to the toxins released into the Yamuna. Panna is one of the few places where this species has thrived. The dam would endanger their survival by submerging their nesting sites and the many islets that they use for exposure to sunlight. The dam would also destroy fisheries that the gharials consume.

Conclusion

India’s Panna Tiger Reserve may not survive. Tigers and other endangered species would be lost if the Ken-Betwa river linking project and Daudhan dam construction are implemented. Huge financial and ecological costs would be incurred. There are numerous cost-effective alternatives, such as rainwater harvesting and revival of old village tanks, that could eliminate the environmental hazards posed by this project.

Territories extending outside the national park should be brought within its confines to compensate for what would be lost. Since a high-walled dam would not only submerge tiger habitat but also destroy innumerable bird nests, the height must be shortened. As explained above, the ideal outcome would be to abandon both the river linking and the dam.",Preserving Panna’s tigers,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2Jsb2dzL3ZvaWNlcy9wcmVzZXJ2aW5nLXBhbm5hcy10aWdlcnMv0gFKaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYmxvZ3Mvdm9pY2VzL3ByZXNlcnZpbmctcGFubmFzLXRpZ2Vycy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.toiimg.com/photo/75433510.cms,2018-03-28,"{'sent': 'Panna National Park was set up in 1981, and thereafter has been accredited as a recognized ‘reserve’ under the Government’s 1994 Project Tiger initiative.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Panna National Park'], 'ORG': ['Project Tiger']}}",Tiger
0,"The Indian gharial (Gavialis Gangeticus) is one nature's most curious creations. A close relative of the mugger crocodile abundantly found in Indian rivers, this fish-eating reptile has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list for decades due to its rapidly declining population.

Once found in abundance in all rivers of India, the gharial is now limited to just a few rivers and even the Ganga - after which this reptile has been named - does not have more than a few hundred of them living in it.

However, due to extensive conservation efforts by wildlife departments in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and the relatively undisturbed riverine ecosystem of the Chambal which passes through these three states, gharial numbers have reached over 1,680 in the Chambal Sanctuary area.

For the first time in over 39 years since 1979 (when the gharial conservation mission began in Chambal) an increase of 426 gharials has been registered in a year. This has left wildlife authorities of all three states hopeful. In fact, this is the first year that an increase of over 100 gharials has been registered in this region.

Amit Sisodia, the ranger of Bah area, told India Today that data collected through a joint survey has encouraged the wildlife department as efforts put in by wildlife employees are finally starting to pay off.

Girjesh Tiwari, the ranger of Etawah, said the world started to question the competence of Indian wildlife experts when over 100 gharials had died suddenly in 2008 and even the gharial conservation project had come under question. But since then, gharial numbers have been on the rise and this year it has reached 1,681 - a record. Last year, this number was 1,255.

Sisodia said the survey also showed an increase in the numbers of 36 species of migratory birds - an indicator of the success of conservation efforts made by local wildlife authorities. The number of birds in the sanctuary area has crossed 22,000. This includes 11,500 migratory birds and 466 Indian skimmers.

The survey also found that the number of mugger crocodiles has increased to 613 in the Bah region of Chambal. It was just 562 last year. In 2014 this number was 390, in 2015 it was 402, while in 2016 it was 464.

The number of dolphins has remained more or less constant in the area. Last year, their population was 75, while this year it was registered as 74. The wildlife department is now making efforts to make sure the number of dolphins also starts to increase.

Environmentalist Bhagwan Singh said that sand mining on the banks of Chambal have caused a lot of damage to the environment as the eggs of turtles, gharials and Muggers were destroyed as a result of the mining.

With the wildlife department banning sand mining in Chambal with the cooperation of local authorities as well as the starting of Chambal Safari to attract tourists to the region, hopes have come alive that this river will once again be filled with the aquatic fauna it was once famous for.

0,"For a long time, zoologists assumed that there were only two species of elephant: one Asian and one African. Then genetic analyses suggested that the African Elephant could be divided into two distinct species, the African Forest and African Savannah elephants.

Now a new elephant has been added to the mix. The palaeoloxodan antiquus has been extinct for 120 000 years. This elephant roamed Europe and western Asia during the last ice age, about 400 000 years ago. A study of its DNA shows that this supposedly European animal is actually the African forest elephants’ closest relative. Another study by the same team found that at a genetic level, it may even have more in common with the modern African forest elephant than the African savannah elephant.

This study changes everything we thought we knew about the evolutionary history and ancestry of modern elephants and their closest relatives. It also shows that the African elephant’s lineage was not confined to Africa; the animals actually went out of the continent, which we didn’t know before. It roamed Europe and – through a lot of interbreeding – left its genetic mark far from its original stomping grounds.

The new find, based on DNA from fossils found in Germany, may also shed light on a DNA discrepancy that has puzzled scientists for some time.

The evolution of elephants

Palaeoloxodon antiquus is known as the straight-tusked elephant because of its distinctive and somewhat bizarre appearance. Its ancestors, the Palaeoloxodon recki, lived in Africa between 3.5 millon and 100 000 years ago. Fossils show that the straight-tusked elephants arrived in Eurasia around 750 000 years ago and that they left Africa through the Middle East.

Julien Benoit

Once it reached Europe, the Palaeoloxodon antiquus had to adapt to new conditions. One of its new homes was the island of Sicily and, as is common when large animals settle on an island, it evolved into a dwarf species. This is a way for large animals to deal with the paucity of resources common on islands.

My own research on this dwarf elephant, Palaeoloxodon falconeri has shown that this remarkable species had an exceptionally large brain. In fact, it’s the only animal species ever recorded with a brain size comparable to a human’s.

There’s a problem, though: DNA revealed some years ago that the Palaeoloxodon falconeri wasn’t descended from or related to any of the African elephant species as expected. Its closest relative was actually the Asian elephant.

That made no sense. How could the straight-tusked elephant be related to African elephants and its dwarf descendant be related to Asian elephants? Was that study wrong? The new study, which examined Palaeoloxodon antiquus DNA, could help unravel the mystery.

This is because the Palaeoloxodon antiquus’ DNA appears to be a mixture of many species’ DNA, which would have happened when they interbred. This process, known as admixture, probably occurred once Palaeoloxodon left Africa. That’s how its descendents ended up with Asian elephant DNA, and even DNA from the famous woolly mammoth.

It is possible that a small chunk of the dwarf elephant’s DNA analysed years ago was extracted from a fragment of sequence inherited from the Asian elephant – and its other origins weren’t picked up.

DNA speaks

This new information about elephants’ evolution and history is extremely exciting. It shows that the two modern African elephant species are heirs of a glorious and evolutionary successful past which still survives and speaks through their DNA. Conservation efforts therefore do not only preserve species, they also save the genetic memories of these peaceful giants.",Ancient DNA changes everything we know about the evolution of elephants,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPvJcAPfXWPs28uham338vgqGQgEKhAIACoHCAownPqBCzCkqv4CMOHI8QU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images.theconversation.com/files/213141/original/file-20180404-189824-1h993o7.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2018-04-08,"{'sent': 'For a long time, zoologists assumed that there were only two species of elephant: one Asian and one African.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['only two', 'one']}}",Elephant

The Mary River turtle (Elusor macrurus) has a head crowned by vertical strands of algae that also grow on its body.

In addition, it sports face furniture in the form of long fleshy barbels under its chin.

However, perhaps the Mary River turtle’s most unusual feature is its ability to breathe through its genitals.

The turtle has gill-like organs within its cloaca – a multi-purpose orifice used by reptiles for excretion and mating – that allow it to stay underwater for up to three days.

The turtle, which measures up to 40 cm, lives in just one location – the Mary River in Queensland, Australia.

Its docile nature – more hippy than punk – historically made it a popular pet. In the 1960s and 1970s its nest sites were mercilessly pillaged for the pet trade.

Today, the Mary River turtle is one of the world’s most endangered turtle species.

The turtle is just one of many weird and wonderful species featured in the Zoological Society of London (ZSL’s) Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (Edge) Reptiles list.

The Kukrail gharial breeding centre in Lucknow alone houses around 300 gharials -- once considered to be the total population of the crocodilian in the country. And there are still eggs left for new ones to make an appearance.

“We have 300 gharials with us. But this figure represents only what is left after hundreds were sent for breeding to different places over the years,” said Ashok Prasad Sinha, conservator of forest endangered species project, Uttar Pradesh forest department.

The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), also known as gavial or fish-eating crocodile, is a type of Asian crocodilian set apart by its long and thin snout. It is different from the crocodile or the alligator, which exist in bigger numbers. It is native to the northern part of the Indian subcontinent.

The jaws of the gharial are too thin and delicate to grab a larger prey. They keep lying in wait for fishes to swim by and then quickly catch them by whipping their heads sideways. They do not chew their prey, but swallow it.

Sinha said that the Kukrail centre is responsible for sending gharials for breeding to places like Madhya Pradesh and Chennai in Tamil Nadu. “In all, 238 gharials were sent to Delhi, Rampur, Bijnor, Etah, Mathura and Kanpur. Thirty-one gharials were also sent to other countries, including Bhutan, the US (New York), Pakistan and China,” he shared.

The latest batches of 116 gharials left the centre for the natural habitat of Kartania forest range on March 15 and 29. “We are happy that even after sending so many, we still have 300 gharials left.

Mumbai, May 3: The Punjab government in first of its kind has decided to conduct an organised census of Indus River Dolphins, one of the rarest species. The reason behind carrying out this census is to plan the conservation of this endangered species. The Punjab government along with (World Wildlife Fund) WWF-India has decided to conduct the activity for over a period of five days. Previously, the researchers had merely spotted the dolphins.

According to the officials from the Department of Forests and Wildlife Preservation, Punjab and WWF-India would be working in two teams to estimate the population of the dolphins.

According to the previous study, this dolphin species are found only in India and Pakistan, confined to the 185 km stretch between Talwara and Harike Barrage in India's Beas River in Punjab, one of the five rivers flowing under Indus river system. “We are trying to establish their near accurate population as to plan their conservation accordingly. It is the first organised census, and previously we had merely spotted them,” Kuldeep Kumar, Chief Wildlife Warden, Punjab told IANS.

Suresh Babu, Director River Wetland and Water Policy, WWF-India said that the most flourishing population of the Indus dolphin, platanista gangetica minor (South Asian river dolphin) is found across Pakistan wherein their numbers are estimated to be around 1,800 over a stretch of 1,500 km of the Indus river.

Babu further stated dolphins are a key indicator of river health- if a river is healthy the dolphins will be there and if not, we have the example of Sutlej.” Experts claimed in Sutlej river, decades back they were dolphins found. However, river pollution is believed to be a significant cause of their extinction from the habitat.",Dolphins in India: Punjab Government to Conduct First Organised Census of Indus River Dolphins,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiELA_l8G6awr0JWC9sJpDVQgqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow7IeCCzDox_4CMOK48gU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dolphin-pixabay-781x441.jpg,2018-05-03,"{'sent': 'Mumbai, May 3: The Punjab government in first of its kind has decided to conduct an organised census of Indus River Dolphins, one of the rarest species.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Mumbai'], 'PERSON': ['Punjab']}}",Indus River Dolphin

There are between five and 11 Indus river dolphins in the 185-km stretch of the Beas that flows through Punjab, but the sighting of young calves, however, signalled a breeding population and hope for revival, according to the first organised survey by World Wildlife Federation-India and the state’s department of Punjab.

This subspecies of the South Asian River Dolphin was once found in the major tributaries of the Indus that flow through India, but is now found only in Beas, the survey, which was released on Wednesday, explained.

“Ultimately the aim is to dev- elop a conservation strategy for Indus river dolphins,” said Sur- esh Babu, director, rivers, wetlands and water policy at WWF-India. “ It is a small population,we need to ensure adequate environmental flow for the river and dolphin and protect their prey base.”

“The exciting thing was that we found few weeks-old calves, indicating it is a breeding population,” he added. The Indus river dolphin (Platanista gangetica ssp. minor) is a subspecies of the South Asian River Dolphin, wh- ich includes the Gangetic river dolphin. The subspecies is endangered and is placed in Schedule I of India’s Wildlife Protection Act.

The Indus river dolphin is the national marine mammal of Pakistan and the Gangetic dolphin is the national aquatic animal of India. “The threats faced by the Gangetic river dolphin and the Indus river dolphin are different because the population of Indus river dolphins is small and isolated. An accident can wipe out the entire population,” said Qamar Qureshi, a scientist at Wildlife Institute of India.

The South Asian River Dolph- ins are also called the blind river dolphins because they don’t have functional sight, and navigate and catch prey through echolocation using a biological sonar.

There are only four dolphin sp- ecies that live in freshwater. The Indus river dolphin is believed to have emerged after the Tethys Sea dried up they were compelled to adapt to and live in rivers.

Traditionally, the dolphins were found in the mainstem of the Indus and its five tributaries Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum. But it’s range reduced by almost 80% compared to the late 1800s, with the Indian population limited to Beas.

Since the Beas is circumscribed by the Pong Dam in Himachal Pradesh and the Harike barrage in Punjab, this population is isolated from members in Indus in Pakistan, where their number is about 1,800. A step to protect the habitat was taken last year, when the Beas stretch in Punjab was declared a conservation reserve, with a ban on commercial fishing, netting or hunting.",Endangered Indus river dolphins see hope in Beas,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9pbmRpYS1uZXdzL2VuZGFuZ2VyZWQtaW5kdXMtcml2ZXItZG9scGhpbnMtc2VlLWhvcGUtaW4tYmVhcy9zdG9yeS1La1gweDZlQnlsVWRTUEdzUVZaN21JLmh0bWzSAX5odHRwczovL20uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2luZGlhLW5ld3MvZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1pbmR1cy1yaXZlci1kb2xwaGlucy1zZWUtaG9wZS1pbi1iZWFzL3N0b3J5LUtrWDB4NmVCeWxVZFNQR3NRVlo3bUlfYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/05/09/Pictures/_702792b0-53ab-11e8-ae13-d985d3701f4e.jpg,2018-05-09,"{'sent': 'india\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['india']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"An escalation in the number of conflicts across the Sahara and the Sahel in Africa is driving down numbers of the region’s wildlife, a new study finds.

The authors found that the number of conflicts in the region has risen by 565 percent since 2011.

At the same time, 12 species of vertebrate have either gone extinct or are much closer to extinction as a result of conflicts in the region.

The surge in armed conflicts across the Sahara Desert and the band of dry savanna to its south called the Sahel is devastating the region’s wildlife, according to recent findings published in the journal Conservation Letters.

“As if the harsh, arid landscape isn’t enough, the growth of armed conflict in the Sahara-Sahel region is yet another serious threat that wildlife in this critical region now have to contend with,” biologist Sarah Durant of the Zoological Society of London, an author of the study, said in a statement.

The rise of groups like Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, and Boko Haram over the past few years have destabilized Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Mali. These are some of the least-developed countries on Earth, and they’re adjacent to countries like Libya where power vacuums have recently emerged, contributing to the problem. Across the Sahel and Sahara, the number of conflicts has swelled by 565 percent since 2011, the authors report. That means one in five conflicts on the African continent is taking place in this region, and its disputes account for 5 percent of the global total.

Research published in the journal Nature in early 2018 found that, in general, wildlife numbers decline across the continent as the number of conflicts rises. In this case, the study’s authors wanted to understand what the rapid uptick in violence would mean for this region’s unique and threatened wildlife populations.

“Areas where fauna is seriously endangered due to the rise in conflicts need to be identified, and effective policies need to be implemented in order to reduce the impact of these conflicts on biodiversity,” ecologist José Carlos Brito said in a statement from the University of Granada. Brito is the paper’s lead author, and he works at the University of Porto in Portugal, one of 20 institutions involved in the project.

The team compiled data on the locations of battles, explosions and attacks throughout the region, as well as the paths used by smugglers and people migrating through the Sahara and Sahel. They then compared that information with the results of surveys of 10 species of vertebrates that live in the region. They zeroed in on three species: the addax, or white antelope (Addax nasomaculatus); the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas); and the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana).

The addax, an antelope that lives primarily in northern Niger, is down to “critically low numbers” in connection with rising conflict and oil exploration in the region over the past 20 years. Shortly after the fall of the Moammar Gadhafi regime in Libya in 2011, illegal hunters began killing more dorcas gazelles in the predominantly desert country. And the poaching of Mali’s elephants spiked in 2015 in the wake of several years of violence and failed peace processes there.

The scientists figure that 12 of the 14 species of large animal that live in this area have either gone extinct or are perilously close to it because of the region’s conflicts.

The team recommends conservation measures should be included in peace deals, along with penalties for groups and governments that don’t abide by them, to address these issues. They also suggest that curbing the number of weapons that flow into the region could help reduce the loss of wildlife in the Sahel and the Sahara.

“There’s a vicious circle connecting arms trafficking, conflicts, migration and the extinction of animal species,” the authors said in the statement from the University of Granada.

Recognizing this cycle, as well as the role that a balance of conservation and economic development must play, should be part of the long-term strategy to tackle this problem, the researchers argue.

And there’s little time to spare: “Such steps need to be taken now, before the unique and iconic biodiversity of the world’s largest desert is lost,” they write in the paper.

0,"The first ever organised survey of the endangered Indus River Dolphin species in Beas River, Punjab, has revealed that an estimated five to eleven individuals are found along the 185kms-long Beas Conservation Reserve. The population estimation was carried out jointly by the Forest and Wildlife Department of Punjab government and World Wildlife Fund – India, between May 3 and May 6.

Indus River Dolphins are not found in abundance in India, as opposed to over 1,800 estimated to be found accros the border in Pakistan. But, WWF-India said that despite its small population, the presence of 5-11 individuals indicates no decline in their population. In fact, a young calf was also spotted during the survey which indicated that the population was large enough to be viable, WWF-India said.

The survey was led by Gill Braulik, a specialist in the field of Indus Dolphin conservation and member of International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Cetacean specialist group. A direct count methodology was used to estimate the dolphin population and barring a 55km stretch of Beas, it was carried out using boats.

""The dolphin survey started from 52 headworks, Talwara on May 3 and ended at Harike Nooze point on May 6. However, the 55 kilometre of river downstream of 52 headworks was surveyed by road due to insufficient water in the River Beas while the remaining 130 kilometre was surveyed using motorboats,"" a WWF-India release said.

""We were a total of 12 surveyors in two boats and both boats moved at the same speed to prevent double counting,"" said Suresh Babu, Director-Rivers, Wetlands and Water Policy, WWF India. Kuldip Kumar, Chief Wildlife Warden Punjab, Mr Neeraj Gupta, Divisional Forest Officer and Gitanjali Kanwar, senior project officer, WWF-India, comprised of the team along with Babu. Kuldip Kumar could not be reached for a comment despite repeated attempts.

Babu added that a long-term strategy was required to conserve the freshwater sub-species of Gangetic dolphins. ""First and foremost, a continuous minimum ecological flow in Beas is most important for dolphins. The prey base needs to be enhanced for their survival and we need to also engage the local community to conserve them,"" said Babu

The Beas Conservation Reserve is also home to otters and ghariyals that were reintroduced in Beas six decades after their extinction.

After a search for three days since the spill of molasses from a sugar mill in Gurdaspur killed aquatic animals in the Beas, a team of Punjab’s forest and wildlife department finally sighted a dolphin in the river stretch at Karmuwala near the Harike headworks on Saturday evening.

Mahavir Singh, conservator (wildlife), confirmed the sighting: “A glimmer of hope has emerged that they are all safe.” There are between five and 11 Indus river dolphins in the 185-km stretch of the Beas that flows through Punjab, according to the first organised survey by World Wildlife Federation-India and the state department whose report came out earlier this month. “The health of the dolphin sighted was reported as normal by the team,” the officer further said. Photographic evidence was not immediately available.

Since the leak from Chadha Sugar Mill at Kiri Afgana village killed hundreds of fish, teams were fielded by the department in collaboration with WWF-India to check on dolphins and gharials. Some of the gharials — the river has 47 in all — were already sighted, but worries over the dolphins, among the rare species in the river, remained.

Further, Geetanjali Kanwar, coordinator for the WWF team, said they found the movement of the dolphin was fine, and the survey will conducted further to ascertain the exact condition of the animals. Earlier in the day, Mahavir said, “Had the dolphins died, the bodies would have been seen floating on the surface. It is a tough task to sight them anyway.”

He added that a final report of the survey and the autopsy of the dead fish would come on Monday. It should be able to suggest the fate of the species in the water, he added.

Report filed in court

Also, the forest department on Saturday directly submitted the damage report on details of habitat loss caused by the spill of molasses into the Beas river, at the local court of Batala in Gurdaspur district.

The department prepared the report on Friday under the Wildlife Protection Act, and officials stayed in the court complex throughout the day but failed to file it in the court as the district attorney was busy. On Saturday too, they could not file it through the district attorney and submitted it directly instead. Confirming, district forest officer (Gurdaspur) Rajesh Mahajan said they have been told the report will be considered on Monday. The report is equivalent to a first information report (FIR) as is registered by the police. The mill management has said the leak was an accident.

‘Mill used to release fluid in river earlier too’

Further, on Saturday, Sushil Kumar, a fish contractor, said he had lodged a complaint to the department of fisheries on April 6 this year against the Gurdaspur sugar mill as it “used to spill acidic fluid into Beas river that caused me loss of lakhs of rupees”. A resident of Qadian, Kumar said the complaint was addressed to assistant director of the department at Hoshiarpur, “but no action was taken”. He also sought compensation from the government.

When contacted, Kulwinder Singh, the assistant director, said, “After the complaint, our team visited the site of the mill in the presence of the contractor, but found no such practice there”.

“This is a false allegations as our mill does not indulge any such activity,” said Munish Pal, the mill unit head.","After killer spill, dolphin finally sighted in Beas river in Punjab",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vcHVuamFiL2FmdGVyLWtpbGxlci1zcGlsbC1kb2xwaGluLWZpbmFsbHktc2lnaHRlZC1pbi1iZWFzLXJpdmVyLWluLXB1bmphYi9zdG9yeS1TUHBFdWtoMk0wUlhpdUE5QXdUSDJILmh0bWzSAYwBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9wdW5qYWIvYWZ0ZXIta2lsbGVyLXNwaWxsLWRvbHBoaW4tZmluYWxseS1zaWdodGVkLWluLWJlYXMtcml2ZXItaW4tcHVuamFiL3N0b3J5LVNQcEV1a2gyTTBSWGl1QTlBd1RIMkhfYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/05/19/Pictures/_d94f1278-5b75-11e8-b431-73159b4b09e2.jpg,2018-05-19,"{'sent': 'punjab\n\nUpdated: May 20, 2018 10:16 IST\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['punjab']}}",Gharial

It was the first discovered side-swimming cetacean and is functionally blind, which is why it is also known as the Indus blind dolphin. It navigates and hunts its prey using a biological sonar for echolocation.

In India, this dolphin used to be found in the major tributaries of the Indus river but is now found only found in the Beas river in Punjab. Recently, Punjab’s wildlife wing, in association with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), India conducted their first ever Indus Dolphin census and the numbers are reassuring.

“Based on the direct counts, after correcting for dolphins that were missed by the survey, the final estimate of the population of Indus river dolphins in the Beas River stands at 5-11,” says a report by the WWF India.

The number seems too less to be happy about. However, WWF clears this misunderstanding, saying “Although the population of the species is small, its presence in the Beas river above the Harike barrage (situated at the confluence of Beas and Sutlej) for 70 years, indicates no decline in the population of the species.”

In fact, an adult female, a week-old calf, and a sub-adult were among the first few dolphins sighted. Just 8 kilometres downstream from this first sighting was another female with a sub-adult and a week-old calf. This shows that Beas river has been a healthy breeding ground for the Indus dolphins.

Villagers living downstream along the Beas river from Kiri Afgana village in Punjab’s Gurdaspur district woke up on May 17 to a sight they had never seen before.

Thousands of fish of all sizes were turning dead up along the river banks. The villagers immediately took the fish and put them in buckets and tubs of water, local forest department official Karm Singh said.

The locals knew from experience that the fish could be revived if released back into water even after half an hour out of the river. They hoped that the river water that had turned a dark rusty colour overnight and stank of alcohol would flow away allowing them to return the fish to the river. They waited but the water cleared only after two days.

A chemical reaction inside the molasses storage tank of a sugar mill owned by Chadha Sugar Industries Private Limited at Kiri Afgana released thousands of litres of molasses into the main stem of the Beas late on May 16.

Among the creatures that were affected were the Indus river dolphin, one of the India’s rarest mammals. The Indus river dolphin (Platanista gangetica ssp minor) is a subspecies of the South Asian River Dolphin, which includes the Gangetic river dolphin. Both the subspecies are threatened and protected under Schedule I of India’s Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

A WWF team and forest department officials had been tracking the precarious return of the Indus River dolphins to the Beas about a decade ago after they were believed to have become locally extinct. Their return to the Beas was reported and confirmed in 2007 but their population was less than a dozen.

A small isolated population like this is at greater risk of local extinction, according to experts.

When Gitanjali Kanwar heard the news of the leak her heart sank.

“The immediate effect was plunging pH levels, turning the water acidic and the loss of dissolved oxygen,” Kanwar, a WWF India field researcher who has studied this riverine system for close to a decade, said.

The WWF team had announced earlier in May that a healthy population of about five to eleven dolphins inhabited the stretch of the river between Pong dam in Himachal Pradesh and Harike barrage in Punjab. During the survey held between May 3 and 6, the presence of a calf suggesting a breeding population was big news.

But the ugly disaster threatened to wipe the Indus river dolphins off the face of India.

“It felt like losing a close family member,” Kanwar said recalling her first reaction to the news of the leak.

Apart from turning the stretch of water acidic, the molasses also ate up the dissolved oxygen. Like humans, fish require oxygen to live, which they absorb directly from the water using their gills. When the oxygen dries up, a fish usually comes to the surface to breathe in the air from its mouth. This works for only for a short time as it is not what fish are made for and so they suffocate and die.

The only glimmer of hope for the conservationists was that dolphins do not breathe using gills but oxygen in the atmosphere from the blowhole located on top of their heads.

The loss of dissolved oxygen in the river water didn’t cut off the dolphin’s oxygen supply but whether they survived the acidic polluted water remained a torturous mystery. A survey team of WWF and forest personnel searched in vain for two days after the leak for any signs of the dolphins and during that period they thought the endangered species was lost again.

Forest official Singh glimpsed a dolphin near Karmuwala village on the third day after a disappointing morning of spotting nothing and then mistaking a floating dead cow for a dolphin.

What Singh spotted was an adult female and a few heart-stopping moments later a calf emerged in a graceful arc from the waters. On Sunday, they found a group of three.

“All of us heaved a sigh of relief,” he recalled.

Experts are still trying to find out how the dolphins remained unscathed from the acidic water.

WWF’s Kanwar believes that when faced with the torrent of foul polluted water the dolphins scurried to find cleaner side channels of the river. Since the pollutants followed the path of the river flow the side channels were not contaminated by the molasses leak.

A large number of bigger fish that were closer to the point of contamination died but those downstream were able to escape the incoming dirty water.

“There was a large scale fish mortality. The livestock was not affected because people didn’t bring them to the river water like they usually do,” Kuldip Kumar, the chief wildlife warden of Punjab, said.

Kumar said that the dirty water flowed downstream and entered the irrigation channels that feed Rajasthan and Punjab.

The loss of fish was staggering with the most mortality believed to be of three kinds of catfish: the Malhi (Wallago attu), Singhara (Sperata seenghala), monster fish (Rita rita) and the Rohu (Labeo rohita) and Mrigal carp (Cirrhinus cirrhosus), as per preliminary reports.

Villagers buried some of the fish they tried to retrieve from the waters but most were left to rot along the banks and became food for dogs, riverine birds and other fish. District authorities issued advisories to fishermen to not sell the fish that died from the pollution but some were sold anyway in places further away like Amritsar.

“The fishermen who caught the dead fish did not keep them for their own consumption, they sold all of them to the market,” a forest department official said on the condition of anonymity.

“Why would they eat this fish when they saw how they died?” he asked.

The dolphins may have survived the initial death blow but factors like a diminished prey base, which includes catfish, could affect them and the long-term impact on the ecosystem will have to be studied.

“We are still investigating the impact on the river and species,” GS Majithia, chief engineer at the Punjab Pollution Control Board, who is leading a probe into the incident, said.

The Rs 25 lakh security posted by the sugar mill was seized and it was shut down on May 18.

The actions came too late, according to Kanwar. The pollution control board waited for a disaster to take action ignoring red flags along the way, and opportunities to take action, she said.

“They were fined, they were shut down, but the fish are dead,” Atman Singh, a local forest official who guards the Harike bird sanctuary, said.

The elderly men in his group, who also guard the bird sanctuary, nodded sagely. They seemed to have grasped something that slipped from the consideration of officials: No amount of fines and shut factories could manufacture a lost species.

“The fish are gone,” one said quietly shaking his head.","In polluted Punjab river, the miracle and mystery of dolphins surviving mass death",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvaW4tcG9sbHV0ZWQtcHVuamFiLXJpdmVyLXRoZS1taXJhY2xlLWFuZC1teXN0ZXJ5LW9mLWRvbHBoaW5zLXN1cnZpdmluZy1tYXNzLWRlYXRoL3N0b3J5LU9rSEFFNVZ1VUZsaEVydUxXa1pLSkouaHRtbNIBoAFodHRwczovL20uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2luLXBvbGx1dGVkLXB1bmphYi1yaXZlci10aGUtbWlyYWNsZS1hbmQtbXlzdGVyeS1vZi1kb2xwaGlucy1zdXJ2aXZpbmctbWFzcy1kZWF0aC9zdG9yeS1Pa0hBRTVWdVVGbGhFcnVMV2taS0pKX2FtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/05/22/Pictures/_a183224e-5db4-11e8-b354-8e7f0da49342.JPG,2018-05-22,"{'sent': 'IST\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['IST']}}",Indus River Dolphin

At least 10 species, including the Ganges river dolphin and the gharial, found in Ganga for centuries, are on the verge of extinction, according to new report released by the ministry of water resources last week.

While the dolphin is listed as an endangered species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN ) Red list, the Gharial is critically endangered in the same list. The other species include birds such as the black bellied tern and Indian skimmer; turtles such as the northern river terrapin, three stripped roofed turtle, red crowned roofed turtle; and the golden mahaseer fish.

The sarus crane, the mugger crocodile and the snow trout have been put in the vulnerable list.

The report ‘Macro Fauna of the Ganga River — Status of Conservation of Select Aquatic Species’ was prepared by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) Dehradun as part of the ‘Biodiversity Conservation and Ganga Rejuvenation’ project by National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG). The project, according to officials, aims to develop a science based restoration plan for the Ganga.

The report says the Dolphin population, which was about 10,000 in late 19th century, reduced to 3,526 in 2014, adding that while the population of dolphins had stabilised between 2012 to 2015, it showed a drastic decline in recent years.

The report said the dolphins are now restricted to the Ganga and its larger tributaries, but have disappeared completely from the Haridwar-Bijnor barrage, which is about 100 kms downstream of Haridwar.

The report said that gharials (fish-eating crocodiles) were on the verge of extinction in India by the mid 1970s, until a captive breeding programme was initiated during 1975 , taking the population to 1,200 by 1995. The report said the gharial population again showed a decline since 1999. “The presence of gharial is important for health of the river. It eats sick fish and disappearance of gharial from the ecosystem signifies collapses ecosystem due to polluted water or drop in water levels,’’ the report said.

“Its a rapid assessment done so far, the NCGM is supporting the baseline studies done by WII. The project, once completed, will help in Conservation of the species...’’ said Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Director General, NMCG.

According to officials, the river is showing some positive signs.

Environment expert Himanshu Thakkar said, “The species are affected when their habitat gets affected. It’s not just the pollution, it’s sand mining, dredging, building dams. For example, there is dredging taking place in the dolphin sanctuary but dolphins who are blind animals, send sound waves to know about their prey, their habitat, the dredging will affect the signals they receive from their habitat. We need to understand, how to protect , recreate and rejuvenate the habitat of these species.”",At least 10 species in the Ganga face extinction: Ministry reports,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiENVEz912VgjSOmj-78H1pzEqFggEKg4IACoGCAoww7k_MMevCDCm4QE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/05/27/Pictures/rajmahal-february-hindustan-jharkhand-rajmahal-dolphin-february_9d79262c-61c8-11e8-b354-8e7f0da49342.jpg,2018-05-27,"{'sent': 'At least 10 species, including the Ganges river dolphin and the gharial, found in Ganga for centuries, are on the verge of extinction, according to new report released by the ministry of water resources last week.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['At least 10'], 'GPE': ['Ganges', 'Ganga'], 'ORG': ['the ministry of water resources']}}",Gharial
0,"Millions of species inhabit the oceans, lakes, and rivers that are a fundamental part of our planet. As more and more awareness is being raised about how humans affect the ocean, it’s also important to understand the true impact we’re having on marine animals. We recently brought you the story of the vaquita, a small porpoise that is facing certain extinction. Unfortunately, the vaquita isn’t alone in its plight, with numerous marine animals on the IUCN endangered species list.

By being more informed, we can take steps to reverse some of the damage done before these species reach the vaquita’s critical point. And with heightened awareness about everything from ocean plastic to the impact chemicals in our sunscreen have on the ecosystem, we can begin to take steps to conserve these important animals.

Because every day should be World Ocean Day, we take a moment to reflect on just a few of the endangered marine animals around the world. The more you know, the more you can help.

Here are just 7 of the endangered marine species that need our help before their populations disappear.

Yangtze Finless Porpoise

Asia’s longest river used to be home to two freshwater dolphins, but with the extinction of the Baiji dolphin in 2006, only the Yangtze finless porpoise calls the river home. The Chinese government has been working with organizations like the Wolrd Wildlife Foundation and IUNC to help save the porpoise from extinction, as it is also on the endangered list. In fact, in 2014 the Chinese government granted the Yangtze finless porpoise the highest protection allowed under the law.

As the only known porpoise to live exclusively in fresh water, the Yangtze finless porpoise’s habitat is limited to the western Yangtze River. Increased pollution and overdevelopment has stunted the porpoise’s food supply, while illegal fishing gear has entangled many of these creatures and led to drowning. There are some porpoises in captivity and three breeding grounds in Japan, which have produced five births. Though only two of the five survived for a few years, there is hope that breeding in captivity can be successful.

Where do they live? Yangtze River

How many are left? From 1,000 to 1,800

What can you do to help? Support the WWF, which has been reconnecting floodplain lakes along the river in order to allow migration and secure food supplies.

Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle

The smallest marine turtle in the world, the Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle, has seen a sharp decline since an amateur video from 1947 showed 42,000 females nesting in a single day. The critically endangered Kemp’s Ridley lives in shallow waters where they can feed on crab, mollusks, and jellyfish. Part of its misfortune came from egg overharvesting over the course of the last century. Though their nesting beaches in Rancho Nuevo have been protected since 1966 and changes to fishing gear have been implemented to leave them unharmed, the Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle hasn’t seen a population rebound.

Where do they live? Mainly the Gulf of Mexico, though some can be found along the Atlantic coast

How many are left? Between 7,000 to 9,000 nesting females

What can you do to help? Don’t purchase items made from sea turtle parts, which are often sold to tourists around the world. Also, you can donate to the Sea Turtle Conservancy.

Hawaiian Monk Seal

Though we mainly think of seals living in cold temperatures, the Hawaiian monk seal makes its home on the mostly uninhabited northwestern islands of Hawaii. One of the most endangered marine mammals in the world, these cute creatures have been threatened by the development of the coastline. As humans move in, seals are pushed out of their natural habitat or disturbed by beachgoers. More humans also mean more trash, and the Hawaiian monk seal has the highest entanglement rate of any marine mammal.

Where do they live? Northwestern Hawaiian Islands

How many are left? Fewer than 1,200

What can you do to help? The Pacific Islands branch of NOAA has wonderful guidelines on how to be a “good neighbor” to Hawaiian monk seals.

North Atlantic Right Whale

Despite whaling protection since the 1930’s, commercial whale hunting has devastated the population of this gentle giant. The North Atlantic right whale is easily recognizable due to the white calluses on its head, which stand out against its dark skin. The species was especially popular with commercial whale hunters as early as the 11th century. Forty percent of its body weight is blubber, which causes it to float when dead. This is unusual for whales, but made it quite easy for hunters to collect the blubber. By 1935, there were estimates that the population was down to 100, and though commercial whaling was banned in 1937, the species continues to struggle. Today, the biggest threats to the North Atlantic right whale’s survival are collisions with boats and entanglement in fixed fishing equipment.

Where do they live? Western North Atlantic Ocean

How many are left? 300 – 350

What can you do to help? Support the WDC, an organization that focuses on the conservation of whales and dolphins.

Galápagos Penguin

Where do they live? Galápagos archipelago

How many are left? Less than 2,000

What can you do to help? The Galápagos Conservancy works to rebuild nesting sites in order to reverse the declining population of the species.

Giant Devil Ray

The large, elegant giant devil ray grows to almost 17 feet, making it one of the largest rays. Living in deep water, it feeds on plankton and small fish. With its large pectoral fins, the giant devil ray is easily able to traverse ocean waters. Exact population estimates are difficult, but it has been listed as endangered by the IUCN since 2006. Why? The giant devil ray has an extremely low birth rate. They are ovoviviparous, which means that only one egg at a time can develop inside a female and it takes about 24 months to hatch! And unfortunately, the ray often gets caught in fishing equipment like tuna traps, trawls, and dragnets meant for other fish. Its high bycatch mortality rate, coupled with a low birth rate for the species places it in danger.

Where do they live? Mediterranean and Eastern Atlantic

How many are left? About 1,600

What can you do to help? Support the IUCN, whose Shark Specialist Group has outlined goals and actions to help protect this species, which gets less attention than many other threatened marine animals.

Ganges River Dolphin

Where do they live? Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems

How many are left? 1,200 to 1,800

What can you do to help? Donate to WWF India which is working the State Forest Department on a strategy for dolphin conservation and conducts education and awareness programs for local fishermen.

CHITWAN: The Crocodile Breeding Centre based at Kasara in Chitwan National Park has welcomed 211 Ghariyals, crocodilian native to Indian Sub-continent, after the eggs in the centre and eggs collected earlier from Rapti and Narayani river banks hatched, recently.

118 Ghariyals hatched from 235 eggs collected from seven nests in Rapti river bank. Likewise, 46 Ghariyals emerged out of 82 eggs brought to the centre from Narayani river bank. Meanwhile, 47 crocodilians hatched from eggs produced by the long-nosed crocodile at the centre, informed CNP Assistant Conservation Officer, Bedan Bahadur Khadka.

According to the centre, out of the total aquatic crocodilians hatched at the centre, only 50 per cent live to witness adulthood. At present, there are 520 crocodiles in the breeding centre.

As part of conservation of the endangered species, the breeding centre which was established in 1978, collects eggs from nests in Rapti-Narayani river system and facilitates hatching if the nests face threats from the rivers. After the eggs hatch, CNP releases the aquatic crocodilian back in the river.

This year, CNP has released 119 crocodiles in Rapti river, while a total of 1,365 crocodiles have been set free in major rivers such as Rapti, Koshi, Narayani among others, thus far.

On the contrary, the number of crocodiles has rapidly gone down over the years as the aquatic predators face threats from pollution and unsustainable mining practices. Moreover, crocodiles bred and released by the centre, swim to India in search of prey, never to return back.

0,"KARACHI: A team comprising of 20 surveyors from World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Pakistan, provincial wildlife departments, Zoological Survey of Pakistan (ZSP) and other partner organisations recently conducted a survey to determine the occurrence of the endangered Indus River dolphin, far north of its range from Jinnah to Chashma Barrage in the Indus River.

This is the second year in a row that WWF-Pakistan has conducted assessments to investigate the status of this species in different locations within its historical population range. The ultimate objective of these assessments is to help make informed decisions for conservation planning.

The Indus River dolphin is an endangered freshwater cetacean that is endemic to the Indus River system. The species are found in five sub-populations separated by barrages on the Indus River.

“The survey was conducted along a 70 km long section of the Indus River, located close to the foothills of the Himalayas. This area has not been surveyed since 2006,” explained WWF Wildlife Director Dr. Babar Khan. “The survey methodology was consistent with the previous assessments used since 2001, which helps to obtain reliable and comparable data,” he added.

Dr. Babar Khan said that previous surveys had estimated less than five dolphins within this river section and this was the smallest known sub-population of the species. “There was concern that, owing to its small size, the population may be wiped out in the near future,” stated WWF wildlife director.

The survey revealed that no dolphins were recorded and this, combined with information from local communities, suggests that dolphins may have been locally wiped out between Jinnah and Chashma barrages. These results support the previous hypothesis that the Indus River dolphin is declining in the upper reaches of the Indus River.

Experts attribute this decline in the population of Indus’s blind dolphins to two main factors; reduced flow of the river during dry season and habitat fragmentation by irrigation barrages. Reduced flow has a direct impact on the dolphins as this limits the physical habitat available for them, changes the depth of river, flow velocity and temperature of the water.

According to Dr. Gill Braullik, a member of International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Cetacean Specialists Group, the dolphin population is confined to just 20 percent of their natural habitat range due to the construction of numerous dams and barrages along the Indus River. He said that another factor contributing to the decline of dolphin populations is rapid industrialization. He explained that rapid industrialization has significantly contributed to increased surface water pollution in the country, as over 90% of industrial and domestic effluents make their way to the river untreated. “The dumping of untreated industrial waste in the river is affecting aquatic life adversely,” he explained.

According to Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department (PWPD) Director General Khalid Ayaz Khan, the survey was a part of the continuous research efforts critical to facilitate conservation policymaking for endangered species, like the Indus River dolphin, based on scientific evidences. Appreciating the collaborative efforts of WWF-Pakistan, Punjab Wildlife Department and other stakeholders, Khalid Ayaz Khan said that the study followed standard protocols for the collection of reliable and comparable data on the state of the dolphin population and its habitat.

Khalid Ayaz Khan said that the PWPD has initiated a development project along the Indus River with the aims of establishing three dolphin rescue and monitoring stations on Indus River, conducting a satellite telemetry study and translocating stranded dolphins to the stretch of Indus River between Jinnah and Chashma Barrages. “This will help in the conservation of endangered fauna of the area, particularly the Indus River dolphin,” added director general PWPD.

A comprehensive dolphin population assessment was carried out by WWF-Pakistan in March to April 2017, covering the 800 km stretch that includes the three largest dolphin sub-populations between Chashma and Sukkur Barrages.

The survey recorded a marked increase in the population of the species. There has been much focus on the largest sub-populations of Indus dolphins that are present downstream in Sindh and lower Punjab, and these populations appear to be increasing in abundance. However, the present distribution of the Indus River dolphin is about 80 percent less than what was determined in the 1870s.

0,"KARACHI: A recent survey suggests that the Indus river dolphin might have been locally wiped out between Jinnah and Chashma barrages as the team couldn’t spot a single specimen. Both barrages are located in the Mianwali district of Punjab.

The survey team included experts from the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan, Zoological Survey of Pakistan (ZSP) and provincial wildlife departments.

This is the second year in a row that WWF-Pakistan has conducted assessments to investigate the status of this species in different locations within its historical population range.

The ultimate objective of these assessments is to help make informed decisions for conservation planning.

This time the survey was carried out far north of the dolphin’s range from Jinnah to Chashma Barrage in the Indus.

The survey covered more than 70km area, which is close to the foothills of the Himalayas and has not been surveyed since 2006.

“Local communities interviewed during the survey supported the finding, also indicated by previous hypothesis that the Indus river dolphin is declining in the upper reaches of the Indus River,” said Dr Babar Khan, director wildlife at the WWF-P.

According to him, previous surveys estimated less than five dolphins within this river section, which was the smallest known sub-population of the species.

“There was concern that because of the small size of the population it may be wiped out in the near future,” he explained, adding that the survey methodology was consistent with the previous assessments used since 2001 which helped to obtain reliable and comparable data.

Among the potential factors which might have contributed to the range decline, he pointed out, included low discharge of the river during the dry season and habitat fragmentation by irrigation barrages.

“Reduced flow has a direct impact on the dolphins as this limits the physical habitat available for them, changes the depth of river, flow velocity and temperature of the water,” he said.

It is important to mention that the Indus river dolphin is an endangered freshwater cetacean and endemic to the Indus River system. The species are found in five sub-populations separated by barrages on the Indus.

According to Dr Gill Braullik, cetaceans expert and member of IUCN Cetacean Specialists Group, the dolphin population is now confined to just 20 per cent of their natural habitat range due to the construction of numerous dams and barrages along the Indus.

Dolphins are also threatened by stranding in irrigation canals and accidentally becoming caught in fishing nets.

Additionally, rapid industrialisation has significantly contributed to increased surface water pollution in the country, as over 90pc of industrial and domestic effluent make their way to the river untreated.

The situation is severe in the Indus tributaries which pass through major industrial areas as they carry even higher loads of pollutants than the main river itself.

Lack of periodic and proper mechanisms of water quality assessment of the river further intensifies the problem to identify those sections of the river which carry higher loads of waste.

Khalid Ayaz Khan, the director general of the Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department, said that a development project along the Indus had been initiated to establish three dolphin rescue and monitoring stations, a satellite telemetry study and translocation of stranded dolphins to the stretch of Indus River between Jinnah and Chashma barrages.

“This will help in the conservation of endangered fauna of the area, particularly the Indus river dolphin,” he said.

0,"KARACHI: After almost a decade, the zoo has seen the birth of 25 Russell’s vipers in a single litter, raising the number of this species to 31 at the facility.

The last births in Russell’s vipers happened in 2008. The zoo lost the young ones within a few days of their birth whereas their parents survived for some years.

“The babies are currently being kept with their parents but we will separate them from one another as this species is known to be cannibalistic,” said Dr Mansoor Qazi, the zoo director, adding that the young ones were being fed with worms and bugs.

Births in deer, black bucks, nilgai, rhesus monkeys, blue peacocks, crocodiles and tortoises also reported

Unlike most snakes, which lay eggs, Russell’s vipers give birth to live young ones. “This snake is viviparous (giving birth to living young that develop within the mother’s body rather than hatching from eggs) and produces up to 50 young ones in a litter. The gestation period is three to six months,” added Dr Qazi.

The Russell’s viper, he said, was one of the four large snakes found in the subcontinent and known to be highly venomous after krait, another large snake.

“The species has no problem living in highly populated areas. It’s responsible for causing the most snakebite incidents and deaths among all venomous snakes. Its venom is used in different medicines,” he said.

Apart from vipers, the zoo has also reported a single birth in fallow deer, four in white fallow deer, three in black bucks, two in nilgai, one in rhesus monkeys, one in spotted deer, three in blue peacocks, 10 in crocodiles and three in tortoises.

“We have got births in spur-thighed tortoises, an endangered African species living here since 1990s whereas the crocodiles were brought in 1980s. At that time, however, the crocodiles were not paired and the zoo later got females with the help of the Sindh wildlife department,” Dr Qazi said, sharing how these old zoo reptiles were brought in.

He also expressed his desire to bring a pair of gavials, also known as gharial, a type of Asian crocodile distinguished by their long, thin snout.

The zoo, he recalled, was left with one male gavial in 2003-04, which was given away to the Lahore zoo, having two females of the same species, under an animal exchange programme.

“Unfortunately, however, they all died one by one. It would be a great animal recovery effort if we could bring this species to Pakistan and raise it here,” he said.

According to information available on World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan, the gharial is considered to be one of the most critically threatened of all crocodilians, becoming alarmingly close to extinction in the 1970s.

“Gharial are extremely rare in both India and Nepal, virtually extirpated in Pakistan, Bhutan and Bangladesh, and probably extinct in Myanmar.

“Reports of gharial remaining in the Sindh region of Pakistan are persistent. But, there appears to be a very small number, possibly only one or two individuals. The species is virtually extinct in Pakistan,” the website says.

0,"Rainforest Trust is pleased to announce the purchase of five parcels of vital riparian habitat in partnership with KTK-BELT and International Conservation Fund of Canada (ICFC). The acquired properties lie next to Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve in Nepal, and their purchase will fortify and expand the country’s first and largest Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance site.

Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, with a new expanded total acreage of 42,560, provides habitat protection for numerous globally threatened species, including six species of vultures – four of which are Critically Endangered – as well as the Critically Endangered Red-crowned Roofed Turtle and Bengal Florican. With 485 recorded bird species in this small reserve, it is considered one of the most important aquatic bird reserves in South Asia.

“Rainforest Trust is proud to partner with KTK-BELT and ICFC to strategically acquire 40 acres of threatened woodland and wetland habitat and expand the spectacular Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve,”

said Rainforest Trust CEO Dr. Paul Salaman. “This additional habitat protection helps numerous endangered wildlife species, like the Ganges River Dolphin and the Red-crowned Roofed Turtle.”

The expanded reserve section includes an important forest that is vital for the Critically Endangered nesting vultures. In the last 20 years, forest cover has declined by more than 80 percent in the Koshi Tappu ecosystem, reducing these nesting sites in particular. This expanded security also prevents land-grabbing in this sensitive buffer region, and provides increased defense against invasive weeds, wildlife trapping and overfishing.

The completion of this project will assist ongoing efforts by other institutions and nongovernmental organizations currently working to double the size of Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve due to its ecological importance.

Another crucial aspect of this purchase is that the parcel is located in the south of the reserve, where conservation efforts have been challenged due to a lack of community engagement, stemming from discrimination the community has historically faced. Our local partner worked closely with the communities surrounding this new protected area to increase education about the importance of conservation, and they provided valuable alternative livelihood opportunities such as vulture eco-tourism, Ganges River Dolphin viewing areas and bio-brick production using harvested invasive plant species as a benefit to the local populations.

“Are we happy to suppose that our grandchildren may never be able to see an elephant, except in a picture book?” – David Attenborough.

Of the 5 big games, it is not so easy to come by an Elephant in Nigeria today – both in the wild and in captive areas; except you find yourself in the Yankari National Park, believed to have the largest and most important Elephant herd of merely 100-150 or the Omu – Shasha Forest, Ogun State. The other place you can readily come by an Elephant is at the Jos Wildlife Park where an 8-foot, one-tusked, African Savannah Elephant (Loxodonta africana) has been stranded in an isolated block for 38-years.

A report by the United Nations in 2015, asserts that up to 100 Elephants – both Savannah and Forest species are being slaughtered daily in Africa by poachers, primarily for their tusk which the Chinese market constantly demands. As organizations and conservationists intensify efforts to halt illegal ivory trade and wildlife trafficking, recent research posits that the whole of Africa has an estimate of 352,271 Savanna Elephants left, a far cry from between 3-5 million censored by World Wildlife Foundation in the 20th century.

25 years after a ban was placed on ivory trade, emerging markets still makes it more difficult to address this menace. In 2015, the Chinese government in a bid to reduce the demand for African tusks and protect wild elephants made conscious efforts to curb ivory imports; however, reoccurring reports and pictures stress that a lot more Elephants are being poached in southern and northern Nigeria and their tusks exported to Asian countries. The most recent that made the news in Bauchi, Ogun, Osun and Idanre area of Ondo state, Nigeria.

Across the globe, as World Elephant Day is celebrated today, one wonders what will become of the few Elephants left in Nigeria; hence, the call for pragmatic, pro-wildlife actions to turn the tide and save the remaining Elephants in Nigeria. The efforts of Nigeria-based organizations like Wildlife of Africa Conservation Initiative through her various Wildlife Education programs and the Nigerian Conservation Foundation through her Forest Elephant Alive Campaign, among others, should not only be commended, they should be better funded to help them explore effective, science-based conservation strategies.

If we want future generations to live in a world where elephants thrive, the Wildlife Conservation Society has outlined and advocated the need to:

1. Increase aerial surveillance in strongholds.

2. Train and deploy more rangers in the protected areas.

3. Supply new rangers with equipment.

4. Assist the authorities in tracking and shutting down trafficking networks.

5. Grow our community development programs to support local communities to co-exist with wildlife.

What will you do to help protect elephants and to support existing Elephant conservation initiatives?

0,"Before matriculating at the University of the Arts London, Tim Flach took a foundation course to study techniques of design. His childhood had involved a lot of drawing and painting, and he spent many days sketching landscapes and natural settings. He’d never seriously tried photography as a medium until one of his course instructors told the students to go to the London Zoo to work on compositional exercises, only this time, not with a pencil or pen—with a camera.

“So the first roll of film I took connected me to the subject of animals,” Flach said in a recent interview. The experience immediately resonated with him. “I was attracted to visual things instead of verbal,” he says. “I was always interested in the relationship between ourselves and sentient beings.”

Flach’s remarkable, award-winning photography is an exercise in exploring such relationships. Since publishing Equus (2008), a collection dedicated to horses, he has produced a series of extraordinary photographs including Dog Gods (2010) and More Than Human (2012), all of which combine the art of portraiture with wildlife photography in ways that draw out the sameness between us and wildlife, as opposed to a sense of otherness.

Flach’s most recent collection, Endangered (2017), takes his animal portraiture to a whole new level. Portraits of animals both iconic and exotic draw undeniable parallels between us and them, whether it be a Yunnan snub-nosed monkey striking a contemplative pose or a mother chimp rocking her baby.

Flach is driven to draw us closer to the natural world. “Humanity's well-being, and ultimately our survival, is wrapped up in how we manage our relationship with nature,” he said. “That’s why the book was called Endangered. It wasn't just an inference to the animals and their status on the [endangered species] red list. It is also a statement about the fact that if we don't find value in the natural world, and we don’t change our current relationship to the natural world, then we don't have a future either.”

Flach photographed the world’s last male northern white rhinocerous before it died on March 1, a photograph of which appears in Endangered. A brutal civil war in Sudan contributed to wiping out the species, and Flach went to Sudan to document the rhino knowing it may very well be the last time it could be photographed.

“Going there to witness that, there was this sense of, how did it come to this that I have to be here to photograph the last male white rhino?” he said. “The fact that I was there photographing it was just a representation of the fact that we had come to this awful point.”

Flach points out that the story is just one of many others that don’t get the same amount of press attention, which is why he strives to photograph as many broad and diverse species as possible in his work. “There are many species that disappear into oblivion without us being mindful of it because they are not sexy, or it’s a small bug or something,” he said. “Ecologically they could be really important, but they are probably not cute or fearsome, or they don’t have an iconic-ness about them.”

Flach has a remarkable facility of capturing precise movements with the camera in such a way that the tiniest detail, such as the filigree of a hair on a panda’s head or the stippled green skin on a lemur leaf frog’s face, jumps off the page. In one photograph, a Bengal tiger shakes off water after getting wet, the gyrating rivulets of water like splash-paint spraying off its head.

It’s all part of his overall effort to bring us and these animals closer together.

“When you have a tiger shaking, it brings you back to maybe a golden retriever shaking off water after it’s gone into a pond or something,” he said. “The idea is that it’s a familiar action, but you don’t necessarily connect it with a big cat. A lot of my images are about those kinds of threads linking us back emotionally to things that feel familiar but are different.”

While the animals are often heart-warming in Flach’s photos, the stories behind them are dark. Many of the photographs are of animals that have suffered from climate disruption and human exploitation, such as in the case of the ploughshare tortoise. Only some 100 are left in the wild. In order to prevent poachers from seeking them out to sell them as exotic pets, a nursery protecting the species has been forced to engrave their shells with numbers so they will be less desirable.

In other photographs, entire scenes can be found hidden amid the finer aspects of the image, as with Flach’s photograph of Djala, a western lowland gorilla, photographed at an English sanctuary run by the Aspinall Foundation. In an extraordinarily intimate photo of Djala lifting water to his mouth, the horizon line is reflected in the water on his fingers, with trees and animals shimmering on its surface like a reflecting pool.

Flach mainly uses a Hasselblad camera to get his shots, but for Endangered, he needed longer lenses and often used a Canon 5DS 50 megapixel, which helped him speed up the ISO in ways he couldn’t do five years earlier.

Flach says that, above all, he is exploring the ways in which certain types of images resonate the most powerfully, which is why he employs the art of human portraiture in his wildlife photography. “A lot of my work concentrates on the portraiture, because our tendency is to shape portraits of animals as human faces, so we tend to then find a sense of emotional connection. You need emotion, you need empathy, if you want to create desired change. We can know something, but it’s not until it touches our hearts do we actually want to take action.”",Our Future Depends on a New Relationship to the Natural World,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpZXJyYWNsdWIub3JnL3NpZXJyYS9zbGlkZXNob3cvb3VyLWZ1dHVyZS1kZXBlbmRzLW5ldy1yZWxhdGlvbnNoaXAtbmF0dXJhbC13b3JsZD9zbGlkZT3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/www.sierraclub.org/files/slideshows/SIERRA-1-%20TIM-%20Bengal%20Tiger%20Shaking-TN.jpg,2018-08-22,"{'sent': 'Before matriculating at the University of the Arts London, Tim Flach took a foundation course to study techniques of design.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the University of the Arts London'], 'PERSON': ['Tim Flach']}}",Tiger

A fascinating new photo book reveals the ultimate places for spotting your favourite animals.

The A To Z of Watching Wildlife, published by Lonely Planet, was written by acclaimed British biologists Amy-Jane Beer and Mark Carwardine and in total, 300 'exciting and unusual creatures' are featured.

The experts provide details around each critter and reveal some of the lesser-known places on the map where travellers can find them. Scroll down for a sneak peek of the new tome - a round-the-world safari from the comfort of your chair...

Humpback whale

For a very memorable whale encounter, travellers are urged to head out on a kayak in spots including Hawaii

If you dream of seeing humpback whales in the wild, blowing and exhibiting their incredible acrobatic ability, the Lonely Planet experts recommend heading to Hervey Bay in Australia where known individuals visit each year on migration.

Apparently tour boats are decked out with underwater microphones, so the haunting whale song can be heard.

Also, memorable kayak encounters can be had in spots including Hawaii, Alaska or the Saguenay-St Lawrence Marine Park in Québec.

Tarsier

The tarsier is the world's second-smallest primate, fitting snugly into the palm of an adult's hand. It has the largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal

The tarsier is the world's second-smallest primate, fitting snugly into the palm of an adult's hand. It has the largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal.

They're also known for being the only carnivorous primate, feasting on insects - and occasionally birds and small mammals.

The Lonely Planet experts note that while they live across a swathe of Southeast Asian islands, including the Philippines and Malaysia, the pygmy tarsier was rediscovered on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi in 2008, having thought to be extinct. The Tangkoko-Batuangas Dua Saudara Nature Reserve is noted as being one of its accessible homes in this area.

Keel-billed toucan

The keel-billed toucan boasts a colourful bill, which it can use with 'surprising dexterity and delicacy' to gather fruit and insects to eat

The keel-billed toucan boasts a colourful bill, which it can use with 'surprising dexterity and delicacy' to gather fruit and insects to eat.

The experts say that the 'clownish' and 'playful' birds fly as little as possible and prefer to hang out together, feeding and roosting.

While keelbills live in southern Mexico, northern Colombia and Venezuela, it is also the national bird of Belize. The naturalists note that the feathered critters can be seen on the mainland and are also present on Belize's barrier reef islands such as Ambergris Cay.

Narwhal

The mysterious narwhal, with giant protruding tusks, are notoriously tricky to spot

The mysterious narwhal - known as the 'unicorn of the sea' thanks to the male's protruding head tusks - is a notoriously tricky creature to spot.

For those who wish to see the shy sea mammal, the Lonely Planet book directs readers to head to the edges of the Arctic ice, and up to the Nunavut communities of Pond Inlet, Resolute and Arctic Bay.

The experts say that one of the signs of a narwhal pod being in the area is 'the sight of a spiralling ""horn"" piercing the water like King Arthur's sword, Excalibur'.

Koala

The koala is considered one of Australia's cutest native marsupials with big teddy bear-like ears and shiny black eyes

The koala is considered one of Australia's cutest native marsupials with big teddy bear-like ear, shiny black eyes and a sleepily-slow pace of life.

Its large head apparently contains shock-absorbing fluid in case of a tumble while relaxing in a tree. The Lonely Planet experts add that it also has one of the smallest brains of any mammal relative to body size.

While koalas are present in the groves of eucalyptus in Townsville, Queensland, southern Victoria and South Australia, the biologists recommend less-known spots to see them including You Yangs Regional Park near Geelong, Victoria and Kangaroo Island in South Australia.

Brown bear

Travellers are advised to wear bright clothing and tie bells to their backpacks to help keep bears at bay. Pepper spray is another recommended measure

The Lonely Planet experts highlight that the brown bear has the largest range of any bear species.

While Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska is a popular place for sightings, the Wild Brown Bear Centre near Vartius on the Finland-Russian border is revealed as a top spot, with continual light and safe hides to hang out in.

Travellers are advised to wear bright clothing and tie bells to their backpacks to help keep bears at bay. Pepper spray is another recommended measure.

Monarch butterfly

The monarch is one of the world's best-known butterflies with its distinct orange, black, and white coloured wings

The monarch is one of the world's best-known butterflies with its distinct orange, black, and white coloured wings.

The insect is also famed for its mammoth migration, which takes it on a journey covering up to 3,000 miles.

For a less commercial encounter with the colourful creature, the Lonely Planet experts recommend heading to the Piedra Herrada sanctuary, south of Mexico City. The winter colonies around the cities of Pismo Beach and Goleta in California are also said to be astounding, while in the summer, Point Pelee on the northern shore of Lake Erie, Ontario, is tipped as a top spot.

Japanese macaque

Japanese macaque living in Joshinetsu National Park are famed for bathing in hot springs during winter and they are also found on the main islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu

The Japanese macaque, also known as the snow monkey, is able to survive harsh winter temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.

Those living in Joshinetsu National Park are famed for bathing in hot springs during winter and they are also found on the main islands of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu.

But the Lonely Planet experts say a troop living on Koshima Island off Kyushu display an equally interesting habit, with them dipping pieces of food in seawater to season it, mimicking human behaviour.

Kea

The red underside of a kea's wing can be seen as it lands on a patch of rock in New Zealand's Mount Cook National Park

The kea is the world's only alpine parrot with its home around the higher altitudes on New Zealand's South Island. Along with having a striking red colour under its wings, it is known for being extremely clever, with the ability to complete a range of tasks.

Over recent decades, the ground-nesting bird - which feeds on berries, seeds, leaves and grubs - has come under threat with the introduction of imported predators such as cats and rats.

The Lonely Planet experts reveal that Arthur's Pass National Park, located deep in the New Zealand Alps, offers regular sightings, especially along Scotts Track to Avalanche Peak.

Lesser flamingo

To see large concentrations of lesser flamingo, travellers are advised to head to alkaline lakes such as Natron in Tanzania, the salt pans of Etosha National Park in Namibia, Makgadikgadi in Botswana and at Kamfers Dam in South Africa

The lesser flamingo is the smallest yet most abundant species of flamingo, the Lonely Planet experts note, with populations 'widespread across southern Africa, the African great lakes and Rift Valley, as well as extreme West Africa, Yemen and India, principally the western state of Gujarat'.

To see large concentrations of the long-legged pink birds, travellers are advised to head to breeding grounds around alkaline lakes such as Natron in Tanzania, the salt pans of Etosha National Park in Namibia, Makgadikgadi in Botswana and at Kamfers Dam in South Africa.

The flamingo gets its striking pink plumage from its diet, which consists of microscopic shrimps and algae.

Cheetah

While Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve and Serengeti National Park in Tanzania are popular places to see cheetah, other places offering sightings include Etosha National Park in Namibia and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park on the South Africa-Botswana border

The cheetah is the world's fastest sprinter - it can reach 60mph in just three seconds.

While Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve and Serengeti National Park in Tanzania are popular places to see the spotted beauties, other places offering sightings include Etosha National Park in Namibia and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park on the South Africa-Botswana border.

The Lonely Planet experts point out that critically endangered Asiatic cheetahs are restricted to central and northern Iran.

Glowworm

Despite being called glowworms, these bioluminescent creepy crawlies are in fact beetles, not worms

Despite being called glowworms, these bioluminescent creepy crawlies are in fact beetles, not worms. The adult beetles glow to attract a mate, while the larvae lights up to entice prey.

In New Zealand, there are dozens of spots to see them, with the showcaves of Waitomo in North Island being the best-known and most popular location.

However, the Lonely Planet experts say that glowworms can be seen in 'other caves and sheltered areas of woodland' all over that area, where there's a bit more peace and quiet to watch the magical scene.

Lion

A pride of lions sit among the golden grasses carpeting Hwange National Park in west Zimbabwe. The area is also home to large elephant herds and African wild dogs

Many wildlife fans flock to Kenya's Masai Mara and the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater National Parks in Tanzania in a bid to see lions.

But the Lonely Planet experts say that spectacular sightings can also be had at the slightly lesser known parks of South Luangwa and Kafue in Zambia or the Okavango Delta or Chobe National Park in Botswana.

For a 'lion encounter with a difference', travellers are advised to head to India's Gir Forest National Park as it is one of the last places where short-maned Asiatic lions can be seen.

Emperor penguin

To catch glimpse of the magnificent emperor penguin, travellers must journey to the frozen wilds of Antarctica

To catch glimpse of the magnificent emperor penguin, travellers must journey to the frozen wilds of Antarctica.

The Lonely Planet experts say that it's best to head south during the Antarctic summer from November to January, as 'the breeding grounds are in striking distance of open water (usually via helicopter) and there are chances to see parents and young on land and in their element at sea'.

When picking an expedition company to travel with, they add that it's best to select an itinerary that stops at spots including Gould Bay and Snow Hill Island.

Giraffe

There are different species of giraffe dotted across Africa, from Kenya to Somalia

There are different species of giraffe dotted across Africa, from Kenya to Somalia.

While some of the species are in decline, the Lonely Planet experts say that populations are actually increasing at Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, Etosha in Namibia and Kruger in South Africa.

And incredibly, at Kouré in Niger the critically endangered West African subspecies has increased tenfold in 20 years.

Tiger

For the best chance of seeing a Bengal tiger, the Lonely Planet experts direct travellers to central India and Rajasthan

For the best chance of seeing a Bengal tiger, the Lonely Planet experts direct travellers to Bandhavgarh National Park in Madhya Pradesh in central India and Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan.

Other areas are said to have 'larger or denser' populations but they are more difficult to access, with swampy terrain.

But the journey is said to be well worth it, with the sight of 'the world's largest cat reclining in a glade, bathing, patrolling a dirt road with lazy confidence or threading through trees' being a memory to 'last a lifetime'.

African savannah elephant

While elephant populations in east and south Africa have apparently become fragmented due to human intervention, Botswana's Chobe National Park is highlighted for having the largest remaining group

The Lonely Planet experts say if 'the lion is Africa's king of beasts', the elephant, 'the world's largest land animal, might be its high priestess'.

They add that 'an encounter in the wild leaves you in no doubt you've been touched by greatness - three to six tonnes of it'.

While elephant populations in east and south Africa have apparently become fragmented due to human intervention, Botswana's Chobe National Park is highlighted for having the largest remaining group.

Arabian oryx

Three Arabian oryx traverse the golden sands in the Desert Conservation Reserve near Dubai. The white antelope is famed for being the origin of unicorn myths, with them sometimes only showing a single horn when viewed from the side

The Lonely Planet experts reveal that the Arabian oryx is famed for being the origin of unicorn myths, with it sometimes only showing a single pointed horn when viewed from the side.

In the late 20th century, the svelte white antelope was apparently on the brink of extinction but thanks to conservation efforts, it became the first species to have its status downgraded from extinct in the wild to vulnerable.

The biologists say that for the best chance of seeing oryx in its natural environment, travellers should head to reserves including Wadi Rum or Shaumari in Jordan, Sir Bani Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, or the area around Ein Shahak in Israel.

Giant tortoise

The biologists highlight that giant tortoises were once widespread, but they suffered drastically from poaching and over-exploitation, with the gentle giants slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin and shells

The biologists highlight that giant tortoises were once widespread, but they suffered drastically from poaching and over-exploitation, with the gentle giants slaughtered for their eggs, meat, skin and shells.

They are now found on remote island areas, with the Galapagos being one of the best-known spots for getting up close to them.

However, the experts note that giant turtles (a different species) can also be seen on the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles, with smaller populations on other islands in the archipelago, as well as on Mauritius and nearby Rodrigues, and Changuu Island off Zanzibar.

Polar bear

Polar bear populations have been hit by climate change, with the depletion of sea ice leaving them stranded and exhausted from long swims to the next viable spot

Lonely Planet's A-Z Wildlife Watching is out now , priced at £19.99 for a hardback copy

Polar bear populations have been hit by climate change, with the depletion of sea ice leaving them stranded and exhausted from long swims to the next viable spot.

The biologists note that commercial sightseeing tours run around the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, and Churchill on Hudson Bay in Canada is another popular spot.

However, there is also the possibility of seeing the majestic bruins around the quieter northern areas of Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Scandinavia.

The World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF-India) along with the Uttar Pradesh forest department recently held a survey of Ganga River Dolphins and found that the dolphin population has increased from 22 in 2015 to 33 in 2018. The survey under the ‘My Ganga, My Dolphin’ programme was conducted from October 10-15 over a stretch of nearly 205km, spanning Bijnor barrage to Narora barrage along the river.

Officials said the 33 dolphins found during the survey included three calves and claimed that it indicated that the slow -breeding dolphins have flourished on the stretch and also indicates positive river health and biodiversity.

“The major dolphin population is found beyond Allahabad, Varanasi and Balia districts, besides a small population found between the two barrages in western UP. In the survey, we found 30 adults and three calves. This is an encouraging sign as dolphins are slow breeders but their population is increasing as they find sustainable environments and habitat,” Sanjeev Yadav, senior coordinator from WWF-India, said.

“These dolphins breed every two or three years. Finding three calves amongst a small population is encouraging. A normal dolphin here has a length of 1-1.5 metre. The two barrages are close and it is one of the pristine habitats and is rich in biodiversity,” he added.

The survey covered a 106.9km stretch from Bijnor to Garhmukteshwar, which is along the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, and another 98km stretch from Garhmukteshwar to Narora which is a Ramsar site.

The Convention of Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, is the intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for the conservation and proper use of wetlands and resources. India became a party to the convention in February 1982. India has 26 sites designated Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar Sites).

“The figures in the survey are encouraging as calves have been found, which means they are breeding. This is an indicator that the stretch is a suitable habitat for dolphins. Here, we also have a population of Ghariyals. We have ‘water schools’ run by WWF-India, to help sustain dolphins, and sensitise village residents. They now regard dolphins as a part of their ecosystem,” Lalit Verma, conservator of forests (Meerut), UP forest department, said.

Under the concept of ‘water schools,’ agencies have identified nearly 70 schools near the stretch and are sensitising students about the environment, biodiversity and the need to conserve the species.

The Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista Gangetica), or ‘Susu,’ is one of the two subspecies of the South Asian River Dolphin, the other being the Indus Dolphin ‘bhulan’ found in the Indus river in Pakistan, and Beas in India.

The four other freshwater dolphins in the world are the Amazon river dolphin ‘Boto’; Bolivian river dolphin; the Araguaian river Dolphin, and the Chinese Dolphin ,‘Baiji’, in China’s Yangtze river, which is reported to have been extinct since 2006.

The Ganges River Dolphin is also flagged as the ‘Tiger of the Ganges’, and is considered the mascot of a healthy aquatic environment and acts as an indicator species. According to officials, they are found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Recent population estimates in its entire distribution range recorded around 3,000 individuals. Out of this, more than 80% are within Indian territory.

The Bijnor to Narora Ramsar site is vital as it houses dolphins as well as ‘critically endangered’ Ghariyals. A programme for the reintroduction Ghariyals has been in place on the stretch since 2009.","Ganga river dolphins count rises to 33, up from 22 in 2015",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vbm9pZGEvZ2FuZ2Etcml2ZXItZG9scGhpbnMtY291bnQtcmlzZXMtdG8tMzMtdXAtZnJvbS0yMi1pbi0yMDE1L3N0b3J5LTdQSHRaS2VWaDhxM2d5R2RRaTFJT1AuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL20uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL25vaWRhL2dhbmdhLXJpdmVyLWRvbHBoaW5zLWNvdW50LXJpc2VzLXRvLTMzLXVwLWZyb20tMjItaW4tMjAxNS9zdG9yeS03UEh0WktlVmg4cTNneUdkUWkxSU9QX2FtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/10/18/Pictures/population-increased-available-department-conducted-arrangement-charmaine_d24d3004-d2b7-11e8-9a37-2776cb441552.jpg,2018-10-18,"{'sent': '15:02 IST\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['15:02'], 'ORG': ['IST']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"The huge loss is a tragedy in itself but also threatens the survival of civilisation, say the world’s leading scientists

Humanity has wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970, leading the world’s foremost experts to warn that the annihilation of wildlife is now an emergency that threatens civilisation.

The new estimate of the massacre of wildlife is made in a major report produced by WWF and involving 59 scientists from across the globe. It finds that the vast and growing consumption of food and resources by the global population is destroying the web of life, billions of years in the making, upon which human society ultimately depends for clean air, water and everything else.

“We are sleepwalking towards the edge of a cliff” said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF. “If there was a 60% decline in the human population, that would be equivalent to emptying North America, South America, Africa, Europe, China and Oceania. That is the scale of what we have done.”

“This is far more than just being about losing the wonders of nature, desperately sad though that is,” he said. “This is actually now jeopardising the future of people. Nature is not a ‘nice to have’ – it is our life-support system.”

“We are rapidly running out of time,” said Prof Johan Rockström, a global sustainability expert at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “Only by addressing both ecosystems and climate do we stand a chance of safeguarding a stable planet for humanity’s future on Earth.”

Many scientists believe the world has begun a sixth mass extinction, the first to be caused by a species – Homo sapiens. Other recent analyses have revealed that humankind has destroyed 83% of all mammals and half of plants since the dawn of civilisation and that, even if the destruction were to end now, it would take 5-7 million years for the natural world to recover.

The Living Planet Index, produced for WWF by the Zoological Society of London, uses data on 16,704 populations of mammals, birds, fish, reptiles and amphibians, representing more than 4,000 species, to track the decline of wildlife. Between 1970 and 2014, the latest data available, populations fell by an average of 60%. Four years ago, the decline was 52%. The “shocking truth”, said Barrett, is that the wildlife crash is continuing unabated.

Wildlife and the ecosystems are vital to human life, said Prof Bob Watson, one of the world’s most eminent environmental scientists and currently chair of an intergovernmental panel on biodiversity that said in March that the destruction of nature is as dangerous as climate change.

“Nature contributes to human wellbeing culturally and spiritually, as well as through the critical production of food, clean water, and energy, and through regulating the Earth’s climate, pollution, pollination and floods,” he said. “The Living Planet report clearly demonstrates that human activities are destroying nature at an unacceptable rate, threatening the wellbeing of current and future generations.”

The biggest cause of wildlife losses is the destruction of natural habitats, much of it to create farmland. Three-quarters of all land on Earth is now significantly affected by human activities. Killing for food is the next biggest cause – 300 mammal species are being eaten into extinction – while the oceans are massively overfished, with more than half now being industrially fished.

Chemical pollution is also significant: half the world’s killer whale populations are now doomed to die from PCB contamination. Global trade introduces invasive species and disease, with amphibians decimated by a fungal disease thought to be spread by the pet trade.

The worst affected region is South and Central America, which has seen an 89% drop in vertebrate populations, largely driven by the felling of vast areas of wildlife-rich forest. In the tropical savannah called cerrado, an area the size of Greater London is cleared every two months, said Barrett.

“It is a classic example of where the disappearance is the result of our own consumption, because the deforestation is being driven by ever expanding agriculture producing soy, which is being exported to countries including the UK to feed pigs and chickens,” he said. The UK itself has lost much of its wildlife, ranking 189th for biodiversity loss out of 218 nations in 2016.

The habitats suffering the greatest damage are rivers and lakes, where wildlife populations have fallen 83%, due to the enormous thirst of agriculture and the large number of dams. “Again there is this direct link between the food system and the depletion of wildlife,” said Barrett. Eating less meat is an essential part of reversing losses, he said.

The Living Planet Index has been criticised as being too broad a measure of wildlife losses and smoothing over crucial details. But all indicators, from extinction rates to intactness of ecosystems, show colossal losses. “They all tell you the same story,” said Barrett.

Conservation efforts can work, with tiger numbers having risen 20% in India in six years as habitat is protected. Giant pandas in China and otters in the UK have also been doing well.

But Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, said the fundamental issue was consumption: “We can no longer ignore the impact of current unsustainable production models and wasteful lifestyles.”

The world’s nations are working towards a crunch meeting of the UN’s Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020, when new commitments for the protection of nature will be made. “We need a new global deal for nature and people and we have this narrow window of less than two years to get it,” said Barrett. “This really is the last chance. We have to get it right this time.”

Tanya Steele, chief executive at WWF, said: “We are the first generation to know we are destroying our planet and the last one that can do anything about it.”","Humanity has wiped out 60% of animal populations since 1970, report finds",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEOrQyL4-4mOhyChkLMQoV4AqFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDlkko?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38166628f8bdb58897b2bd2c7a746c4ba06b1813/0_285_5018_3012/master/5018.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=d4ac103b4c56ca8ff267d5c785cb3d9f,2018-10-30,"{'sent': 'Humanity has wiped out 60% of mammals, birds, fish and reptiles since 1970, leading the world’s foremost experts to warn that the annihilation of wildlife is now an emergency that threatens civilisation.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Humanity']}}",Tiger
0,"In these bizarre skulls, McCurry saw a mystery. Many aquatic animals, from river dolphins to gharial crocodiles, have evolved long, toothy snouts to help them catch fish. But why did these particular dolphins take their snouts to such an extreme? In a curious twist, these species weren’t all part of the same lineage. Rather, they evolved from short-snouted ancestors on at least three different occasions, all during the Miocene period between 5 and 23 million years ago. “There must have been something going on in their environment at the same time to drive their evolution,” says McCurry.

To work out what that was, he first had to understand how these animals used their snouts. Working with Nick Pyenson, the Smithsonian’s expert on prehistoric whales, McCurry used a medical scanner to create digital models of the skulls of several long-snouted dolphins. He then analyzed those models with techniques that engineers use to measure the strength of beams and girders.

He found that the dolphins could easily have swept their snouts through the water at high speed, stunning fish in the way that modern billfishes like swordfish do. The different species likely used different techniques. Some, like Zarhachis, had flattened snouts, and probably swept the water from side to side at stunning speeds, just like today’s swordfish. Others, like Xiphiacetus, had snouts that were circular in cross section; like today’s marlins, they sacrificed a bit of speed for the ability to attack in any direction.

Crucially, these long-snouted species arose during a time in the middle of the Miocene when ocean temperatures started climbing. In cold water, warm-blooded predators like dolphins have an advantage over cold-blooded prey like fish or squid, because they’re better at maintaining a high metabolism and swimming at high speeds. As the oceans warm, fish can move faster and the dolphins’ advantage disappears. Perhaps some of them regained the upper hand by evolving long snouts that could swiftly sweep through shoals of prey.

During the mid-Miocene, sea levels also rose, flooding the shorelines and creating a variety of new shallow habitats. This varied coastal world effectively gave dolphins permission to be weirder. Some evolved massive underbites and perhaps used their lower jaws to skim through mud. Others developed walrus-like tusks, which they could have used to extract buried shellfish. And still others, of course, evolved extremely long snouts.

But this extraordinary period of evolutionary experimentation ended when the Miocene gave way to the Pliocene. Temperatures fell, the climate became more erratic, and the planet entered into a series of cycling ice ages. Creatures that evolved during the more stable climatic heyday disappeared. “That explains why we don’t have these weird, long-snouted dolphins around today,” says McCurry.

Studies like these are important because they highlight how the shapes of animals are shaped by their environment, and how much diversity can be lost when that environment changes, says Karina Amaral from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, who was not involved in the study. “At a time when many people insist on ignoring our changing climate,” she adds, this kind of research can help to paint a clear—and concerning—image of the consequences.

0,"India’s national aquatic animal is on the verge of extinction. The Gangetic Dolphin or the ‘Susu’ – so called for the sound it produces – is listed as an “endangered species” in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

Found in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river system of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh, the Gangetic river dolphin evolved almost 23-25 million years ago; it’s now identified as a unique sub-species – Platanista gangetica – of the South Asian river dolphin.

One of the earliest descriptions of this species comes from William Roxburgh, an eminent botanist who worked in the Godavari River delta in the 1780s.

AOL VIDEO Normally only two to four per cent of the African female elephant population would be born without tusks.

Other countries with a history of substantial ivory poaching are recording similar seismic shifts in how the elephants are being born.

In South Africa, the effect has been particularly extreme - 98 per cent of the 174 females in Addo Elephant National Park were reportedly tuskless in the early 2000s.

""The prevalence of tusklessness in Addo is truly remarkable and underscores the fact that high levels of poaching pressure can do more than just remove individuals from a population,"" says Ryan Long, an ecologist at the University of Idaho and a National Geographic Explorer.

The ""consequences of such dramatic changes in elephant populations are only just beginning to be explored,"" he believed.

National Geographic also reported that poaching has pushed tusk sizes down in some heavily hunted areas, such as southern Kenya.

But there's no decrease in the health of elephants being born without their tusks.

0,"The inauguration of the first multi-modal terminal on the Ganga River in Varanasi last month was publicised by the Centre as a major breakthrough in search for cheap mode of transport. It also was feted as major feat for generating employment in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s parliamentary constituency of Varanasi.

The cargo route is soon to be extended up to Allahabad aka Prayagraj. However, down the stream, the move has not generated much appreciation, as the stretch of river closer to the delta, especially as it flows east of Patna into Jharkhand and West Bengal before joining the Bay of Bengal, is home to the threatened Gangetic Dolphins, which ironically has been christened by the government as the National Aquatic Animal.

The NDA government enacted National Waterways Act, 2016, which declared 111 inland waterways as National Waterways (NWs) in addition to the five existing NWs across 24 states for utilising them as sustainable mode of transport. Of the total 111 inland waterways, 38 are habitat of the riverine dolphins.

So, in achieving the so-called development feat, ecological health of the rivers would stand to be compromised. Moreover, this move goes against the spirit of ‘Namami Gange’, under which the same government is spending millions to bring the river to its pristine glory by making it free from pollution and saving its biodiversity.

The commencement of Jal Marg Vikas Project (JMVP) aims at developing the stretch of the Ganga River between Varanasi and Haldia for navigation of large vessels weighing up to 1,500-2,000 tonnes.

This project includes construction of three multi-modal terminals (Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Sahibganj in Jharkhand and Haldia in West Bengal); two inter-modal terminals; five roll on-roll off terminal pairs; a new navigation lock at Farakka; assured depth dredging; integrated vessel repair and maintenance facility, differential global positioning system, river information system, river training and river conservancy works.

But what does this mean for the river, its waters and the creatures that live in it? River experts feel that it is a misnomer to say that inland water transport would be cheap. The most contentious issue is dredging of the river and its costs.

To allow ocean vessels to traverse a river, it should have a depth of 2 to 3 metres and a width of 45-60 metres, parameter that the Ganga River does not fulfil. The river will have to be dredged continuously which will cause severe erosion.

Besides erosion, dredging will destroy aquatic life of the river as dredging increases water turbidity, which affects fish.

It also affects benthic organisms that are creatures which live in and on the bottom of the river bed. They include worms, clams, crabs, lobsters, sponges, and many other tiny organisms that live in the nethermost sediments.

Several conservation groups have now planned a Sadbhavna Yatra from Varanasi to Gangasagar in West Bengal to create awareness about the threat posed by the inland waterways.

“The habitat of these aquatic flora (still to be sufficiently studied) and fauna especially in the sanctuaries will be altered due to dredging, river water pollution due to oil spillage and waste disposal activities which pose real challenges,” says Arvind Mishra, founder of Mandar Nature Club, which works extensively in the Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary near Bhagalpur.

“Riverine biodiversity concerns like threat to fish, turtles, gavial, otter, molluscs and crustaceans and dolphin and birds have not been considered properly while introducing intense water transport in the Ganga,” says Mishra.

There is also a need to understand that most of the ships on the Ganga River will be carrying cargo of mostly coal and crude oil. Spillage of these substances could cause irrevocable damage to the ecosystem of river.



Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had recently commissioned a research project to study about effects of transporting coal between Farakka and Haldia as thermal power plant at Farakka regularly needs coal and ships travel upriver from Haldia. The study revealed that coal transportation had severely affected fish stocks.

Big ships passing through the river would also cause lots of noise affecting fish and other wildlife mostly the Gangetic dolphin. This is common knowledge that river dolphins find their way through echolocation. Noise generated by these vessels would disturb their delicate Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) and affect them in such a way that cannot be assessed.

JMVP also plans construction of barrages and locks on the Ganga, which might reduce river flow at various stretches making things difficult for wildlife.



Gharial is another species that would be affected by this new venture as for Ganga is home for the fish-eating crocodile. Though Varanasi-Haldia stretch has a negligible population of gharials, Ganga tributaries like Yamuna, the Gandak and Ghagra have lots of them. The government has declared Gandak River to be the National Waterway 37.

Big vessels could disturb gharials, dredging would destroy mid-channel sand islands, vital to the animal for basking and regulating its body temperature. In case ships start plying the Gandak, it will be catastrophic for the gharial as scientists have already warned. Incidentally Varanasi itself is home to the famous turtle sanctuary.

Those supporting the inland waterways point towards their use in big global rivers like the Amazon, Yangtze and Mississippi that are regularly traversed by vessels. Even smaller rivers like the Clyde and Thames in the UK and the Elbe in Germany have ocean-going vessels plying in them.

The difference is that unlike them the Indian rivers are Monsoon-fed and do not have voluminous discharge of their own as these rivers. Moreover, high levels of water for navigation in Ganga and other Indian rivers are available only during the Monsoon months.

Chester Zoo's sub-tropical Monsoon Forest building - where a fire broke out on Saturday (December 15) - at Chester is the largest indoor zoo exhibit in UK history and has been open for just three years.

As well as a noticeable change in temperature, visitors to this extraordinary enclosure are greeted with the distinct call of the rhinoceros hornbill as they enter, and exotic plants in all shapes, sizes and the sound of a waterfall.

It's part of the £40m zoo Islands project - home to orangutans, macaques and the sunda gavial crocodile, an endangered species with only 2,500 mature individuals in existence.

This ambitious project, which recreates the exotic islands of South East Asia, first opened to the public in 2015 and has been a huge part of the continuing success at Chester Zoo ever since.

By S Suresh Ramanan

A five-year study conducted in the Sundarbans region has found that raising water salinity level is threatening the habitat of Gangetic river dolphins.

The survey was conducted in the lower stretch of river Hooghly, covering 97 km stretch of the western, central and eastern Sundarbans in India, intermittently between 2013 and 2016 in different seasons. Simultaneously, researchers also measured the salinity level of the water. Based on interaction with local fishing communities, the study area was demarcated for boat-based and land-based surveys.

Previous studies had recorded the natural distribution of the Gangetic dolphin in the Sundarbans regions but no continuous surveys were done to assess population and habitat changes.

It was found “no sighting record for Gangetic dolphin in waterways wherever the salinity level crosses 10 parts per trillion (ppt)”. The researchers believe that the rise in salinity in the eastern and central region of Sundarbans has affected the habitat of species. The increased salinity level is due to hydrological changes such as reduction in freshwater flow, reduced discharge from barrages, runoff from adjacent agricultural lands and river water abstraction for irrigation.

Rising salinity level seems to be conducive for marine cetaceans like Indo-Pacific hump-backed and Irrawaddy dolphins as these species can thrive in saline waters.

Other potential threats to the dolphin habitats are excessive fishing, use of vulnerable fishing gears, noise from motorized boats and lack of awareness among local communities. However, there is no data to assess the impact of these factors. Only long-term monitoring can give some answers.

“Gangetic dolphin is obligatory freshwater species and its range has declined oweing to salinity and other ecological factors. Although the study has not concluded, we would like to draw the attention of the concerned authorities as well as the public about threats to this freshwater habitat as it has a direct implication on Gangetic river dolphin,” said Sangita Mitra, a member of the research team, while speaking to India Science Wire.

Gangetic river dolphins are found in the rivers systems of Ganga, Brahmaputra, Meghna and Karnaphuli- Sangu in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. It is the only surviving freshwater dolphin in India.

The study results have been published in Journal of Threatened Taxa. The research team included Sangita Mitra (National Biodiversity Authority, Chennai) and Mahua Roy Chowdhury, a marine biologist from the University of Calcutta, West Bengal.

ISLAMABAD: Two blind Indus dolphins were rescued after being found stranded at Abul Canal in Khairpur district, local officials said on Wednesday.

According to sources, two blind dolphins were trapped in the canal for the last two days as all canals have been closed for annual cleaning. They were later released into the River Indus.

Earlier, two stranded blind Indus dolphins were rescued from Ghotki and Kamber and released back into the river.

According to World Wide Fund, a team of WWF and wildlife department rescued a dolphin in Sukkur on Friday.

The dolphin was spotted at Dahar Wah near Yaroo Lund in Ghotki district. The mammal was rescued and later released in the Indus River near Katcho Bhindi.

According to the wildlife department, 700 dolphins populate the waters between Guddu and Sukkur barrage. A blind dolphin rescue centre has been established at the Sukkur barrage to ensure swift rescue in the event of such an incident.

A WWF study said the number of the endangered Indus River dolphin, also known as Bulhan is on the rise, a significant positive development despite pollution threat.

Indus river dolphin is declared endangered by the IUCN red list status and is also considered as the second most endangered freshwater dolphins in the world. It is one of only four species of dolphin that spend all their lives in freshwater.

0,"The population of gharials (Gavialis gangeticus), a crocodilian endemic to the Indian subcontinent, has gone up in the Gandak river in Bihar.

Three surveys in 2017 and 2018 recorded about 211 gharials of different age-groups present in the river, as compared to merely 15 recorded in 2010.

A joint conservation initiative between the Wildlife Trust of India and the Bihar Forest Department released captive bred gharials into the Gandak in 2014.

However, the thriving gharials are facing problems due to the Gandak barrage and fishing nets.

Lalsa Yadav gushes with a big smile on his face every time he spots a gharial in the river Gandak, that flows through West Champaran district of Bihar, bordering Nepal.

He tries to take his rickety boat close to the adult gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) enjoying a sun-bath in a chilly wintery afternoon, but they disappear into the deep water. He oars his boat further with the hope of seeing more of the large-sized reptiles in the river.

“Contrary to popular belief, they are very shy by nature and escape inside water even on slight disturbance. The river has quite a number of gharials nowadays which has made it easy to spot them. We are lucky to have them,” he says with a sense of pride. Gharials are members of the crocodile family, historically found in various parts of the Indian sub-continent.

The 50-year-old fisherman with a strong body and bulging muscles has every reason to feel proud. After all, he has worked tirelessly with conservation experts and administration to protect and bring back the population of gharials from the brink of extinction, in the river Gandak, a transnational river between India and Nepal and a tributary of river Ganga.

“We [the fishing community] have played a big role along with the authorities to save the reptiles that were in the danger of being hunted down or eggs getting washed away due to sand bank erosion,” he said.

“The efforts have paid off as gharials can now be easily spotted in the river because of the increase in their population,” he continued, pointing to two sub-adults at the far-end of the river.

Indeed, the population of gharials has witnessed an upward spiral in the Gandak that now houses the second largest population in the country, after the river Chambal (National Chambal Sanctuary) stretch that covers Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, claim those involved in its conservation.

A remarkable increase

Based on three surveys done by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) between 2017 and 2018, around 211 gharials of different age-groups are present in the river as compared to merely 15 recorded in 2010.

The WTI conducted three continuous surveys in the entire stretch of the Gandak river in 2017-18. In the survey conducted from February 4-11 2017, 119 gharials were sighted in the entire stretch of the river. In 2018, two consecutive surveys (February 9-17 and 21-27) documented 148 and 166 gharials respectively in the same stretch. Around 40 hatchlings have been sighted in 2018 after the survey so experts expect the number to increase this year.

The findings have brought cheer to conservationists as the gharial is a critically endangered species. Endemic to the Indian subcontinent, the gharial is the most aquatic of all extant crocodilians and resides in flowing rivers with deep pools, high sand banks and good fish stocks.

Its distribution range has shrunk significantly and currently it occupies only about two percent of the former range. Old references indicate that the gharial was widespread across the Indian subcontinent: it was common in the Indus river in Pakistan, Gandak river in Nepal (locally known as Narayani), Jumuna river in Uttar Pradesh and Kosi river in Bihar. It was also found in Burma (now Myanmar), Bhutan and Bangladesh. In India, the gharials are now found mainly in Chambal, Girwa, Ghagra and Gandak river basins.

The population has registered a 98 percent decline between 1946 and 2006; the adult population nosedived, with a 58 percent reduction across its range in just nine years, starting from 1997. The reason for the decline has been attributed to over-hunting for skins and trophies, egg collection for consumption, killing for indigenous medicine and excessive and irreversible loss of the species habitat.

In such a scenario, presence of the second largest population of the critically endangered gharials in the Gandak river becomes important for conservation of the species.",Gharials of Gandak: A population back from the brink faces development pressures,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWEubW9uZ2FiYXkuY29tLzIwMTkvMDEvZ2hhcmlhbHMtb2YtZ2FuZGFrLWEtcG9wdWxhdGlvbi1iYWNrLWZyb20tdGhlLWJyaW5rLWZhY2VzLWRldmVsb3BtZW50LXByZXNzdXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2019/01/14122205/Header3-768x512.png,2019-01-14,"{'sent': 'The population of gharials (Gavialis gangeticus), a crocodilian endemic to the Indian subcontinent, has gone up in the Gandak river in Bihar.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Gavialis'], 'GPE': ['Bihar']}}",Gharial
0,"File Photo : Modi's Namami Gange Programme Falters

Remember ‘Namami Gange’ — the Modi government’s much-vaunted programme for cleaning up and reviving the dwindling flows of our national river Ganga, with a budget outlay of Rs. 20,000 crore?

The stated goals of the programme — implemented by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) under the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation — were to ensure “the cleanliness, purity and uninterrupted flow of the Ganga on priority”.

Or, as Scroll puts it, to “ensure nirmalta (purity) and aviralta (continuous flow)” of the Ganga.

But four and a half years after the BJP-led NDA’s launched the ‘flagship programme’, it is apparent that the national river is in more troubled waters than ever — as a three-part investigative series published on Scroll elaborates (first, second, and third).

Privatising Pollution Control

To begin with, the Modi government’s plan to clean up the Ganga entails privatising the collection and treatment of sewage in 97 cities and towns that lie along the river.

In 2015, water ministry secretary Shashi Shekhar and his team proposed “a hybrid annuity model”, whereby private companies would build and operate sewage treatment plants for 15 years, and then hand them over to the state governments.

The central government would pay 40 per cent of the bid amount in the beginning and the rest as annual payments over the length of the contract, but the payments would have been linked to the quality of the treated water. And the treated water was not to be released back in to the river but to be sold to entities that did not require fresh water, for example, municipal corporations or thermal power plants.

However, this model ran into political opposition and the project did not see any progress. In a December 2017 report, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) pointed out that as of March 31, 2017, all of the funds—Rs. 19,814 crore—allocated to the Clean Ganga mission were lying unused.

Then in 2017, after Nitin Gadkari took over the water ministry, he changed Shashi Shekhar’s approach by introducing the “one city, one operator” model — replacing the earlier provision for multiple private companies handling sewage treatment plants with the new policy that a single private company would oversee the collection and treatment of sewage in an entire city.

“But redirecting sewage is difficult,” noted Scroll. “Large parts of Indian cities have come up without sewer lines. For instance, Patna, which covers 235 sq km on the south bank of the Ganga and accounts for close to 60% of all domestic sewage flowing into the Ganga in Bihar, has no more than 20 kilometres of sewer lines. In Kanpur, no more than 30% of the city has a sewer system,” the report further stated.

Besides, the NMCG will not construct sewer systems in most cities. “Instead, it will build wiers on drains before they empty into the river – and pump their sewage into treatment plants.” The treated water will go to either industry or agriculture.

The effluent quality will be monitored by sensors. In fact, the NMCG has created a separate cell for monitoring water quality at the Central Pollution Control Board.

However, this privatisation model, which is being implemented without a pilot project first, has already failed in Gujarat.

Scroll said the primary reason for this failure was “acute understaffing at the state pollution control board, which hamstrung attempts to check how the plants were functioning.”

And this problem of inadequate government supervision and scrutiny will remain with the “one city, one operator” model, as the “lack of state capacity to monitor the data on water quality could result in the same outcomes as before.”

Damming the Flows of the River

While on the one hand, the Modi government speaks of reviving the Ganga and ensuring uninterrupted flow, on the other it has revived and approved dams as part of hydel power projects with zero consideration for the ecological damage and destruction they cause.

“Since 2002, Uttarakhand, where the Ganga originates, has been on a drive to build hydel power projects. The state, which currently produces 4,000 MW of hydel power from 98-odd projects, has since 2009 signed agreements to build another 350 dams,” Scroll noted.

What’s more, most of these dams are diversion dams, “which block the river and divert its water through tunnels to turbines that generate electricity. The river rejoins its original course only after passing over the turbines, leaving riverbeds dry between the dam wall and the tunnel’s outlet.” Running through tunnels for hydel power projects, the state’s rivers that feed the Ganga and the aquifers they recharged had dried up.

Blasting during the construction of dams and tunnels led to the drying of mountain aquifers as well, in turn making it difficult for local communities to survive. Also, the fragmentation of rivers led to dying of fish such as the golden mahseer.

What’s worse, in the highly ecologically sensitive region of the Himalayas, the new hydroelectric power projects increase the risk of cloudbursts — such as in 2013 in Kedarnath which caused flash floods and landslides killing thousands of people.

A number of measures by the previous government and decisions by courts had been taken keeping these concerns in mind.

For example, in 2010, the Congress-led UPA had cancelled three hydel projects in Uttarakhand while declaring a 100-km stretch of the Bhagirathi, from Gaumukh to Uttarkashi, an eco-sensitive zone.

“Two years later, environmental studies ordered by the Uttarakhand High Court proposed a minimum distance between hydel projects and suggested that each dam be required to release enough water for a river to perform its ecological functions. This is called ‘environmental flow’, or e-flow.”

A study by the Wildlife Institute of India had recommended that 24 proposed hydel projects on the Alaknanda and the Bhagirathi be cancelled, and the recommendations were later endorsed by two committees.

Then in August 2013 floods, the Supreme Court banned new hydel power projects in Uttarakhand.

But the Ganga-loving BJP after coming to power rolled back nearly all of these measures. After all, “Dams and highways are how politicians make money in Uttarakhand,” as a former environment ministry official anonymously told Scroll.

In January 2015, the environment ministry again started supporting hydel projects, “even in the upper reaches of the Ganga which all reports recommended should remain untouched.”

For example, in February, the ministry submitted an affidavit to the Supreme Court “stating a four-member panel it had set up found six of the dams flagged by the Wildlife Institute had obtained environmental and forest clearances in accordance with the rules and regulations.”

But the panel actually had warned against permitting these dams, and yet the environment ministry “selectively quoted from the report – only telling the court these six projects had all the clearances.”

As outrage poured over in the media by environmentalists, the ministry in May 2015 set up another committee to evaluate these six projects.

However, in October, the committee gave the go-ahead to these six projects.

“That same month, on the insistence of the Uttarakhand government, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra reduced the Supreme Court’s 2013 ban on all hydel projects, limiting it to the 24 projects flagged by the Wildlife Institute in its 2012 report. The ministry did not object,” the report said.

In January 2016, the ministry told the apex court that projects releasing at least 1,000 cubic feet per second of water into the Ganga and its tributaries would be allowed. However, in July, this decision was challenged by the Ministry of Water Resources insisting that all 24 projects be reviewed. The matter is still pending before the Supreme Court

A total of 450 hydel projects had been proposed in Uttarakhand by 2014, mostly without being subjected to a proper cost-benefit analysis and without considering any of the environmental costs and damages.

In 2015, the Supreme Court allowed construction of dams on all rivers except the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi. “Instead of opposing the order, the environment ministry tried to reduce that number further down to 18,” the report noted. The government instead of focusing on environmental flows, have actually added to the drying of the river before it even reaches Bihar.

The government’s affidavit to the Supreme Court submitted in December 2014 had suggested 30%-50% environmental flows during non-monsoon months. But on October 1, 2018, the government published new guidelines reducing the mandated e-flow in the Upper Ganga basin till Haridwar to 20% (average monthly flow) between November and March, 25% in October, April and May, and 30% between June and September.

As activists told Scroll, this is far from enough to meet local requirements. These stipulations of the government indicated that there was pressure to divert water for hydel power in the hills and irrigation in the plains.

And then in 2016, the Modi government decided to allow dams in the Bhagirathi eco-sensitive zone.

Three Infrastructure Projects

Besides allowing the rampant construction of hydel power projects, the Modi government is rolling three infrastructure projects that will not only further pollute the river and decrease water flows into it, but also denude its catchment areas and endanger its biodiversity around it.

Around 400 million people inhabit the Indo-Gangetic plain, besides the precious biodiversity and Gangetic species.

While the gharial and Gangetic dolphin are on the brink of extinction, “catches of fish from rivers of the Ganga basin have declined by 90% in the last 40 years, while otter numbers have dropped by a third over the last 30 years.” The future of these species depends on the future of the Ganga and its tributaries.

The three infrastructure projects are — the Char Dham Pariyojana, the Inland Waterways project, and the Ken-Betwa river linking project.

While the Char Dham and the Inland Waterways projects have been approved without any environmental scrutiny, the Ken-Betwa link has been approved with total disregard to the environmental destruction.

The Char Dham project cuts through rocks of the lesser and the greater Himalayas, contributing to making the mountains unstable.

Besides, around 33,000 trees would be felled in the process, even though there is a need to plant more trees for strengthening Ganga’s catchment areas.

In 2013, the environment ministry had said that expansion work covering up to 100 km on national highways would not require environmental clearances, nor would land acquisition up to “40 meters on existing alignment [roads] and 60 meters on bypasses”.

Also Read: Uttarakhand’s Chardham Project, a Saga of ‘Untruths’, ‘Blatant Lies’ and Ecological ‘Fraud’?

Cleverly, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways announced that the Char Dham was not a single 900-km stretch but a series of 53 individual projects, separated by 16 bypasses, with none of these individual projects exceeding 100 km in length or 40 metres in width.

The ministry’s claim was challenged before the National Green Tribunal. Calling the government’s claim fraudulent, an NGO called Citizens for Green Doon pointed out that the project covered continuous stretches far longer than 100 km, spread over five national highways.

The Inland Waterways project was proposed by Gadkari, and in 2016, the BJP government passed the National Waterways Act, which would have several consequences not just for the river flows but the ports as well as the riverine ecosystem.

“The law has three components – riverine ports, channels along which ships will move, and the ships themselves. Ports pollute and alter river flows. Channels require dredging to ensure ships do not run aground,” as Scroll says.

But dredging on river beds “dislodges river sediment, destroys breeding grounds of fish as well as habitats of endangered species like freshwater turtles and other aquatic life.”

Moreover, “the noise and disturbance caused by dredging and as mechanised ships move along the river will hurt biodiversity as well.”

For example, it would further endanger the existence of the Ganges dolphin, “a blind mammal which uses echolocation (like bats) to forage in and navigate the Ganga-Brahmaputra system. Nearly 90% of the dolphin’s population lives along stretches marked for waterways in the two basins.”

In 2016, when the Inland Waterways project was supposed to go through the environmental impact assessment process of the environment ministry, the shipping ministry argued that the project’s multimodal terminals did not qualify as ports or harbours.

It argued that the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification of 2006 applied only to oceanic ports, not inland waterways. The law ministry sided with this assessment, as The Indian Express reported in May, 2016.

In May 2017, the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee insisted that an environmental impact assessment of the project needed to be done. “However, as The Hindu reported, after Gadkari met the then Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan in October 2017, the green ministry relented and said an environmental clearance was not needed,” the Scroll reported.

As for the Ken-Betwa linking, it entails a dam in the middle of the Panna Tiger Reserve in Madhya Pradesh, which will not only “cut the reserve into two and submerge ledges where India’s endangered vultures breed, it will also result in the loss of about 10 lakh trees. The reserve itself will lose as much as 5,578 hectares of land from its core and buffer zones.”

Moreover, as water from the Ken is diverted to the Betwa, “it will reduce flows into the Yamuna, which joins the Ganga downstream in Allahabad”, threatening the biodiversity in the Ken Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary which lies just downstream of the proposed dam.

The Ken-Betwa project was given the green light despite environmentalists raising major red flags as to “its heavy environmental and wildlife costs”.

It takes 30 to 40 years to restore a river, as a water ministry bureaucrat anonymously told Scroll.

But it is not just a question of time, but of intentions — it is clear that all the noise around reviving the “holy river” of Ganga is only part of the Modi government’s ‘nationalistic’ rhetoric as he continues to compromise the national river’s future at a rate more accelerated than ever.","Ganga in Deeper Troubled Waters Than Ever, So Much for Modi’s ‘Namami Gange’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NjbGljay5pbi9nYW5nYS1kZWVwZXItdHJvdWJsZWQtd2F0ZXJzLWV2ZXItc28tbXVjaC1tb2Rpcy1uYW1hbWktZ2FuZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.newsclick.in/sites/default/files/2019-01/ganga_0.PNG,2019-01-23,"{'sent': 'Remember ‘Namami Gange’ — the Modi government’s much-vaunted programme for cleaning up and reviving the dwindling flows of our national river Ganga, with a budget outlay of Rs.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Modi'], 'PERSON': ['Ganga']}}",Gharial

The Amur tiger cubs that were born in Dublin Zoo last year — the first time in over 20 years that the world’s biggest cats were born in captivity — made a public appearance over the weekend. After a gestation period of 15 weeks, the two female cubs were born to first-time mother Tundra on October 14. The cubs weighed approximately 1.5 kg (3.3 lb) each then; they have now grown to 15 kg (33 lb) each.

Dublin Zoo announced on Instagram: “In case you missed our exciting news, Dublin Zoo is thrilled to announce the birth of two Amur tiger cubs to first-time parents Tundra and Ussuri!”

The Zoo authorities have invited suggestions to name the cubs. “To celebrate the birth of the cubs, Dublin Zoo is inviting YOU to suggest a name for the new arrivals based on their Russian origins. Name suggestions can be submitted at and the winners will receive a family day pass to visit Dublin Zoo on a date of their choice,” it said.

Amur tigers, which were earlier called Siberian tigers, are listed as an endangered species with fewer than 550 of the cats believed to be living in the wild. Amur tigers were once found across the Russian Far East, northern China and the Korean peninsula.

In the 1940s, extensive hunting drove the species to the brink of extinction, with no more than 40 tigers remaining in the wild. However, their numbers began to increase after Russia became the first country to grant them protection. At present, Amur Tigers are mostly found in Amur Valley.

Amur tigers are the largest and heaviest of all cats with the thickest fur, whose only predators are human beings. In spite of being protected, the cats are killed for their fur and body parts which are used in some traditional medicines and ornaments.

Last December, 11 Amur tigers were spotted in the upper reaches of the Dibang Valley in Arunachal Pradesh. A survey by WWF and Global Tiger Forum showed the presence of the species, including two cubs, at the Dibang Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the Dibang Valley District and surrounded by China in the north and east.

A census of wildlife in a 1,000-kilometre stretch of the Ganga and its two tributaries in Bihar indicates a ""thriving"" population of Gangetic river dolphins in the region.

Some experts have called it a sign of a ""healthy river ecosystem"" since the threatened dolphin species is known to survive in a clean, freshwater environment. Their numbers have increased significantly since 2009, when the Gangetic dolphin was declared India's National Aquatic Animal.

Good news for India's river dolphin population...or is it? @wti_org_india & Zoological Survey of India found record number of Gangetic dolphins in their census. Is Ganga really healthy or is the data inaccurate? @woman_rednow has got the deets. @tech2eets pic.twitter.com/0RINLTkHcu — Gadgetwala (@ankitv) February 20, 2019

Gangetic dolphins along a 1000-km stretch of the Ganga were surveyed by a team of researchers from the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) and Tilka Manjhi University in Bhagalapur, Orissa. ZSI described what they found over the three-week study as a ""thriving"" population of Gangetic dolphins along that particular stretch of river in Bihar, Hindustan Times reported.

""We have found about 1,150 dolphins in these rivers during our extensive survey which lasted about a month and we think the population is stable,"" Gopal Sharma, Deputy Director of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) told Down to Earth.

The ""extensive"" survey lasted 23 days, during which time a large number of threatened Gangetic dolphins were counted along simultaneous, 300-kilometre segments of the Ganga. The stretches included two tributaries of the Ganga — the Gandak and Ghaghara — in Bihar, the Times report added.

And while the survey was done simultaneously in all three segments of the river, researchers used a direct 'visual count' of dolphins to estimate how many there were. Each was counted based on their size and height as they came up to the surface to breathe. While the report is still being prepared and yet to be released by the government, researchers haven't confirmed if the dolphin numbers are significant yet.

Whether it has increased or decreased in recent years is difficult to say because this is the first survey of such a scale to been carried out for the river, Sharma told Down to Earth.

But researchers from ZSI do think their findings are telling of the health of the Ganga for its marine life.

""I am happy to inform that the river Ganga is alive in this part of Bihar. The river water quality here is relatively better than upper stream, though pollution danger persists,"" Sunil Kumar Choudhary, coordinator of Vikramshila Biodiversity Research and Education Centre in Bhagalpur, told Down to Earth.

""The presence of dolphins in good numbers says it all,"" he added.

Dolphins are highly intelligent aquatic animals that have an important role to play in ecology. If a dolphin is sick, injured or dead, it is a strong indicator that their aquatic environments are unsafe and unhealthy for marine life (and humans, for that matter).

According to a WWF estimate, there are fewer than 3,000 freshwater or river dolphins in the world — of which around 2,000 are in India. Bihar currently has the biggest population of Gangetic dolphins in any single region worldwide.

Dolphins are among the most vulnerable species on Earth, their population still on the decline. The findings of this study could (tentatively) be a big win for Bihar. The Wildlife Trust of India's (WTI's) inputs from the survey are expected soon. They are yet to submit their findings to the government, according to a recent tweet.

They shared with us that their Gangetic dolphin counts were not as high in some parts of the Ganga as ZSI's.

The comprehensive, first-of-its-kind survey also studied other aquatic fauna. The team also studied 45 different species of endangered and migratory birds as well as several species of fish.

0,"The results of the recent and most extensive elephant population survey of Botswana estimates the country’s population at 126 000 elephants, a further decline from 131 600 reported in 2014. According to Conservation Action Trust, the report shows repeated evidence of significant increases in elephant poaching in four hotspots in Northern Botswana, which started a media storm last year

This report by Elephants without Borders (EWB) comes after the cabinet sub-committee presented their pro hunting report to President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Thursday last week, which proposes not only lifting the hunting ban, but also the introduction of regular elephant culling and associated elephant meat canning industry for pet food, as well as closing certain wildlife migratory routes.

Botswana government earlier submitted a proposal to CITES in preparation for the CoP18 meeting in May this year, asking to amend the CITES listing of the African savannah elephant to allow for trade in hunting trophies, live animals and registered (government-owned) stocks of raw ivory.

According to the African Elephant Status report (2016), Botswana’s elephant population declined by 15% in the preceding 10 years. This report clearly shows that Botswana’s elephant population is not increasing, as is often suggested in political and hunting corridors. Although its population is still the largest in Southern Africa, it’s actually 100 000 less than the 237 000 often quoted by politicians and the media in Botswana. In attempts to justify culling and hunting.

The EWB elephant population of 126 000 is based on a region-wide aerial survey, covering a larger area than any previous study by EWB. The joint EWB and DWNP team flew over a period of 62 days, recording more than 32 000 km of transects and covering over 100 000 km2 of Botswana, including and surrounding Wildlife Management Areas, Okavango Delta and Moremi Game Reserve, and the pastoral areas in Ngamiland, Chobe and the Central Districts.

Four elephant poaching hotspots revealed in Northern Botswana

Since the last survey in 2014, the EWB research team discovered a steep increase in the number of fresh and recent elephant carcasses, i.e. elephants that died within the last year of both natural causes and poaching.

The EWB team confirmed that of the 128 elephant carcasses less than one year old, 72 were confirmed either on the ground or by aerial assessment as killed by poachers and an additional 22 from survey photographs as poaching victims. In addition, 79 older than one-year carcasses were assessed in one particular hotspot, of which 63 were confirmed as poached. The all-age carcass ratio increased from 6.8% to 8.1% between 2014 and 2018, generally accepted as indicating an elephant population that could be declining.

The elephant remains all show the graphic evidence of poaching with a similar modus operandi. Poachers shoot the animals with high calibre rifles when they come to drink at remote seasonal pans. If the elephant doesn’t die immediately, one of the poachers immobilises it by damaging the spinal cord with an axe. Their tusks are hacked away, severely damaging the skull, the trunk is often removed from the face, and the carcass is covered in cut branches in an attempt to hide the dead animal.

The poachers seem to operate in a certain area, targeting the bulls with large tusks, before moving on to the next site. They are in no apparent rush, as a poacher’s camp was also discovered close to one of the carcass clusters.

The ground verification team established that the vast majority of poached elephants are indeed bulls between the age 35-45 years old. This also corresponds with evidence in the report that the bull population has decreased from 21 600 individuals in 2014 to 19 400 in 2018.

WATCH: Botswana govt rubbishes elephant poaching reports

The poaching appears predominately in four hotspots in Northern Botswana – the area between the Pan Handle and Caprivi Strip, in and around the Savuti section of Chobe including Khwai and Linyanti, near Maun, and in the area between Chobe and Nxai Pan.

A panel of nine independent elephant scientists reviewed the EWB report and found the science to be rock solid. One member stated, “this is a very thorough and carefully documented report demonstrating exceptionally high rigor”.

Nevertheless, the Botswana government still attempts to cast doubt on various issues detailed in the report, as part of a confusing political campaign. EWB strongly refutes the government claims and says they find it regrettable that the government have not contacted them directly to discuss the report. In addition to the many elephant fatalities, 13 rhinos were killed by poachers in just 11 months in Botswana, three of which were in the Okavango Delta.

The surge in wildlife poaching is alarming, but sadly not unique to Botswana. Dr Iain Douglas-Hamilton, member of the reviewing panel, says “in my view [the EWB] count showing that elephant poaching has increased to a greater level than previously thought, raises the possibility that further escalations are possible”.

Another member adds, “it is safe to say that, if the observed poaching trend continues, there could be a significant decrease in elephant populations.

Amidst indications about increase in the number of highly endangered Dolphins in the Ganga, which suggests improvement in the river water quality, there is also a big concern.

Experts feel Centre’s ambitious inland waterway plan, which will make heavy cargo ships ply through the Ganga, will have a detrimental impact on the Mammals, declared the National Aquatic Animal in 2009. The fairway is ready for the ships.

In 2016, Bihar government had opposed any move to develop national waterways, as it could further devastate heavily silted Ganga and lead to more flooding. However, with the JD-U and the BJP together now, the issue has died down.

But for Dolphin researchers Prof RK Sinha, who got Padma Shree in 2016, and Prof Sunil Kumar Choudhary of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University, ship movement would certainly have an impact on the river ecology and the Dolphins, which have just started showing signs of stabilization. They warn against Yangtze river situation, where Dolphins became extinct in 2006 due to heavy traffic.

“For movement of cargo ships, the Ganga will require constant dredging, which will disturb habitat of Dolphins. The heavy sound of ships and waves may disorient them, as the mammals, being blind, emit ultrasonic waves and use their echoes to identify the location of objects or fish they cannot see. They also collide with objects to form an image in their mind. Colliding with ships can be dangerous. They can also develop physiological disorder,” said Choudhary.

Vinod Kumar Kureel, chief engineer of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), Patna said the fairway (around 35-40 metre wide stretch with average depth of around 2.5 metres in the Ganga with adequate depth) for the ships had been complete and it was for the private operators to use it whenever they feel it proper.

“We are just a development agency and we have completed the fairway for the cargo vessels to move through it. Our ships are plying and we also spot Dolphins playing. The entire project will be completed in 2022, when ships will get better depth. Work is being done only after obtaining all environment clearances and as per laid down guidelines,” he added.

On concerns over ecological impact, Kureel said it was natural with any development project, but there is always a conscious effort to minimize it. “Making national waterway functional is a conscious decision of the government and all precautions are being taken by various agencies for it. River is a dynamic system, unlike roads, and it requires dredging from time to time. It is a continuous process and we avoid dredging where Dolphins are seen.” he added.

IWAI came into existence in 1986. However, after 2014 its work gathered momentum as the Narendra Modi government focused on waterways development and now there are 111 declared waterways. This includes seven of the Bihar rivers, including the Ganga.

Kureel said that the pilots help vessels go through the fairway so that they don’t get stuck in shallow water. “New environment-friendly technology is also being worked out to minimise dredging. We also go in for bandalling, which uses bamboo made structure for the river course stabilization. In areas with dolphin population, we are more cautious,” he added.

River expert Dinesh Kumar Mishra, however, said that he could only hope that an environmental impact assessment had been done prior to pushing for waterway. “We don’t know what has been done, but we certainly know that ship movement would have impact on river ecology, as the river bed also gets disturbed. The consequences may manifest after some time in more ways than one,” he added.

Mishra said that Bihar had witnessed the fury of embankments, with the flood-prone area increasing from 25-lakh hectares to around 73-lakh hectares. “The focus on river transport is to minimize vehicular pollution, but is there a mechanism to monitor the outcome. Ganga is in bad shape, as it does not have adequate water. With rainfall also constantly falling, it could get worse. Ships can float on water only. What is important is to fix accountability for such huge investments,” he added.

Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, who holds the portfolio of environment ministry also, said all steps would be initiated to protect the highly endangered Dolphins and it was exactly for this purpose that India’s first National Dolphin Research Centre, sanctioned by the erstwhile Planning Commission in 2013, was coming up in Patna. A memorandum between the Patna University and the Bihar state disaster management authority (BSDMA) was signed on February 18 and the foundation stone is likely to be laid soon.

Nalanda Open University VC RK Sinha, popularly called Dolphin man for his extensive work on the mammal that fetched him Padma Shree Award in 2016, said at a time when there were encouraging signs about stabilization of Dolphin population and improvement in the Ganga water, it was all the more important to take necessary precautions beforehand.

“In 2006, the Baiji or Chinese river Dolphin, was declared extinct in the Yangtze river, the first of a large mammal species and scientists attributed it to heavy river traffic. It is important that we keep it in mind,” said Sinha.

Sinha and Choudhary had also been invited for talks at the IWAI in 2016 and both said that they had raised concerns. “There have been instances of Dolphins getting killed due to propellers in the country boats. We had recommended propeller guards. The ships will also need to do some innovation. Flat bottom ships will cause less danger to mammals. Ganga Dolphins are blind, but have strong sense of echo location,” said Sinha.

The concerns are significant as over half the river Dolphin population is in Bihar, where the state government-sponsored first-ever planned population estimation survey of the mammals in the Ganga and its two main tributaries Gandak and Ghagra by Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), Zoological Survey of India and TM Bhagalpur University has just been completed, though a final report will be submitted to the Bihar government in March-end only. At present analysis of the data is going on.

In the Ganga, the survey was carried out in two stretches. One 300-km stretch was from Buxar to Mokama, done by the team of Gopal Sharma, regional head of the Zoological Survey of India. It recorded around 300 Dolphins. The second stretch was around 278-km stretch from Mokama to Manihari, which found the number to be tentatively around 765. Besides, the third survey covered Ganga’s tributaries the Gandak and Ghagra.

Environmentalist Prof Ashok Ghosh, chairman of the Bihar state pollution control board (BSPCB), said there were clear indicators of improvement in the water quality in the Ganga in the last four-five months. “Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report has also corroborated the BSPCB report about improvement at three major points along the Bihar stretch of the Ganga at Buxar, Mokama and Munger, vis-à-vis biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO) and fecal coliform (FC). We are yet to release the data, but we will do so soon after further analysis,” he added.

Ghosh said the improvement in water quality in UP had impact in Bihar and once the Bihar STPs would start functioning, it would improve further. “On our part, we have made zero discharge of industrial wastes into the river. Action has also been taken against industries under orange and red categories. We continue with regular monitoring of the river water quality,” he added.

Experts, however, feel Ganga water quality in the Bihar stretch is relatively better, as four cleaner Himalayan rivers flow into the Ganga from Nepal. “In Bihar, not much work under Namami Gange project has been completed till now, but efforts have begun to stop effluents flowing into the river and once all the seweage treatment plants (STPs) start working, water quality could improve further. At present, water quality in UP has improved and that is also contributing to Ganga’s health,” he added.

Sameer Kumar Sinha, head of the Species Recovery Division at WTI, said it is a fact that better water quality is conducive to Dolphins’ growth. “We hope for a better count, but the exact figures will be known after the report is submitted,” he added.",Scare for Dolphins as Ganga gets ready for cargo ships,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9wYXRuYS9zY2FyZS1mb3ItZG9scGhpbnMtYXMtZ2FuZ2EtZ2V0cy1yZWFkeS1mb3ItY2FyZ28tc2hpcHMvc3RvcnktQXFpN045dXpTUnZzZ0hOT3FVYmhLTy5odG1s0gF_aHR0cHM6Ly9tLmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9wYXRuYS9zY2FyZS1mb3ItZG9scGhpbnMtYXMtZ2FuZ2EtZ2V0cy1yZWFkeS1mb3ItY2FyZ28tc2hpcHMvc3RvcnktQXFpN045dXpTUnZzZ0hOT3FVYmhLT19hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/03/01/Pictures/ttourists-seater-avail-dolphin-hours-sanctuary-photo_2aacbfe8-3bd2-11e9-bdc1-734f7b7cfb0c.jpg,2019-03-01,"{'sent': 'patna\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['patna']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"National Chambal Sanctuary is perhaps the only park in North India that is a tri-state entity. Located on Chambal river, the park sits on the tri-point of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Interestingly, there’s hardly any industrial town in the vicinity which has essentially contributed to the river Chambal being one of North India’s cleanest rivers. That subsequently, has helped this place to be home to a vast array of fauna. Today, Chambal’s deadly predators are the critically endangered freshwater gharials and red-crowned roof turtles and endangered Ganges river dolphin.

There’s good news for enthusiastic bird-watchers as well; this is the most famous place to spot the threatened Indian skimmers. And between November and March, you can spot ample migratory birds, such as the ruddy shelducks and bar-headed geese. If you’re one for wildlife, Chambal Sanctuary is indeed a paradise to catch a glimpse of rare animal species. The sanctuary offers great peace and tranquility; there’s plenty of fresh air amidst lush green meadows.

The best thing to do here is enjoy a river safari in the afternoon. In the course of your boat ride, along with spotting many birds and aquatic animals, you’ll also get ample opportunities to click stunning photographs. Another thing to try is the camel safari in the ravines of Chambal; chase blackbucks with the setting sun; or simply take a nature walk.

The best time to visit is between October and March because the weather is exceptionally pleasant then, and the chances of spotting wildlife are much higher compared to the scorching summer. The nearest airport to the sanctuary is in Gwalior which is connected with regular flights from Delhi and Bhopal. The nearest railway station is also at Gwalior, though Agra station is also very close to the sanctuary.

0,"Have you started training sessions with Nikita?

Nikita has started training sessions with me, though she is still a bit nervous and guarded. Part of her training is just getting used to our animal care team and desensitizing her to the new environment. All of the husbandry training that we do with our cats is completely voluntary. It is always up to the animal whether they choose to participate or not. If they do, they receive positive reinforcement in the form of a treat—typically a meatball or beef chunk.

The first training we did was with the target buoy; she has to touch her nose to the buoy in order to receive a reward. This lets me get a good look at her body and make sure she has no injuries that our veterinarians need to address.

When she is in estrus, she is super-friendly and the sweetest cat. But she is so interested in playing that she doesn’t want to train. Instead, she will take the beef chunk from me, toss it up in the air and roll around on her back.

Do Nikita and Pavel have favorite enrichment items?

Nikita likes smelly stuff—especially perfumes and spices!

She has three indoor enclosures, one of which has a hammock bed made of firehose. Whenever we spray the hammock with perfume, she will rub her whole body against it to get as much of the scent onto her fur as possible.

In the next enclosure, there is a large log that also serves as enrichment, which we spray with perfume or sprinkle with spices—her favorites being fennel, paprika and sage. On any given day, she will also receive large, heavy-duty boomer balls to stalk, pounce upon or roll around. But, by far, anything scented with perfume is her favorite.

Pavel’s favorite enrichment items are cardboard boxes and bags stuffed with hay shavings—anything he can destroy! The moat is one of Pavel’s preferred places to rest and play, so it stands to reason that toys that float are among his favorites. One such toy is a boomer ball that is tethered to the bench in the moat. He seems to really enjoy wrestling with that and literally making a splash! Another of his favorites is a giant corrugated tube, which he drags into and out of the water. It is a testament to how strong he is. Soaking wet, the tube weighs around 70 pounds!

When Pavel first when out on exhibit, it was 5 degrees below zero and he got into the water in the moat—twice!

Zoo officials say that because Yuri hasn’t sired any cubs yet, his genetics are “particularly valuable to the zoo’s collective efforts to save the species and maintain a healthy, genetically-diverse population of Amur tigers.”

Amur Tigers are considered an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The biggest threats to these tigers come from poaching, both for their fur and their other body parts, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine.

WASHINGTON — The Smithsonian National Zoological Park on March 1 welcomed a new Amur tiger to its ""Great Cats"" exhibit in a conservation effort to increase the population of the critically endangered subspecies.

If all goes well, 6-year-old Nikita will mate with a tiger the zoo already has and produce offspring.

Nikita came from New York's Bronx Zoo as part of a recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program that oversees population management and conservation of select species.

The National Zoo is one of about 200 North American zoos in the AZA membership organization that work together to help struggling animal populations.

Zoos and aquariums cooperatively send and exchange animals through the network when they need to focus on a specific species or are working to expand exhibits.

Amur tigers are considered critically endangered. Illegal poaching to supply black market demand for tiger parts, habitat destruction and trophy hunting have led to a dramatic, more than 95 percent decline in the population of the cats over the last century. Less than 4,000 remain in the wild, according to National Geographic.

The Amur subspecies, one of six tiger subspecies now that three have gone extinct, are normally found in the Russian Far East, northern China and Korean peninsula.

Nikita is expected to breed with Pavel, an 11-year-old Amur male who was brought to the zoo in October 2017 from the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago.

The zoo has another tiger, Damai, who is a Sumatran tiger, but wouldn't breed this subspecies with an Amur tiger in order to ""keep the bloodlines of recognized subspecies pure,"" according to Craig Saffoe, a zoo curator of the ""Great Cats"" exhibit.

Pavel and Nikita currently do not share an enclosure but have ""done their introductions from afar,"" according to a Q & A conducted by the zoo with animal keeper Dell Guglielmo. The two can hear, smell and see each other through a glass partition.

A big concern about the breeding process is whether the two tigers will get along, according to Saffoe.

In the wild, a female tiger gets to pick who she mates with. But in a zoo setting, the decision is already made. Curators are waiting to see if Nikita and Pavel are compatible for breeding, which means there is no time frame for this process.

Nikita needs to first acclimate to her new setting before physical introductions can be made.

Born at the Bronx Zoo, Nikita is now in a completely different place where the smells, the people and location are all new.

""Once she shows us that she is used to the area, then we can introduce her to Pavel,"" Saffoe said. ""If we introduce them at the wrong time, it could lead to fights. And that could lead to injury or death.""

Tiger attraction signs include making friendly ""chuffing"" sounds at the other, rubbing their heads together through a mesh barrier, Nikita rolling on her back, or showing a calm demeanor in the presence of the other tiger.

The last time the zoo bred Amur tigers was 71 years ago. The zoo, under the SSP program, opted to focus on breeding Sumatran tigers, Saffoe said.",National Zoo Hopes To Help Save Endangered Amur Tiger Population,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiENhKNyD6zKlaWxgZCKASFE4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAowiYKBCzCL_PsCMJKq7AU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://patch.com/img/cdn20/users/23121104/20190318/033619/styles/raw/public/processed_images/tiger-pic-1-1552937500-1344.jpg,2019-03-18,"{'sent': 'By Sanchali Singh, Capital News Service\n\nWASHINGTON —', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Sanchali Singh'], 'ORG': ['Capital News Service'], 'GPE': ['WASHINGTON']}}",Tiger
0,"Summers are almost here, and people who enjoy exploring new places have already started writing down and scrapping off various tourists spots in the country. While Goa remains favourite among the millennials, Chambal sanctuary usually finds itself in the “scrapped off” lists.

And mind you, it is not because people are not interested in witnessing the wildlife, but they fear that their trip will come to waste as they won’t be able to see ‘gharials’ – the fish-eating crocodile in the region. Gharials are critically endangered and unique crocodilian species of extraordinary conservation value. Moreover, it is the rarest large animal on the Indian subcontinent. And why are they not showing up more often? Yes, they are endangered, but the decimation of their natural habitat in the process of illegal sand mining on the banks of Chambal river is the primary source of their distress. Apart from Gharials, other wildlife in the region are turtles, crocodiles, and several species of birds such as Flamingos.

Apex Court banned illegal mining 13 years back

Illegal sand minining in the area is not new perhaps. The illegal sand mining in the area dates back to 2003. However, understanding the threat caused by illegal sand mining to the sensitive gharials and other flora and fauna in the region, the Supreme Court banned illegal sand mining. However, it has been almost 13 years after the ban, illegal mining continues to be more rampant in the Gwalior-Chambal area. Over the years, cases of cops failing to bar these activities have surfaced. People operating these illegal mining are called “Sand Mafia”, and over years, they have feared less to the authority. The mafias have not resisted themselves from attacking the forest officials and cops. Many have lost lives in this process. In 2012, an IPS officer was killed while several officials were assaulted.

Mining halt for elections

One tourist who has recently been to the area told The Logical Indian that during his boat ride on the Chambal river, the extent at which the illegal mining was taking place on the river banks appalling. He said, “A large number of tractors along with excavators were lined up on the bank”. Concerned about the breeding season of the Gharials, he further said, “Gharials have low rates of natural breeding, and damage to their eggs due to mining will further lower their breading rate.”

To confirm the ongoing illegal mining, The Logical Indian contacted forest officials of the area. One of the officials under anonymity confirmed that illegal mining has been continuing on both the sides, i.e. Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh sides of the river. However, he said illegal mining activities on both sides have come to a halt due to the upcoming elections.

Well, it is very likely that the mining will restore after the elections are done.

0,"The Milwaukee County Zoo will open its new elephant exhibit May 4, transforming a quarter of the zoo’s current layout and reaffirming its commitment to keep African elephants at the property.

The exhibit includes a 20,000-square-foot ""Elephant Care Center"" with both sand and padded floors and five individual stalls for training and husbandry.

The outdoor space includes hay-filled barrels that zookeepers are able to hang from the ceiling to allow the elephants to exercise their trunk muscles. Elephants in the wild would behave similarly, reaching high into the tree canopies, extending their trunks for branches and leaves to eat, according to zoo officials.

The Milwaukee County Zoo made a commitment in 2013 to keep African elephants in its collection, said Zoo Director Chuck Wikenhauser.

""This first phase of the Adventure Africa project showcases African elephants and the various state-of-the-art amenities and renovations necessary to give these animals the best possible care throughout their lives,"" Wikenhauser said in a written statement.

The current elephant exhibit was one of the first exhibits built when the zoo relocated from Washington Park to Bluemound Road in 1958.

The exhibit has come under fire in recent years for its size and lack of indoor space. In 2015, an online animal rights group called ""The Dodo"" cited The Milwaukee County Zoo as one of the 10 worst zoos for elephants. The zoo’s elephant exhibit was also named in a 2014 In Defense of Animals — another animal rights group — report.

The Milwaukee Zoo’s new exhibit meets the Association of Zoo and Aquariums’ standards for elephant care and can accommodate up to five elephants, according to zoo officials.

The zoo will keep current elephants, Ruth and Brittany, and is looking at options for additional elephants.

The 1.6-acre outdoor space is four times greater in size than the current elephant exhibit. It features a watering hole able to accommodate three fully-submerged elephants, feeding and enrichment walls, shade structures and a self-activating shower.

A demonstration pavilion with shaded visitor seating allows an up-close look at how keepers work with the elephants to offer the highest level of care through daily training and interactions.

""It’s the zoo’s hope that visitors see the overriding goal was to make this entire habitat, both indoor and out, the most normal as possible for elephant behavior in a zoo setting, while also addressing the physical, social and psychological needs of the animals,"" Wikenhauser said in a statement.

The $16.6 million project was paid for by the Zoological Society of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County.

""The renovations were necessary, not only for the elephants, but for the staff’s ability to offer the highest level of care,"" Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele said in a written statement. ""The new exhibit also keeps pace with the quality of animal exhibits at other Midwest zoos.""

Later this year, the zoo will begin construction on a new hippo exhibit. Once complete, visitors will be able to view the hippos in a 60,000-gallon pool. The exhibit will be one of eight in North America with underwater viewing of the animal.

The Zoological Society is currently raising $25 million for the project, which requires special technology to keep the water clear enough for people to see the animals.",Milwaukee County Zoo's New African Elephant Exhibit To Open Next Month,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndwci5vcmcvbWlsd2F1a2VlLWNvdW50eS16b29zLW5ldy1hZnJpY2FuLWVsZXBoYW50LWV4aGliaXQtb3Blbi1uZXh0LW1vbnRo0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.wpr.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/elephants_10-2018-8673_e.jpg?itok=UKMMcpIW,2019-04-08,"{'sent': 'The Milwaukee County Zoo will open its new elephant exhibit May 4, transforming a quarter of the zoo’s current layout and reaffirming its commitment to keep African elephants at the property.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Milwaukee County Zoo'], 'CARDINAL': ['a quarter']}}",Elephant
0,"KARACHI: A survey team assessing population of dolphins in the Indus River reached Tori Bund in Kashmore district on Tuesday.

The five-day survey led by the Sindh Wildlife Department (SWD) is being conducted after a gap of seven years. The last dolphin survey by the wildlife department was conducted in 2011 during which the population of the endemic species was estimated to be 918.

Other members of the team include experts from the irrigation department and a senior zoologist of Shah Abdul Latif University, Khairpur, and a zoology student of Sindh University.

‘We are very much aware of dolphin behaviour, which makes counting easier’

“It’s the first time we have local female zoologists in the survey team, which has a special focus on water quality assessment as there is genuine concern pertaining to growing river pollution,” said Mir Akhtar Hussain Talpur, SWD field officer and the team leader.

Sharing other details of the survey, he said that unlike the 2011 assessment conducted from Guddu to Kotri barrages, this survey would be restricted between Guddu and Sukkur barrages as at present there was no water downstream Kotri.

Asked whether observations from the naked eye are a credible method for dolphin counting, he said: “The area we have chosen is the dolphin hotspot and the method being used is authentic, though old. Besides, we are very much aware of dolphin behaviour, which makes counting easier.”

Elaborating, he said that the species lived in groups and did not move out of an area fast.

Dr Giorgio Pilleri, a Swiss expert who conducted the first Indus river dolphin survey in 1972 and also wrote a famous book (The Secrets of the Blind Dolphins), used the same method.

The team is using a wooden boat so that the river’s marine life is least disturbed.

Dolphin surveys had been a regular feature since the 1970s. Apparently, the population of this species has risen from 132 during the first survey in 1972 to 918, as counted in the last SWD 2011 survey.

Read: Declining dolphin numbers

“The species faces multiple threats, including accidental entanglement in fishing nets, increasing freshwater shortages mainly due to the construction of dams and barrages upstream, shrinking food chain, growing water pollution as well as the use of pesticides to catch fish,” Mr Talpur said.

WWF survey

A 2017 survey conducted by the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P) reported a significant increase in the population of the species since 2001. It covered the dolphin distribution range from Chashma to Sukkur barrages.

It found that the total number of dolphins was 1,816, with 170 dolphins between Chashma and Taunsa barrages, 571 dolphins between Taunsa and Guddu barrages and lastly 1,075 dolphins between Guddu and Sukkur barrages.

The dolphin encounter rate was higher downstream the Indus with the highest population observed between Guddu and Sukkur barrages.

Explore: Is this a farewell for the Indus dolphin?

Locally known as bhulan, the Indus dolphin is the second most endangered freshwater dolphin species in the world, the first being the ‘functionally extinct’ Yangtze river dolphin.

This species is also referred to as the ‘blind dolphin’ as its eyes have not developed lenses. It relies on echolocation to find fish, shrimp, and other prey in the bottom mud.

The government of Sindh designated a 200-kilometre stretch of the Indus between Guddu and Sukkur barrages as the Indus Dolphin Reserve in 1974.

Once found in the Indus and in its major tributaries in Punjab’s Sutlej, Chenab, Ravi and Jhelum rivers, the species is now confined to the main channel of the Indus.

The Guddu-Sukkur river section is today the prime habitat of the freshwater dolphin and contributes the highest number to its total abundance. However, this river section also reports the highest dolphin mortality.

KARACHI: A four-day survey of the Indus River dolphin has revealed a 55 per cent increase in population of the endangered species.

The latest survey carried out by the Sindh Wildlife Department discovered 500 new river dolphins – 1,419 in 2019 – compared to the last recorded census in 2011, which counted as many as 918 dolphins in the 200km-long Indus Dolphin Reserve between Sukkur and Guddu barrage.

The conservation census was a continuation of the last survey conducted seven years ago to keep a population record of the ‘blind dolphin’.

“In the past, surveys were carried out in June and July when the water levels in the Indus River are at its peak, and overflow into the surrounding canals and flood plains,” provincial wildlife conservator Javed Mahar told The Express Tribune. “But this time it was done in April when the water level is reduced and concentrated in certain pockets of the barrages.”

Mahar, who led a team of two boats with 22 members onboard and 58 other participants on land, said the endangered dolphin was found from the Indus delta in the Arabian Sea till Attock in Punjab. “Today we see that no river water reaches downstream of the Kotli barrage… dolphin population is now surviving only in fragmented pockets such as the protected area of Indus Dolphin Reserve,” he said.

The first ever dolphin census in the country was carried out in 1974 by Swiss professor Giorgio Pilleri, which discovered only 150 dolphins. Following his survey, the first-ever protected area designated only for the conservation of endangered dolphins was created to save them from extinction.

There used to be four freshwater river dolphin species in the world and only three remain in existence now, according to Mahar. “China has already lost their species (Yangtze river dolphin), there is one that dwells in Amazon river, Brazil (Amazon river dolphin). Besides the Ganges dolphin living in India, the Indus River dolphin is endemic to Pakistan, (i.e. it’s not found anywhere else in the world),” he said.

Mahar also shared the discovery of the Smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata) as footprints and droppings of the endangered species were observed in the protected area. It was previously rumoured to have disappeared.

The survey also included two women zoologists as part of the team in a previously all-male expedition: Dr Zaibun Nisa Memon, and Komal Arif Hingoro.

Memon is a professor of Zoology at Khairpur University whereas Hingoro is an M Phil scholar and student of zoology at the Sindh University.

“It was a good experience for me… for the first time I was able to live in the habitat of dolphins and see them live,” she told The Express Tribune. “From dawn till dusk I was able to see and count dolphins, especially in the scorching heat. I urge more girls to come out and be allowed by their families to take part in field research.”

0,"The iconic “death roll” of alligators and crocodiles may be more common among species than previously believed, according to a new study published in Ethology, Ecology & Evolution and coauthored by a researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Contrary to popular belief, crocodiles can’t chew, so they use a powerful bite coupled with a full-bodied twisting motion—a death roll—to disable, kill, and dismember prey into smaller pieces. The lethal movement is characteristic of both alligators and crocodiles and has been featured in numerous movies and nature documentaries.

Until now, the death roll had only been documented in a few of the 25 living crocodilian species, but how many actually do it?

“We conducted tests in all 25 species, and 24 of them exhibited the behavior,” said lead author Stephanie Drumheller-Horton, a paleontology professor in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at UT.

Science Minute: Crocodiles and Their Infamous Death Roll

For the research, Drumheller-Horton teamed up with Kent Vliet from the University of Florida and Jim Darlington, curator of reptiles at the St. Augustine Alligator Farm.

It was previously believed that slender-snouted species, like the Indian gharial, didn’t roll because their diets consist of small prey like fish, eaten whole.

But it turns out that feeding isn’t the only time the animals might roll.

“Aggression between individual crocodylians can become quite intense, often involving bites and death rolls in establishing dominance or competition for females,” Vliet said.

Paleosuchus palpebrosus, commonly called Cuvier’s dwarf caiman, is the only species that did not perform a death roll under experimental conditions. “Although, it’s also possible that they were just being uncooperative,” said Darlington.

And the fossil ancestors of modern crocodiles? If they share a similar body plan and lifestyle with their modern counterparts, it’s likely that they could death roll, too.

“Crocodile relatives have played the role of semi-aquatic ambush predator since the Age of Dinosaurs,” said Drumheller-Horton.

Whether in the Northern Territories of Australia, a lake in the Serengeti, or a watering hole in the late Cretaceous, chances are that a patient predator is waiting in the water to surprise its next meal with a burst of speed, a powerful bite, and a spinning finish.

0,"Gharials and mugger crocodiles are found living in overlapping habitats. But until now not much was known about how they partition resources during basking and nesting.

Researchers found that gharials preferred basking on mid-river islands and on gentler slopes and lower heights, compared with the basking sites of muggers.

For nesting, gharials selected nest sites closer to the water whereas muggers chose sites farther away from the water.

When one species encounters another, also occupying the same habitat, splitting up the resources available can help avoid competition. This is the strategy adopted by gharials and mugger crocodiles in Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in northern India, according to a study by researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India, which finds that both species have different preferences for basking and nesting sites.

Classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), gharials (Gavialis gangeticus) are long crocodiles native to northern India and are distinguished by their long, narrow snouts. In contrast, the broad-snouted mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), also known as marsh crocodiles, are vulnerable and have a wider distribution extending into Pakistan and southern Iran.

Both species have overlapping habitats in the northern rivers (Ganges, Chambal, Son, Ramganga and Girwa) and eastern (Mahanadi) river systems of India and historically have shown systematic resource partitioning in their aquatic environments, said B.C. Choudhury, co-author of the study and retired professor from the Endangered Species Management Department at the Wildlife Institute of India.

“The gharial is predominantly a fish-eater but mugger is very catholic in its dietary choice (having a diverse and broad diet). In their natural riverine habitats, the gharial numbers were higher than mugger,” he said.

Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS) is situated in northern Uttar Pradesh close to the Nepal border, where populations of both species were enhanced by the reintroduction of captive-reared stocks, said Choudhury, who is also a member of the IUCN-SSC Crocodile Specialist Group and its regional (Asia) co-chair.





Location of Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary on the Indo-Nepal border.

“In the first few years, the reintroduction was only of gharial. But while the wild-laid gharial eggs were collected for artificial hatchery incubation, mistakenly, mugger eggs were also collected and hatched in captivity and after rearing they too were released into the protected area,” explained Choudhury. “Being hardy and adaptive, the mugger population increased faster compared to the gharial and this mugger reintroduction has been a cause of concern. This mugger release has been happening since mid-1980s.”

But until now, little is known about how these two crocodilian species partition resources in terms of basking and nesting. To find out, B.C. Choudhury along with Shikha Choudhary and Govindhan Veeraswami Gopi surveyed gharials and muggers from December to April 2011 along a 14-km stretch of the Girwa River that originates from Nepal and flows in the north-west of KWS. They identified where both species bask and nest focusing on variables that affected their preferences for these sites such as slope, height, soil moisture, among others.

Different site preferences for nesting and seasonal basking

The researchers found that during winter and summer, gharials preferred to bask on mid-river sand islands known as sandbars and on gentle slopes, at a lower platform height whereas muggers basked mainly on river banks choosing steeper slopes and elevated platforms. This is likely because gharials have weaker legs, the team said. “Unlike muggers who can walk high, gharials can only crawl,” said Shikha Choudhary, lead author of the study, which was her Master’s dissertation at the Wildlife Institute of India.

Gharials picked basking sites with higher soil moisture than muggers. “Gharials being of lighter colouration need more heat to warm their bodies,” explained Choudhary, and “sandbars, or sand and silt” have “far more moisture than other surfaces” providing “a combination of hot (sunny) and cool (from moisture in the sand) environment, reducing the chance of desiccation while basking.” It is also easier to descend back into the water from sandbars. Muggers, on the other hand, were not restricted to sandy surfaces and were found basking on a variety of substrates such as silt, clay and fallen logs.

When it came to selecting nesting sites, gharials and muggers had very different choices. While both species lay eggs in the dry season, gharials picked sandy soils that were closer to the water with steeper slopes and higher height, whereas muggers chose sites farther away from the water with gentler slopes and a lower height.

A possible explanation for gharials nesting closer to the water may be because unlike other crocodile species in which parents help their hatchlings emerge from the nest and carry them to the water, gharial hatchlings have to reach the water by themselves, said Choudhary, who is currently pursuing her Ph.D. at Amity University. “Since nests are very close to the water, gharials prefer steeper sandbanks mainly to protect their nest from the fluctuating water levels of the river.” Also, by placing nests higher and on sandbars, gharials are able to avoid predation, added B.C. Choudhury.

Gharials more vulnerable, muggers thriving

This study seems to suggest that “gharials are specialists in selecting basking and nesting sites, while muggers are generalists,” said Choudhary, adding that “because of this, gharials are more vulnerable to any changes in habitat.”

To reduce competition between the two crocodilian species, the researchers suggest that conservation efforts should pay attention to gharials in north Indian rivers while in peninsular rivers, muggers should be the focus.

Choudhary warned that “de-siltation of the river or deepening of the river” could lead to the elimination of mid-river islands” or affect the course of the river, which can, in turn, have an impact on gharial nesting sites.

“This is an interesting study that separates habitat requirements of gharial and mugger in the same habitat,” said Lala A.K. Singh, former officer-in-charge of the Government of India CCBMTI (Central Crocodile Breeding and Management Training Institute), who was not involved in the study. “They have quantified it to a certain extent,” he said, adding that “this will guide the managers and researchers” when incorporated with his past findings. In a 1991 report from the Mahanadi, he observed that “with disturbance, gharial, may desert a place but mugger may thrive and ‘prosper’.”

Additionally, Singh pointed out a recent concerning trend he has observed: mugger populations are increasing in some gharial habitats. In a 2015 study he co-authored with Rishikesh K. Sharma from the National Chambal Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary, which houses the country’s largest population of gharials, Singh noted that over a period of 30 years from 1984, mugger sightings have shot up “more than 10 times from 33 and their spatial distribution has expanded to the entire river.” But during the same time period, “sighting of gharial has increased less than two-fold from 605,” he revealed.

“Gharials have specific habitat requirements; so they do not leave perennial river habitats,” explained Singh. “In the long past, mugger could have taken over some habitats completely—in south / central India (Narmada river, is one example); Mahanadi is the recent example.

0,"This discovery explains some puzzling parts of panda biology. The panda’s ancestors switched to a vegetarian diet more than 2 million years ago. In that time, the panda has evolved stronger jaws for chewing tough, fibrous mouthfuls, and one of its wristbones has become a false thumb, for gripping bamboo stems. But despite these superficial hardware changes, it still has a meat eater’s digestive system.

Plant-eating mammals almost always have enlarged, elongated guts to slow the passage of food, and to give their inner bacteria more time to digest their meals. The panda, however, has the short, vanilla gut of a carnivore. Even its gut microbes are closer to a bear’s than, say, a cow’s or deer’s. Nie and Wei’s study makes sense of this paradoxical combination of traits. The giant panda has the plumbing of a half-committed herbivore because it has the diet of a closet carnivore.

Read: Pandas bounce back in spite of their critics

The team used tracking collars to follow pandas in China’s Foping National Nature Reserve, which harbors the highest density of these bears in the world. The pandas, it turned out, migrate over long distances to exploit the shoots and leaves of two bamboo species, which grow at different altitudes. Every year, the bears cycle from low-growing leaves, to low-growing shoots, to high-growing shoots, to high-growing leaves, and back again. The team analyzed these varied mouthfuls and determined that the pandas’ decisions seem largely motivated by protein. They’re always selecting the species and tissues that offer the most protein and the least fiber.

Their selective tastes mean that at least 50 percent of their energy comes from protein, while just 39 percent comes from carbohydrates, and 13 percent from fat. That’s comparable to feral cats and wolves, which also get half their energy from protein. And it’s starkly different from other plant-eating mammals, which typically get 20 percent of their energy from protein.

Panda poop, which the team also collected and analyzed, told the same story. So did panda milk. Nutritionally, it stands apart from most herbivore milk, and falls in with typical carnivore milk.

This suggests that the move from meat to plants might have been easier for ancestral pandas than commonly assumed. By simply choosing parts of plants that are richer in protein, they could switch to vegetarianism without needing to radically overhaul their bodies. “If you’re going to switch to a specific plant, bamboo isn’t too bad, as it does have respectable plant protein levels, as well as a swath of different vitamins,” says Garret Suen of the University of Wisconsin at Madison.

0,"The huge earthquake that rocked China’s Sichuan Province 11 years ago this month was a catastrophic human tragedy. But it also drew attention to the vulnerability of the country’s giant pandas.

The magnitude 8.0 temblor destroyed large swaths of panda habitat, as well as parts of the Wolong Panda Center, a key breeding facility for the vulnerable species. Several pandas died.

Now, all eyes are back on these iconic animals as the Chinese government creates a supersize national park in their name.

The proposed Giant Panda National Park—whose final plan will likely be finalized in fall 2019—spans 10,476 square miles, nearly triple the area of Yellowstone. (Check out three places to see giant pandas in the wild.)

Most of the land will be in Sichuan Province, home to more than 80 percent of wild pandas. The majority of it is not “new”—it brings together dozens of established panda reserves and other protected areas containing thousands of plant and animal species, many of them threatened or endangered.

The park is the latest bit of good news for the panda: The most recent census, released in 2015, estimated a total wild population of 1,864 bears (not including cubs), up from a low of around 1,200 in the 1980s.

Whether the higher number is due to better counting methods or true growth is unknown, but in 2016 the International Union for Conservation of Nature went so far as to downgrade the giant panda from “endangered” to “vulnerable.”

But the large mammal is still confined to six mountain ranges and split into about 30 groups across western China. Logging, road construction, agriculture, and other human encroachment—plus natural disasters—have degraded the landscape and broken up populations. (Read about efforts to reintroduce pandas into the wild.)

The new refuge aims to connect fragmented panda habitat and, by doing so, link up bear populations, some of which have fewer than a dozen individuals.

It “takes the long view,” says Bob Tansey, China policy advisor for The Nature Conservancy. “Generally, pandas are doing well. But what will they need in the future? Connectivity.”

Making connections

Theoretically, the park’s melding together of wild landscapes will improve pandas’ ability to find mates and boost their genetic diversity.

It will also give them room to roam as climate change shifts where bamboo—their main food—can grow.

To panda expert Marc Brody, designating the national park is a vital step, but it “does not directly resolve habitat fragmentation.”

The new park has promise on paper, he says, “but habitat will remain patchy until degraded lands are restored and stronger land-use restrictions get enforced that make wildlife corridors possible.”

Giant Pandas 101 Giant pandas' habitat in the wild today is limited to the mountains of China, but their appetite remains unlimited. They spend nearly every waking moment eating bamboo. Learn about giant pandas and how their diet shapes their lives.

If such corridors become reality, “that will be the exciting legacy of this park,” says Brody, a National Geographic Explorer and founder of Panda Mountain, an ecotourism and conservation organization.

Under new management

The need for connectivity applies to the administration of the park as well, which is why, under the new park name, the Chinese government is working to streamline oversight and management of panda conservation areas.

In fall 2018, officials established a national administrative bureau to act as the heart of park management; provincial and local reorganizations are set to follow.

The master plan will lay out the government’s steps toward more effective conservation, such as consolidation. Previously, protected areas fell into a dozen categories, while numerous government entities managed the lands with no single vision, according to Luo Peng, of the Chengdu Institute of Biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an author of the plan.

“Local governments, which have local-development priorities, sometimes had too much say over the natural [areas],” he said in an email. “Coordination was not always effective.” (Learn about the dramatic measures taken to get pandas to mate.)

Now, management of the park will be centralized under the new National Forestry and Grassland Administration, and protected-area designations will be consolidated into fewer categories.

This new structure could smooth the rough edges, making potential conflicts between conservation, development interests, and citizens easier to address, Peng says.

It should also help support local governments tasked with upholding the rules; critics have long held that China’s protected areas suffer from weak enforcement.

Prioritizing people

According to Luo Peng, the park will be set up around core protected areas that prohibit farming, grazing, mining, logging, tourism, or other development. (Read why it’s so difficult to photograph pandas.)

Fewer restrictions will apply to “general control zones,” which will allow tourism and some farming and other local activities—but only after “rigorous evaluation for environmental impacts,” he says.

But Brody notes some proposals for tourism development, such as a railway through the Wolong Nature Reserve, “may only compound conservation and resource management challenges.”

For each new large-scale tourism initiative, experts “need to examine if it provides a direct benefit to improving habitat for wild pandas,” and if it brings real benefits to local communities, says Brody.

Historically, local people have not often benefited from tourism, and by some calculations, as many as 170,000 people live within or near the new park boundaries, according to the Associated Press.

And while a person’s decision to move appears to be voluntary so far, the Chinese government has a long history of relocating citizens for conservation or development projects.

Jianguo “Jack” Liu of Michigan State University—whose research on the human impact on panda habitat is helping inform park planners—says the government is providing financial incentives, like paid college tuition, to people living in affected regions as a way to encourage “natural relocation.”

The approach “has [already] been very successful,” with many youths leaving rural areas for college, technical training, or jobs in cities, he says.

For those who don’t want to go, however, “it is critical that villagers get the opportunity to stay on their ancestral lands,” says Brody.

He suggests the government could train and employ those citizens to restore degraded panda habitat, replacing exotic-tree plantations with native flora, for example.

A time for national parks

China already has hundreds thousands of protected areas covering about 18 percent of its land surface, but critics say many have lacked proper planning at inception and fail to truly protect biodiversity.

That’s why the panda park is one piece of a broader effort to create a national park system in China, modeled in part on the U.S. national parks system.

After President Xi Jinping announced such intentions in December 2013, Chinese delegations visited Yellowstone, Yosemite, and other U.S. parks to kick start their own planning, says Rose Niu, chief conservation officer of the Paulson Institute, a think-tank dedicated to U.S.-China relations that hosted the U.S. park visits.

Now, eleven new parks (including the panda park) are in their pilot phase, and as many as a hundred others, plus a dozen marine and coastal protected areas, are in consideration, according to Niu.

“There’s greater prosperity in China now, and there’s a natural progression toward conservation,” says TNC’s Tansey. “A park system’s time has come.” (See beautiful photos of all 61 U.S. national parks.)

Niu agrees, noting Chinese policy has shifted in that “local governments still may prioritize economic growth, but higher up, conservation is winning over development.”

And the guiding principle, she says, “is to engage with local communities and let them benefit from the changing conservation landscape.”

Now comes the real test of whether the government’s newest aspirations become effective actions, Brody adds.",China’s new panda park will be three times bigger than Yellowstone,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEGSiysJWS5vHHF6mymIKFC4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAowmrWECzDc_IADMP7SgwY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2019/05/pandas-china/01-pandas-china-nationalgeographic_2496772.ngsversion.1557484205261.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2019-05-10,"{'sent': 'The huge earthquake that rocked China’s Sichuan Province 11 years ago this month was a catastrophic human tragedy.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China', 'Sichuan Province']}}",Giant White Panda
0,"Conventionally, water quality is measured by collecting grab samples and testing them in laboratories.

By Priyank Hirani & Vikas Dimble

It’s not just India’s air that’s choking; the water is getting toxic as well. It is estimated that about 70% of surface water is unfit for consumption. The most marginalised drink and use this water for their daily needs. In fact, every day, almost 40 billion litres of wastewater enters rivers and other water bodies, with only a tiny fraction being adequately treated.

A recent World Bank report estimates annual costs associated with water pollution, sanitation and hygiene at about `470-610 billion per year—most of which comes from the cost of diarrhoeal mortality and morbidity of children under five, and other population morbidity. In terms of ecological impact, India’s national aquatic animal, the Ganges River Dolphin, has become an endangered species due to pollution. Despite its severe implications, there is no comprehensive programme for monitoring river water quality in real time.

Changing the game

Conventionally, water quality is measured by collecting grab samples and testing them in laboratories. Even though this may be a robust method, it has limitations: obtaining results takes time, it is expensive on a per sample basis, and also prone to human errors at various stages. On the other hand, sensors that can monitor water pollution in real time can furnish quick and reliable data for policymakers to act upon. Such sensors, when taken around on boats instead of fixing them to specific locations, can provide a comprehensive picture of the health of a river by gathering multiple data points in a given area rather than relying on a single-point measurement.

Rivers are dynamic ecosystems. They require continuous monitoring and near real-time data availability to ensure effective and holistic decision-making. But that’s not necessarily the common practice in India. For instance, the distance between two consecutive stations—one near Raebareli and the other near Allahabad—being currently monitored on River Ganga by government agencies on a monthly basis, is about 80 km. Owing to lack of data in this 80-km stretch between the two stations, one may lose out on information about any contaminants entering the river through industrial waste, municipal sewerage or agricultural field discharges in between these two stations. They add to the total pollution load in the river, but can go unnoticed since their effects could die down by the time the river reaches Allahabad.

Today, there are initiatives that use sensor technology to map river pollution hotspots in similar stretches in India to present policymakers with evidence to design interventions. To gather data, boats, with automated sensors attached to them, are taken around sites of interest on a regular basis. By pinpointing sources of pollution, identifying safe bathing ghats and quantifying pollution load entering the river, this approach can help regulatory bodies and other stakeholders.

Disseminating data

While collecting reliable and accurate data is essential, disclosing data to public in easy-to-understand formats is necessary to enable end-users to act upon it. Geotagging all data points helps in superimposing data on technical water parameters data on, say, Google Maps. Further, colour coding the scale for these data points helps create heat maps that can pinpoint any pollution sources entering the river. Such visualisations can equip citizens with information to influence policymakers and play a crucial role in monitoring their local environment through community-led initiatives.

Helping public policy

Lack of high-quality data has been an obstacle for effective regulation of water pollution in India. Due to staffing constraints, manual inspections, which can often be manipulated, are carried out only a few times a year and that too only in a few places. Real-time monitoring of long stretches of water bodies can make reliable and accurate data available to regulators, and disclosing the data to public in real time have the potential to vastly improve regulation and enforcement. Existing research shows that disclosing data to public has many additional advantages. Such disclosures create competition among industries on environmental performance. In fact, civil society groups, common people and investors nudge polluters towards acting responsibly.

Cleaning India’s rivers has been a political promise for long. To make it a reality, it’s time to raise the game with better water quality data and transparency measures.

0,"Wildly Successful: Lessons from The Amur Tiger: Be Tenacious

Introducing Jim Knox, our newest columnist

Measuring up to twelve feet from nose to tail, standing five feet tall on all fours, tipping the scales at up to seven hundred pounds and boasting three-inch long canines, Amur Tigers are as humbling as they are magnificent. I’m grateful to have a firsthand perspective on these apex predators. I have prepared their meals, fed them, cleaned their quarters, observed their behaviors, and assisted veterinary teams with their handling and surgical procedures, including root canals—yes, even tigers get cavities!

Possessing the advantage—the privilege—of providing care for tigers, has given me a fathomless reverence for these primal creatures. It has given voice, texture, and force to their extraordinary adaptations. Their two-inch arched claws shred oak and maple logs. Their dense outer fur shields them from prolonged sub-zero temperatures. Their crowned carnassial teeth easily shear through lamb shanks—bone and all!

The tiger is a creature of contradiction. It is designed to kill large prey almost instantly with unstoppable force. Amur tigers are masterful predators and superbly designed killers, capable of dealing a swift death to any creature within their domain. This is an apex predator with few equals, and yet… it is a failure.

With a kill rate hovering at a meager five percent, tigers survive not solely because of their incredible physical adaptations, but also their enviable behavioral adaptations. Through my work, I’ve come to realize that the tiger in, its entirety, is a creature greater than just its scientific self. It’s greatness extends far beyond its jaws and claws.

Their physical adaptations provide a platform for success in stalking and killing their prey such as Red Deer and Wild Boar, it is the behavioral “inner tiger” which wields the true power. In a word, it is the tiger’s tenacity that gets the job done. Stoked by hunger and fueled by failure, this tenacity pushes the tiger to its absolute physical limits to persevere, hunt after failed hunt, until it scores a life-saving kill.

The tiger requires large hoofed prey, up to one hundred pounds of meat, to refuel and repair a body ravaged by the rigors of the hunt at forty below zero. Between these large successes, the great cats subsist on hares, birds, rodents and carrion to keep them going as a bridge between their large meals.

In the human world, not every achievement is monumental, but the path to every monumental achievement is marked by more modest achievements, which enable us to reach our goals.

Expanding one’s own territory or establishing an entirely new home range is a bold move, yet tigers perch with seeming ease atop this knife edge of risk and reward. Dismissing the human element of poaching, tigers must still contend with, among harsh and potentially fatal factors, other tigers. Like house cats and dogs, tigers scent mark territorial boundaries to maintain dominion over the food, water, space and shelter resources within their home range.

They will spray hormone-laced blasts of urine to mark any prominent vertical natural landmark such a boulder, tree or rock face. This is a tiger’s equivalent of an olfactory neon flashing sign which reads: “Keep Out! Enter at Your Own Risk!”

With each cat possessing the strength of 17 full-grown humans, they mean it. Trespassing encroachment on guarded territory and resources can be met with lethal force. If the victor is hungry, the loser may be eaten.

The Amur tiger possesses certain undeniable strengths, and so do we. Specifically, the Amur tiger is equipped with phenomenal raw physical power—the kind of power which enables it to square off against full-grown Eurasian Brown bears. The tiger, capable of covering 50 feet per second, is an explosive ambush predator, which takes the majority of its prey within the first 150 feet of its attack. Its main prey, Red Deer and Wild Boar, are equally fast and can sustain their speed far longer than 150 feet. Such quarry are no pushovers. The Eurasian Wild Boar is a fearsome creature. With a low center of gravity mounted on a seven foot-long, five hundred and fifty-pound frame, it is nature’s bulldozer. Reaching 0-30 mile per hour acceleration in under 1.5 seconds, this bulldozer runs on nitrous oxide. Throw in exceptional hearing, paired five-inch, self-sharpening razor tusks and arguably the planet’s most refined sense of smell, and you’ve got one formidable adversary.

The tiger has its work cut out for it. It must stealthily stalk or secret itself within striking distance to put its strength into play. It has to put itself into a position to unleash its strength or the hunt is over before it begins. We can do the same, giving ourselves the opportunity to wield the advantages we possess.

By concentrating its strengths well and employing them in concert, the tiger gains an incremental advantage, which is sorely needed if the cat is to survive and prevail against capable prey. A tiger gains knowledge from the harsh lessons failure instills. A missed leap or a goring at the business end of a Wild Boar provide powerful incentives to incorporate alternate tactics.

Another core strength the tiger harnesses in its pursuit of success is focus. I’m not talking mere concentration here. I’m talking about intense, unwavering focus—the kind of focus which excludes all non-essential factors. The tiger is single-minded in pursuit of its quarry. While failure is no stranger to this predator, it endures. With every stealthy placement of its leathery foot pads, the Amur tiger is relentlessly hunting success every bit as much as it is hunting Red Deer and Wild Boar.

The great cat prepares for the moment it puts its skills to the test. Readying every sense, it targets its prey, locking its gaze and fixating on its objective. Time becomes suspended and then, it happens. In an instant, all of its energy—every sense, strength and skill coalesce in a potent, fluid burst of energy which launches the tiger to victory.

We all face challenges to achievement and the stakes get higher: passing the Bar exam, landing your first job, publishing your manuscript… the list goes on. By applying behavioral biomimicry—emulating animals as models of success, we can achieve remarkable things. Each one of us has at least one Wild Boar in our sights. With the right game plan we can bring down this daunting quarry. We need look no further than our friend the Amur Tiger to coax it out. To the tiger, failure is not defining. Nurturing the tenacity to succeed five percent of the time after having failed ninety five percent of the time…now that’s defining!

0,"African elephants are threatened with extinction. With numbers shrinking by a third in just seven years, there are now fewer than 350,000 left in the wild. And their dwindling numbers are not just the concern of nature documentaries – they play vital roles in helping plant life prosper, digging water holes and improving foraging conditions for other animals.

In 2011, poaching rates hit an all-time high, with 10% of all elephants on the continent killed in a single year. Thankfully, our new research, published in Nature Communications, reveals that the poaching rate has since declined, hovering at around 4% in 2017.

However, this drop is not enough – at current levels of poaching, the African elephant could still become near extinct in a few decades. This is despite substantial law enforcement efforts, and legislation to outlaw the trade of ivory. Our results suggest that if we are to save the African elephant, we should begin to direct resources towards less traditional approaches.

Slow economy, lower poaching

The drop in poaching from 2011 levels was likely due to a decrease in demand for ivory in China and South-East Asia – but the reasons for this decrease are not obvious. It would be easy to assume that China’s ivory trade ban and prominent supportive campaigns led by celebrities were responsible, but the dates don’t match up – the trade ban wasn’t announced until 2015 and didn’t take effect until 2017.

The ban may have had some positive effect on more recent poaching numbers, and it certainly sends the right political messages. But as demonstrated by the recent growth in rhino poaching despite a comprehensive ban, history tells us that making a coveted animal product illegal doesn’t always curb trade.

Read more: Why China's ivory ban is a mammoth step towards saving the elephant

Instead, it seems that China’s slowing economy may have been the main driver behind the fall in poaching. And while the subsequent economic squeeze probably reduced ivory demand among the rich in Asia, poaching could easily rise again should China’s economy change.

A new approach

The most important thing we can do to reduce poaching is to stop people setting out to poach in the first place. Traditionally, law enforcement has been seen as the cornerstone of strategies to cut supply, driving a push for increasingly militarised anti-poaching operations. But while law enforcement did explain some of the large variation in poaching rates across sites, a much bigger correlate of poaching rates was the level of poverty and corruption in the area.

For many involved in poaching in Africa, the ivory from a single large elephant could be sold for much more than they have any chance of earning in an entire year. And given that elephants regularly raid crops and kill community members, even those not involved are often understandably ambivalent about tackling poaching.

That’s not to say that we should stop investing in law enforcement. The mere presence of a few rangers deters many poachers, and is an extremely useful strategy. But the most professional poachers will only be deterred by a large, well-trained, and well-equipped field team, which simply isn’t practical in sites that cover ground areas in excess of small European countries. Our results suggest that some of the vast sum of money spent on these types of operations may be better spent on poverty and corruption-related interventions.

Of course, reducing poverty and corruption is no simple task either. Some conservation organisations have tried offering financial incentives to communities for taking an active role in conservation efforts, but these schemes have had mixed results as cash benefits are often small, or not shared equally.

Our results suggest that conservation benefits may result from any reduction in poverty, not just from development schemes that are directly tied to biodiversity. So conservation organisations might seek to invest in, say, the provision of factories that offer appropriate employment to community members, or make grants to community members for new business ideas.

The important bonus of this approach is that in addition to being an effective method of reducing poaching, it would place improving the lives of thousands of Africans as a central priority. The well-being of humans and wildlife are not isolated issues. The plight of all species on this planet are intertwined, and the sooner we act accordingly, the better.","To save the African elephant, focus must turn to poverty and corruption",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEKaM-YXRbPawl9w5ZJMkxiEqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow2cb3CjCTjNcCMLLArQY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images.theconversation.com/files/276816/original/file-20190528-42565-19e5tz1.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=43%2C0%2C4800%2C2400&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2019-05-28,"{'sent': 'With numbers shrinking by a third in just seven years, there are now fewer than 350,000 left in the wild.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['fewer than 350,000']}}",Elephant
0,"The outcry over the restoration of elephant hunting in Botswana is far from over. Animal welfare NGOs seem to have been in constant action since the announcement made on May 22, 2019 by the government of Botswana, a southern African country.

“Our responsibility to protect the environment has not changed, but we have an obligation to citizens,” said Kitso Mokaila, Botswana’s Minister of the Environment. The Ministry promises a resumption of orderly and ethical hunting. Four hundred elephants will be captured each year in a controlled manner.

More than 130,000 elephants live in Botswana, about one third of the species in Africa. Five years ago, the country banned their sport hunting under the aegis of President Ian Khama. Last year, however, his successor, Mokgweetsi Masisi, set up a committee to determine whether the ban on trophy hunting could be lifted. An approach that the current government justifies by the difficult coexistence between humans and elephants, which has become even more complex. Due to the droughts of recent years, animals have spread across the country in search of water sources. These animals, weighing more than 5 tonnes, thus coming into contact with farmers more often, pose a threat to their lives, destroy their crops and ravage their properties.

Animal advocates fear a resurgence of poaching and ivory trafficking

Many animal welfare organisations were outraged by the lifting of Botswana’s elephant-hunting ban. It is “scandalous”, denounced Humane Society International, an NGO based in London. Botswana’s elephant population is “vital for the regional survival of this iconic species,” according to the NGO. “Resuming elephant hunting raises moral questions and runs counter to all international efforts to protect these mammals, not to mention the risk of damaging the valuable tourism industry, one of Botswana’s main resources,” Humane Society International added.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), although the number of pachyderms has increased in some African regions, it has decreased by 111,000 worldwide in a decade, mainly due to ivory trafficking.

In this debate, however, some organisations temper and reconcile the two opposing theses. This is the case with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Lifting the moratorium can be advantageous, as long as it is very well supervised. “In some strictly controlled cases, particularly of endangered species, scientific evidence shows that hunting can be an effective means of wildlife conservation,” the NGO said.

The same debates are being held elsewhere in the world about large mammals. In France, samples taken from wolf populations, claimed by shepherds, are thus rejected by environmental associations because the issue of protecting large mammals is linked to the protection of their habitat. Protecting these large animals means protecting their entire ecosystem and the species associated with them that form a long-food chain. Just as protecting ecosystems means protecting resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions

0,"High-profile changes in the political environment seem to be reducing the overall number of illegally killed elephants in Africa seems to be falling, according to the authors of a new paper published on 28 May in Nature Communications (1). But there is still much to be done to protect the remaining elephant populations.

Elephant poaching rates reached a peak in 2011 but have since declined, mainly due to anti-poaching policies and increased law enforcement. For example, China’s recent ban on ivory trade is considered a major success. Nonetheless, 10-15,000 elephants are still killed each year by poachers. And sadly, there are currently only around 350,000 elephants left in Africa.

At current poaching rates, Loxodonta africana (the African elephant) is in danger of being almost wiped from the African continent. Elephant poaching is now high up the international agenda. To this end, further research can help guide poaching policies.

The international team of researchers from the University of Freiburg in Germany, the University of York in the UK, and the United Nations’ Convention for the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) enlisted the help of so-called hierarchical regression models to explore the possible contribution of relevant drivers to reduce poaching. The authors hoped to find out which interventions could have the biggest impact. In the paper, they state two main aims:

1) to test whether local conditions in different sites and in different years can explain variation in poaching rates between and within elephant populations;

2) to identify the processes to which poaching rates are most sensitive, thereby identifying priority targets for conservation.

Using the models, they examined the correlation between the number of elephant carcases found between 2002 and 2017 — based on 53 African Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) sites — to several socioeconomic variables on a local, regional, and global level.

The researchers found that annual poaching mortality rate declined from an estimated peak of over 10 per cent in 2011 to less than 4 per cent in 2017. But to achieve long-term success, governments must implement comprehensive social and behavioural change interventions.

The findings suggest two important targets: the first is to reduce demand in Asia and the second, to improve the livelihoods of people in Africa. In particular, they note that poaching rates primarily correlate to ivory prices in South East Asia. Therefore, any hope for success will require tackling demand in that region

While improving anti-poaching law enforcement is important, it will not completely solve the poaching problem. Elephant populations will continue to decline if governments do not take action to tackle poverty, reduce corruption, and decrease the demand for ivory.

African elephants are the largest mammals on Earth and play a vital role in savannahs and forest ecosystems, and attract much-needed eco-tourism to the continent. However, ensuring their future “will require stronger laws and enforcement efforts and genuine community engagement”, says Lisa Rolls Hagelberg, Head of Wildlife Communication & Ambassador Relations, UN Environment.

WWF-India has been working towards the conservation of the Harike Wetland since 2007 in partnership with the Department of Forests and Wildlife Preservation, Government of Punjab. In 2007, a survey was conducted in certain stretches of River Beas which established the presence of the Indus River Dolphin in the Beas. The first survey of Indus River Dolphin in the Beas Conservation Reserve (185kms was jointly conducted in May 2018.

0,"Bhubaneswar: Concerned over the alarming fall in the number of gharials (fish-eating crocodiles) in Satkosia gorge, the 21-km narrow stretch of River Mahanadi near Tikarpada, about 60 km from Angul district, the authorities of Satkosia Wildlife Division and Nandanakan Zoo have prepared a blueprint to increase their population.

Jayant Das, the deputy director of Nandankanan Zoo, informed that about 30 sub-adult gharials will be released in Satkosia gorge in a phased manner. “As the number of gharials at Nandankanan has gone up more than its capacity, the zoo authorities have stopped their artificial incubation since 2015. Looking at their excess numbers at the zoo, the forest department has decided to release them in Satkosia gorge, which is an ideal habitat for them, to increase their population,” he added.

At present, there is only one old gharial left in Satkosia gorge.

Das further said that some young gharials from Nandankanan were released in Satkosia gorge in the recent past. But their numbers did not grow because there was no breeding.

The zoo official blamed the dwindling gharial population in Satkosia gorge on increasing human activities in the river and the consequent reduction in habitable stretches for the gharials. Besides, the survival rate of crocodile hatchlings in nature is very low due to predators.

Notably, the three species of crocodiles (gharial, mugger and saltwater crocodile) in the river systems of Odisha have been on the verge of extinction since the 1970s.



Consequently, piecemeal efforts were made to save these crocodile species. Dr HR Bustard, an expert of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) engaged by UNDP/FAO and the Indian government, studied the prospects of crocodile rehabilitation. On the basis of his report and recommendations, a Crocodile Conservation Project was launched in 1975 in different states.

The gharial and saltwater crocodile conservation programme was first implemented in Odisha in early 1975. Subsequently, the mugger conservation programme was initiated in the state. The funds and technical support for the projects came from UNDP/ FAO through the Central government.

At present, gharial and saltwater crocodile breeding centres are functioning at Tikarpada in Angul district and Dangamal in Bhitarkanika National Park in Kendrapara district.

One of the longest of all living crocodiles, the male gharial has a body length of up to 6 metres (20 ft). With 110 sharp, interdigitated teeth in its long, thin snout, the gharial is well adapted to catching fish, its main diet. The tail is well-developed and laterally flattened. Together with webbed feet, it provides tremendous manoeuvrability in deep water.

A study on the fossils of this species excavated in Pliocene deposits in Sivalik Hills and Narmada River valley revealed that the gharial probably evolved 42 million years ago.",Blueprint To Boost Gharial Population In Odisha’s Satkosia Gorge,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vb2Rpc2hhYnl0ZXMuY29tL2JsdWVwcmludC10by1ib29zdC1naGFyaWFsLXBvcHVsYXRpb24taW4tb2Rpc2hhcy1zYXRrb3NpYS1nb3JnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i1.wp.com/odishabytes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Gharial-crocodile.jpg?fit=250%2C151&ssl=1,2019-06-05,"{'sent': 'Concerned over the alarming fall in the number of gharials (fish-eating crocodiles) in Satkosia gorge, the 21-km narrow stretch of River Mahanadi near Tikarpada, about 60 km from Angul district, the authorities of Satkosia Wildlife Division and Nandanakan Zoo have prepared a blueprint to increase their population.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Satkosia', 'Tikarpada'], 'QUANTITY': ['60 km'], 'ORG': ['Nandanakan Zoo', 'Satkosia Wildlife Division']}}",Gharial
0,"Angul: Sharp decline in the Gharial (fish-eating crocodile) population at Satkosia gorge near Tikarpada area has raised serious concerns among the environmentalists and forest department. Blame it on overfishing, water pollution or lack of proper supervision, reports claimed that only four Gharials are present in the reserve.

Finally, officials of the forest department have decided to initiate measures to prevent the extinction of the endangered species.

According to sources, prior to the arrival of monsoon in Odisha, five Keto Gharials from Nandankanan would be released in the lake for successful breeding of the animals. Further, the officials are likely to impose a ban on fishing.

Though the idea gained positive response from the locals, the Satkosia fishermen community have demanded alternate measures for them before imposing fishing ban in the lake.

“It’s a very good initiative by the government. After releasing new species, care should be taken by the department for the protection of the species,” said a local, Binod Kumar Samal.

“We don’t agree that overfishing is the reason for decline of Gharial population. Steps should be taken to ensure that livelihood of the fishermen community is not affected,” said Advisor of Satkosia Fishermen Community, Manas Pal.

On the other hand, environmentalists are of the opinion that the existence of muggers and gharials together could be the reason for Gharial extinction.

“Without finding the reasons that leads to decline of Gharial, nothing can be achieved only by releasing animals,” said environmentalist Swapna Sarangi.

“It’s necessary to study the problems in the ecosystem that affect the survival of the animals. Initially, a few would be released and monitoring will be done to identify the problems that prevents their growth,” said Angul Regional Chief Conservator of Forests (RCCF), Pradeep Raj Karat.","Odisha!

""Carli"" is a 6-week-old Siberian tiger cub and only the second cub to be born in Great Adventure's facility. She's named after New Jersey native and soccer star Carli Lloyd, a player on U.S. Women's National Team.

Carli is being raised by Great Adventure's animal care team by hand until she can be reintroduced to her mother, Nadya.

“Nadya showed great mothering skills at first; but when she failed to nurse her cub, we stepped in,” Safari veterinarian Dr. Ken Keiffer said in a statement. “Today, Carli is doing extremely well. She weighs 12 pounds and when full grown, will weigh more than 500 lbs. Her large paws are indicative of the massive cat she will grow to become one day.”

Guests will be able to see Carli in Safari Discoveries soon, the amusement park announced.

Carli's mother, Nadya, was raised in a litter with an African lion three years ago at Great Adventure. The animal care team said it hopes the three cats can be bonded into a trio.

“Tigers are typically solitary animals, while lions are more social,"" Keiffer said. ""The strong bond that Carli’s mom Nadya shares with lion Zuri will hopefully mean that the trio will become their own pride one day.""

Devotees at the Khodiyar Mata temple in the Indian state of Gujarat had a surprise visitor yesterday, a crocodile. This was a miracle for the many worshippers of the temple’s deity, ‘Khodiya Mata’ or goddess Khodiyar whose mode of transport is believed to be a crocodile.

The crocodile attracted a large number of devotees after it strayed onto the premises of the temple in Gujarat’s Mahisagar district during the late hours of Sunday.

A video that went viral on social media showed the crocodile crawl into the sanctum sanctorum and sat there till the forest department came in to rescue the reptile.

Delay in rescue

The devotees allegedly caused a delay in the operation as they didn’t allow forest officials to rescue the crocodile. According to a report by Asian News International (ANI), Mahisagar’s Deputy Conservator of Forests R M Parmar said the people assembled at the temple delayed rescue operations by around two hours. “When our personnel reached there to rescue the crocodile, people opposed it. We waited for two hours as we did not want to hurt religious sentiments. However, later, we managed to get the reptile to a nearby pond,” Parmar added.

R V Patel, Range Forest Officer of the Mahisagar forest department said: “The crocodile is a giant one, it weighs 17kgs and is 6 feet long. We had a hard time rescuing it as a large number of devotees started worshipping the crocodile. Another problem that we faced while rescuing the crocodile was that the sanctum sanctorum was small in comparison to the crocodile. We have now released him into a nearby pond.”

Social media reacts

The video went viral and Indian news media outlets shared the story. Twitter users jumped in to react. While some said the crowd frenzy was unacceptable and the reptile should be rescued soon, others continued to call it a miracle.

@saurabh_singh27 tweeted: “What are they feeding the crocodile? Care should be taken for its rehabilitation and not let it die in crowd frenzy.”

Meanwhile, @kdramafanin questioned: “Are they serious? What if it harmed someone?”

Crocodile worship

Khodiyar Mata, the deity of the Patel community in the state, is often depicted in religious literature as riding on a crocodile.

According to R V Patel: “A large number of people who had assembled at the Khodiyar Temple... offered prayers, conducted prayer rituals and showered vermillion on the 6-foot reptile as it lay near the goddess’ idol.”

Many Hindu castes, especially the Leva Patels worship the Khodiyar Maa as the ‘Kuldevi’ or family deity. But crocodile worship is not unique to them. Crocodiles are worshipped in a number of different cultures.

Other instances in India

In January an entire village in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, mourned the death of a crocodile, whom they used to worship as their protector. For residents of the Bawa Mohtara village in Bemetara district, the around 130-year-old crocodile, whom they had fondly named as ‘Gangaram’, was extremely sacred.

After the reptile died in a village pond, grief-stricken residents took out its funeral procession and did not cook food that day.

In Kerala, a crocodile named Babiya guards the famous Ananthapura Lake Temple. According to an article on the Indian news website Indiatimes.com: “Legend has it that Babiya is a local guardian of the temple. Babiya only eats the temple prasad, which is made of rice and jaggery and does not harm anyone, including the fish in the lake. The crocodile is believed to be vegetarian and has been guarding the temple for more than 60 years.”

In Goa, a village worships crocodiles for bountiful crop yields. Annually, residents of Adulshem celebrate a peculiar agrarian cultural expression dedicated to crocodile worship. They make a dummy crocodile out of silt extracted from the land as villagers chant prayers for a better crop and fish yield.

Karachi’s crocodile shrine

Crocodiles play an important role in one of Karachi, Pakistan’s oldest Sufi shrines as well.

Haji Syed Shaikh Sultan who is more popularly known as Mangho Pir was a Sufi saint in Sindh, given the title of ‘Pir’ or saint by Baba Farid, a Punjabi Muslim preacher and mystic.

Located in present day Karachi, Mangho Pir’s shrine attracts many. The same name was also given to the area. While Sindh is known for being a sanctuary for many mystics of the past, the shrine of Mangho Pir features something very special – a pond full of crocodiles.

The reptiles are an essential part of the bustling ambience of the centuries-old shrine.

As hundreds flock to the resting place of the saint every day, visitors make sure to feed the crocodiles that are subject to many myths.

While it’s unclear what exactly is the link the reptiles had with the saint or how they got there, there are plenty of speculations by the locals.

Whatever the origin of the reptiles getting to Mangho Pir may be, one thing is clear, the visitors treat them with high regard.

The crocodiles are seen sunbathing in the water as visitors feed them with meat as well as Pakistani sweets like Halwa.

Many believe that the saint belonged to the Sheedi also known as the Makrani community, who have African heritage.

Every year, members of the ethnic group gather at Mangho Pir and celebrate a festival called the Sheedi Mela. According to a report by English-language Pakistani newspaper, The Daily Times, at the festival, the elders of this community call out the heaviest and biggest crocodiles from the pond. Once the reptiles are out, assigned caretakers feed them sweets and meat, as well as shower and adorn them with red roses.

Once the crocodile eats the meat and raises its neck above the ground, it is believed that the ritual has been completed and the offerings have been accepted by the creature.

Crocodile conservation in India

Crocodiles are Schedule 1 animals (provided absolute protection) as per the Indian Wildlife (Protection Act), 1972.

The Indian gharial (Gavialis Gangeticus), a close relative of the mugger crocodile, has been on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list for decades due to its rapidly declining population.

Once found in abundance in all rivers of India, this fish-eating reptile is now limited to just a few rivers. In 1975, the Indian Crocodile Conservation Project was set up with the support of the Government of India, initially in the Satkosia Gorge Sanctuary in the Indian state of Odisha. The project was implemented with the financial aid of the United Nations Development Fund and Food and Agriculture Organisation. A gharial breeding center was built in Nandankanan Zoological Park.

A male gharial was flown in from Frankfurt Zoological Garden to become one of the founding animals of the breeding program. In subsequent years, several protected areas were established.

In December 2010, the then Indian Minister for Environment and Forests, Jairam Ramesh announced the formation of a National Tri-State Chambal Sanctuary Management and Coordination Committee for gharial conservation along the Chambal River in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

According to an article in the Indian news magazine, India Today: “Due to extensive conservation efforts by wildlife departments in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and the relatively undisturbed riverine ecosystem of the Chambal which passes through these three states, gharial numbers have reached over 1,680 in the Chambal Sanctuary area.”",Crocodile strays into temple in India and gets worshipped,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vZ3VsZm5ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEvaW5kaWEvY3JvY29kaWxlLXN0cmF5cy1pbnRvLXRlbXBsZS1pbi1pbmRpYS1hbmQtZ2V0cy13b3JzaGlwcGVkLTEuNjQ4MTExMTPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2019/06/24/RDS_190624-Crocodile-in-temple-1561381899762_16b899d0df3_medium.jpg,2019-06-24,"{'sent': 'Devotees at the Khodiyar Mata temple in the Indian state of Gujarat had a surprise visitor yesterday, a crocodile.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Gujarat']}}",Gharial

A video posted on Twitter shows two girls briefly petting the elephant’s extended trunk before the animal quickly strikes a third girl in the face, knocking her cell phone out of her hands. The elephant then tries to grab the cell phone with its trunk before the man shooting the video picks it up.

The video has garnered 10.7 million views since being posted on June 28.

“I felt like 10 people had punched me at once as I was catapulted backward and my phone flew forward to the ground,” the Pennsylvania girl wrote in a letter to Fox News. “Yes, I had the wind knocked out of me, no it didn’t hurt, yes I’m okay, and yes I still love elephants!”

She was on a 12-day mission with her school, the broadcaster reported. The unnamed girl is a student at Grace Prep in State College in Pennsylvania. The man who posted the video to Twitter is the principle of the college, according to his Twitter bio.

They had just arrived in Zambia after a 30-hour flight.

“So that evening we planned on taking a nice walk to dinner but before we did, we saw the beautiful elephant perched on the edge of its evening enclosement. (This was a female elephant that has the freedom to roam in its 10,000-acre reserve all day and voluntarily returns each night for a meal and a bath.),”

“One of the best parts is that it was all captured on video so everyone, knowing I was okay, could get a good laugh out of it,” the girl told Fox News.

In Africa, elephants can be found across 37 countries. Africa holds two different species of elephants, the African savannah elephant, and the African forest elephant, according to Elephants for Africa.

An elephant’s trunk is a fusion between its upper lip and its nose. The trunk alone can weigh up to 310 pounds and can hold up over three gallons of water. Elephants can use their trunks both for aggressiveness and affection, and to pick up objects.

Another Elephant Attack

Last month, an animal trainer was seriously injured after an elephant attacked him at a wildlife park in Canada, reported CBC.

The park employee had to be air-lifted to the hospital. The circumstances around the incident have not been revealed, according to the news outlet.

The African Lion Safari in Ontario holds 16 Asian elephants, the largest herd of any North American zoo.

That’s not the first time an elephant hurt an employee at the park. In 1989, a 21-year-old man was killed by an elephant at the African Lion Safari. He was crushed when the elephant leaned its head on him after knocking him to the ground.

The elephant was fighting with another elephant when Omer Norton tried to grab a tool to break up the fight, CBC reported. The park said it was the first time an elephant had shown aggression towards a human there.",Elephant Smacks Girl in the Face Then Tries to Take Her Cell Phone: Video,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbWIubnRkLmNvbS9lbGVwaGFudC1zbWFja3MtZ2lybC1pbi10aGUtZmFjZS10aGVuLXRyaWVzLXRvLXRha2UtaGVyLWNlbGwtcGhvbmUtdmlkZW9fMzU1MDI0Lmh0bWzSAWxodHRwczovL3d3dy5udGQuY29tL2VsZXBoYW50LXNtYWNrcy1naXJsLWluLXRoZS1mYWNlLXRoZW4tdHJpZXMtdG8tdGFrZS1oZXItY2VsbC1waG9uZS12aWRlb18zNTUwMjQuaHRtbC9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.ntd.com/assets/uploads/2019/05/elephant-africa-e1562787269709.jpg,2019-07-10,"{'sent': 'An African elephant smacked a girl in the face with its trunk while she was taking a photo of the animal at a wildlife park in Zambia.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Zambia']}}",Elephant
0,"Faced with the ever-present threat of poaching, conservancies, game reserves, and national parks in Africa are gearing themselves up with technology to protect their diverse animals.

Africa is home to some of the most sought-after animals on the black market, and this is why anti-poaching technology is all the more important.

To learn more about the kind of technology that African organizations have been deploying, The Sociable spoke with Damian Otieno, who manages the Conservation Tech Lab at Ol Pejeta, a private conservancy located on Kenya’s Laikipia plateau.

Ol Pejeta is home to the only two remaining northern white rhinos on the planet, among other endangered giants.

“At this rate, the African elephant will be extinct in 11 years”

Launched recently, the Conservation Tech Lab at Ol Pejeta claims to be the world’s first wildlife tech lab that is exploring different technologies to be plugged into conservation efforts to help protect wildlife and biodiversity.

According to Otieno, an elephant dies of poaching every 15 minutes.

“At this rate, the African elephant will be extinct in 11 years,” he says.

Naturally, the challenges that a conservancy like Ol Pejeta faces are quite different from what one might face in another setting such as cities and towns, hence their strategies of meeting these challenges are unique as well.

As Otieno says, “To fight the challenges, we don’t just get up in the morning and develop solutions for conservation. We go to the field and speak to conservationists, people in wildlife, and groups on the ground. That’s how we know about the challenges they face each and every day in their operations, and from that we start thinking of the technology we can innovate or deploy to make their work easy.”

Otieno is a computer scientist who left his corporate job for a career in conservation tech.

“I kept asking myself, ‘As a technology or computer person, what is it that I can do to have an impact in people’s lives? How can I give back to the community? An opportunity arose in Ol Pejeta Conservancy and I went for it,” he reminisces.

Poaching Threats To Conservation

This slideshow requires JavaScript.

Otieno says that game reserves and conservancies mostly face poaching threats like armed incursions that mainly target high-value animals such as rhinos or elephants.

The most valuable of animals include the black rhinoceros, which are large animals that can weigh up to 3,000 pounds. Their prominent horn can grow up to five feet in length, a major attraction for poachers. Poachers, loss of habitat, and competition for food, are rendering this species critically endangered.

Another species that is endangered due to poaching, predation, and overgrazing, is the Grevy’s zebra. These beautiful animals are also known as the Imperial zebra, and are the largest living wild equid and the largest and most threatened of the three species of zebra.

Elephants are another dwindling species, that face threats of extinction because of the illicit ivory trade.

Animal Monitoring – The Main Challenge for Conservation Spaces

One of the key areas that needs looking into and exploring with technology is monitoring. To deal with this problem, the Conservation Tech Lab has developed a system from scratch to finish.

“Before, we didn’t have eyes on the ground, but now we do, which can help against poaching”

Just outside Ol Pejeta’s fence are several communities. Animals from the conservancy often stray into these communities, and people like Otieno are looking at how to bring these communities closer by giving them tools to easily communicate with the conservancy instead of harming the animals.

“The two spaces around the conservancy called Wildlife Corridor allow the free movement of animals in and out. Some of the communities might take out a machete and kill the animals, but we don’t want that. We want them to communicate with us,” he says.

Anti-Poaching Technology in Use at Ol Pejeta

Ol Pejeta has been teching up to meet its daily poaching challenges with a variety of exciting equipment that might be straight out of a modern safari movie.

Turbonet Radio

Apart from basic equipment like binoculars for rangers, who patrol from a safe undetected distance, Ol Pejeta has a digital radio system with GPS tracking capability for rangers, which they rolled out in October 2013.

This has helped assess on-going field patrol activity from the headquarters, providing on-screen location, distribution of teams at any given time, and analysis of patrol coverage on Google maps by patrol teams. This in turn assists in planning of deployments to address observed patrol gaps.

The equipment can be used to send distress signal without having to speak and offers superb signal coverage and clarity compared to analogue systems. The system also allows for private text messages and calls to be sent between radios.

“Turbonet radios allow our boots on the ground and rangers to easily communicate and pass on messages regarding any occurrence in the conservancy,” says Otieno.

Camera Traps

The conservancy has three infra-red motion-triggered cameras, placed on key wildlife pathways. Some of the cameras were donated by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), while others are borrowed from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

“We have had a couple of incidents in the last one-two months, where we spotted people trying to come into the conservation area,”

Apart from keeping an eye on poachers, these cameras provide insight into the behavior of many of the conservancy’s wildlife species, such as elephant herds, lions, hyenas, zebra and in some cases jackals, wild dogs, and a few antelope species, that too without disturbing them.

“We know all the activity that’s happening in the corridors now. Before, we didn’t have eyes on the ground, but now we do, which can help against poaching.”

Earthranger

The conservancy also uses Earthranger, a software platform that collects information on activity in a protected area, bringing information into a single, integrated, real-time visualized operational platform. The information includes the animals and assets being protected via trackers, the rangers protecting animals via digital radios, and threats or potential poaching via ranger reports.

Electrical Fence

Ol Pejeta has an electrical fence that goes round the perimeter of its 360 km2 of area. The fence is always powered to deter poachers from crossing into the conservancy and carrying out nefarious activities.

“To bolster the fence-line security front, we also test out fence-monitoring devices that notify us in real time if a fence section suddenly becomes unpowered,” Otieno says.

High-Tech Anti-Poaching Wish List

While Otieno is proud of what the Conservancy Tech Lab has been able to achieve so far, what would be the ultimate high-tech anti-poaching equipment he would wish for? His prompt answer included a whole list of tech.

Camera-Equipped Drones

Camera-equipped drones are at the top of Otieno’s list, which can remotely photograph poachers in their hide outs, which are usually difficult-to-reach areas. Autonomous network-connected series of drones that are able to follow a 3D object such as a poacher could also be deployed for anti-poaching efforts.

“Instead of sending a ranger into a car to go and find out exactly what is going on, we can launch a drone with speakers and analytics, which zeroes in on the poachers and says, ‘Hey! you have trespassed. Get out!’” he says.

Real-Time Cameras with Analytics and Thermal Capabilities

Another equipment he wishes for is the use of video cameras armed with analytics and thermal capabilities to monitor the fence line.

Read More: Will AR, VR kill zoos or is it time for zoos to tech up?

“The analytics could identify humans who tamper with or get very close to the fence. When they cross over the fence, the camera analytics could then be used to track their movement. It would be nice to have analytical functions that can distinguish a poacher from a ranger. Sometimes, even in real time, people can’t really tell a lion from a gazelle,” Otieno says.

He would also like thermal cameras to track poachers at night when there is low visibility.

Fiber Optic Distributed Acoustic Sensing

These sophisticated-sounding systems detect vibrations and capture acoustic energy along the optical fiber, which then functions as if there were thousands of microphones installed, Otieno explains. Classification algorithms are used to detect and locate, for example, intrusion activities, leaks, or other abnormal sounds.

“I think the technology being deployed at Ol Pejeta can easily be scaled to other conservation spaces around Kenya, Africa, and also the world”

“This technology, if deployed along our fence line or across key hot-spot areas, would allow Ol Pejeta to get real-time alert of any intrusion activity as it occurs,” he says.

Animal Trackers for Key Species

Another equipment on Otieno’s wish list are trackers placed in key endangered animals to monitor them and track them much more efficiently, thus ensuring their safety from poachers.

“Ol pejeta is around 360 km2 and I’m looking at applications whereby, I can sit down and still move around the whole conservation space. If there is a break-in somewhere, some form of analytics and proper acoustics should send data in form of notifications,” he says.

Support for Setting Up Conservation Technology

Otieno says that while working with animals and nature, it becomes inevitable for an idea like the Conservation Tech Lab to conceptualize.

“In places like Ol Pejeta, when you work very closely with fauna and flora as our partners, such ideas get socialized. That is how we could set up funding from world foundations to set up this 40-foot container,” he says, referring to the retrofitted shipping container, where the Conservation Tech Lab exists right now.

He explains that Ol Pejeta has a unique business model combining tourism and cattle ranching, which allows it to meet its main expenses from the income it generates.

However, projects that are capital intensive generally tend to be donor funded. Donors can support the projects in various ways from providing kits, trainings, and waivers to software fees and, of course, monetary donation.

“It would be nice to have analytical functions that can distinguish a poacher from a ranger. Sometimes, even in real time, people can’t really tell a lion from a gazelle”

“The government is the custodian of the wildlife of Kenya and is very interested in their conservation. It supports through various trainings on conservation practices and through its national police rangers, who guard and secure the various conservancies and parks,” he says.

The conservancy also received help from United Wild Life and the WWF.

“Right now we are looking for more funding from other people. We are trying to embrace meaningful partnerships with other people to see how we can move forward,” he adds.

Ol Pejeta’s Tech Plans for the Future

Poaching is a widespread issue across Africa and several conservancies are applying technologies in an effort to curb the vice.

For example, in a wildlife preserve in Zimbabwe, some of the rhinos roaming the park have sensors embedded in their horns. The trackers send the animals’ GPS locations to solar-powered base stations three times a day, which then send the data to rangers through a mobile app.

In the future, the conservancy is looking to have Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) thermal cameras along their fence line that will allow their rangers to spot a poacher even in the night. They are also seeking permission from the government to have Sigfox or LoRa rhino trackers, which would allow more efficient monitoring and security for their key species.

“I think the technology being deployed at Ol Pejeta can easily be scaled to other conservation spaces around Kenya, Africa, and also the world,” Otieno says.

“At any given point in time, when you want to scale that technology, we have the knowledge, the expertise, to advise other people on how best to embrace this technology. Also, we can choose the technology wisely,” he concludes.",‘At this rate the African elephant will be extinct in 11 years’: conservation tech lab,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vc29jaWFibGUuY28vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hdC10aGlzLXJhdGUtdGhlLWFmcmljYW4tZWxlcGhhbnQtd2lsbC1iZS1leHRpbmN0LWluLTExLXllYXJzLWNvbnNlcnZhdGlvbi10ZWNoLWxhYi_SAXdodHRwczovL3NvY2lhYmxlLmNvL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvYXQtdGhpcy1yYXRlLXRoZS1hZnJpY2FuLWVsZXBoYW50LXdpbGwtYmUtZXh0aW5jdC1pbi0xMS15ZWFycy1jb25zZXJ2YXRpb24tdGVjaC1sYWIvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://sociable.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/african-bush-elephants.jpg,2019-07-18,"{'sent': ': 3D printing can end poaching, flood market with indistinguishable counterfeits\n\nTo learn more about the kind of technology that African organizations have been deploying, The Sociable spoke with Damian Otieno, who manages the Conservation Tech Lab at Ol Pejeta, a private conservancy located on Kenya’s Laikipia plateau.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['3D'], 'PERSON': ['Damian Otieno'], 'GPE': ['Kenya']}}",Elephant

The horrific images were captured in Botswana, where poaching has surged in recent years after a ban was lifted. The number of carcasses abused in the Northern parts of the country increased by 593 percent between 2014 and 2018. The devastating new images, shot by award-winning documentary filmmaker Justin Sullivan, show the helpless elephant’s severed trunk is clearly visible.

Poachers used a chainsaw to cut off the trunk and tusks, just 20 minutes away from a nearby camp. Mr Sullivan, 28, from Cape Town, South Africa, said he was filming for a private company in Botswana and overheard rangers talking about the poached elephant. He said: “They said an elephant had just been poached and I asked to be taken to the site. ""On arrival I used a drone to capture the image.”

The drone images show a mutilated elephant murdered by poachers

Every day 100 elephants are poached in Africa for their tusks, with a pound of illegal ivory worth around £1,000 on the black markets of the Far East. Mr Sullivan added: “People have obviously reacted with mixed feelings of anger and sadness, especially with the recent lift on the hunting ban in Botswana. “But this photo has driven some constructive dialogue around how we can promote more sustainable elephant conversation and solve our current ecological crisis.” The photograph has now been selected for the prestigious Andrei Stenin International Press Photo Contest, the results of which will be announced in September.

Athlete Chuck Patterson managed to capture the footage when the dolphins surrounded a boat he was sailing with friends.

He wrote on Facebook: “Absolutely amazing witnessing this huge pod of young dolphins marching up the coast off Laguna Beach today.

“Mother Nature’s amazing wonders never disappoint. Highlighting the importance in protecting this magic by cleaning up our oceans and use of single use plastics.""

Patterson told Reuters that there were likely more than 100 dolphins in the pod that raced them up the coast.

Southern California is said to have the greatest density of dolphins per square mile than any other location on Earth.

That figure includes nearly 450,000 common dolphins, the creatures that are thought to be in the video.

Experts think that large megapods of dolphins can contain up to 10,000 dolphins and it is possible that there were many more dolphins under the surface in the latest megapod video footage.

Dolphins normally live in pods of 12 but these groups can stampede together and form a megapod.

Stampeding is unusual behaviour for dolphins so it is rarely witnessed but it can happen if dolphins are trying to avoid a predator, chase a boat or sometimes just without warning and for no apparent reason.

Dolphin facts Here's what you need to know about the cute creatures... Dolphins are small toothed aquatic mammals and there are currently almost 40 different species of them

There are 36 dolphin species, which can be found in every ocean but there are a few of them that live in freshwater streams and rivers like the South Asian river dolphin and the Amazon river dolphin

Despite their name, Killer Whales are actually the largest kind of dolphin and can grow up to 30 feet long

Sometimes Killer Whales prey upon other dolphins

Common dolphins mostly eat fish and squid

They use echolocation to navigate the ocean and find prey, which involves creating sound waves to bounce off objects so they can work out things like size and distance

An echolocating dolphin can make up to 1,000 clicking noises per second

They are very sociable, playful animals and are constantly commincating with each other

They normally live in pods of around 12 but can form a 'megapod' with other nearby dolphins in rare situations, such as if they are avoiding predators

We don't know for certain how long the average dolphin lifespan is but female bottlenose dolphins have been known to live for more than 60 years and females tend to outlive males

Dolphins can reach speeds of more than 18 miles an hour and often like to swim alongside boats

The species is listed as endangered by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), meaning tigers as a whole are considered to face a ""very high risk of extinction in the wild.""

The WWF, which describes itself as the world's leading conservation organization, reports that 93% of historical tiger habitats have completely disappeared because of human activity.

With habitat loss and poaching, tigers in the wild face several obstacles. Today, some 3,900 tigers live in the wild, according to estimates from the WWF. There were once eight tiger subspecies, but three are now extinct, leaving five subspecies, according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service.

0,"After a decade at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Msholo the African elephant has a new home.

Msholo (mi-SHOW-low) is now housed at the Zambezi Elephant Center at Zoo Atlanta, where he arrived Wednesday. Zoo Atlanta’s two female African elephants, Kelly and Tara, arrived June 16. The move is meant to partly benefit the species, but also to give the 30-year-old male some new companions.

All three will be visible to the public at Zoo Atlanta’s new African Savanna habitat, which opens Aug. 8. The center and habitat can house seven elephants. The area is three times the size of the older area and includes pachydermic amenities such as a pond and two waterfalls.

Moving an 11,000-pound elephant is a logistical feat not undertaken lightly.

“In this case the move took a couple of days and a large team of people,” San Diego Zoo spokeswoman Christina Simmons said by email. Beforehand, keepers worked with Msholo to prepare him for things he would experience with the move, such as entering a crate.

The transfer was done in accordance with a Species Survival Plan adhered to by zoos in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, (AZA) Simmons said.

“The decision is made by reviewing the natural history of the species, individual history of the animal, current and potential destination facilities,” Simmons said. “Adult male African elephants generally move between social groups, spending a large amount of time on their own, with other males or with female elephant herds.”

Msholo was brought to the United States from Swaziland in 2003, part of a group of elephants rescued from a planned culling. He was first sent to Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo. In 2009 he was brought to the Safari Park, with the hope he would breed with female African elephants there, Simmons said.

“Unfortunately after 10 years here he has never fathered offspring,” Simmons said. “He has, however, served an important role in our herd, by providing a dominant male figure that has helped teach our young males as they have grown up, helping them develop into the well-behaved young men they have become.”

Meanwhile at Zoo Atlanta, the upgraded habitat provides favorable terrain for breeding — and new companions. The females, Kelly and Tara,are both 36 years old. They arrived at Zoo Atlanta in 1986 and are closely bonded, spokeswoman Rachel Davis said by email.

Elephants can live up to 60 or 70 years in the wild. Females stop bearing calves around the age of 50. That means there’s plenty of time for Msholo, Kelly, and Tara to contribute to the survival of their species.

Zoo Atlanta’s new African Savanna is part of a “major transformation of the Zoo,” Davis said.

“We’ve talked to many zoos with elephants since the project became a reality,” she added, “and are working with the AZA Elephant SSP and other zoological organizations with elephants to utilize our new facility to enhance both elephant care and sustainability.”","Msholo the African elephant leaves San Diego Zoo Safari Park for new home, companions",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbmRpZWdvdW5pb250cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3N0b3J5LzIwMTktMDctMjYvbXNob2xvLWVsZXBoYW50LXRyYW5zZmVy0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2FuZGllZ291bmlvbnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL25ld3MvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvc3RvcnkvMjAxOS0wNy0yNi9tc2hvbG8tZWxlcGhhbnQtdHJhbnNmZXI_X2FtcD10cnVl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5fbeff2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5472x2873+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe4%2Fbd%2F0b06ff3249379b3a118f3c497cf9%2Fafrican-elephant-msholo-photo-credit-san-diego-zoo-safari-park.jpg,2019-07-27,"{'sent': 'After a decade at San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Msholo the African elephant has a new home.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Msholo']}}",Elephant

BRIDGEPORT — Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo celebrated International Tiger Day Monday with an announcement that it had received more than $3 million to create a new Amur tiger habitat.

The zoo began a campaign to create a new, more spacious home for the endangered species after the birth of four cubs in November 2017, only two of which survived.

Pamela Kochiss Werth, a longtime Bridgeport resident and supporter of the zoo, stepped forward, pledging up to $1 million toward the construction as long as it was matched, said her brother, Ken Kochiss.

“She heard there was a need and wanted to respond,” said Kochiss, who represented the family Monday at the zoo.

The additional money for the construction project — $2.5 million — is being donated by the city, Mayor Joe Ganim said.

“People need to know what a great great place this is for children ... and people of all ages to enjoy,” Ganim said.

The donation has already gotten the ball rolling on phase one of the construction, said Zoo Director Gregg Dancho. A zoo architect has begun developing plans to at least double the size of the current habitat.

The new habitat will offer more holding space for the tigers and make it easier for the public to view them, Dancho said.

The habitat is currently home to three Amur tigers: a mother, Shangbai, and her two cubs, Zaya and Reka.

Amur tigers, once known as Siberian tigers, are a rare subspecies of tiger native to southeast Russia as well as areas of China and North Korea and are the largest cats in the world.

In the past century, the tiger population has steadily declined as a result of habitat loss, poaching and loss of prey.

Four of nine subspecies of tiger have disappeared from the wild and those remaining are thought to occupy less than 7 percent of their original range, according to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

All three of Beardsley’s Amur tigers are part of the AZA’s Species Survival Plan, an effort to conserve population sizes of certain endangered species.

“We’ve helped with population growth and hopefully we can further help the population of this endangered species,” Dancho said.

The announcement concluded with Sean-Michael Green, president of the zoo’s board of directors, presenting Ganim with a plaque to commemorate his tiger conservation advocacy.

Also present at the announcement were several zoo volunteers, all of whom said they were excited about the donations.

“What was years away just got a lot closer,” said Docent Scott Sherrin.

The zoo hopes to begin construction on the new habitat sometime this year so that the work is done by the zoo’s 100th anniversary in 2022.",Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo receives more than $3 million for tiger habitat,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEI4KXfeNBct7UwSaodonboQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow8dv9CjDw5_UCMO_i1wU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/04/42/16/17965980/7/rawImage.jpg,2019-07-29,"{'sent': 'Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo receives more than $3 million for tiger habitat\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Connecticut'], 'ORG': ['Beardsley Zoo'], 'MONEY': ['more than $3 million']}}",Tiger

China has built a monitoring network for engendered Siberian tigers and Amur leopards, covering more than 12,000 square kilometers in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, after nearly 20 years' efforts, said an official on Sunday.

Jiang Guangshun, deputy director of Feline Research Center of the Natural Forestry and Grassland Administration, made the remarks at the International Forum on Tiger and Leopard Transboundary Conservation in Harbin, Heilongjiang province.

With cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data, Jiang and his team have recorded more than 4,000 infrared camera video clips of tigers and more than 600 clips of leopards, according to Jiang's report about conservation and management of Siberian tigers and Amur leopards at the forum.

""By comparing the data of tigers and leopards of China and Russia from 2013 to 2015, we confirmed that 17 tigers and 42 leopards are shared populations of both China and Russia,"" he said. ""Ecological environment has greatly improved since the natural forest protection project started in 1998 and all commercial logging has been stopped, which helped in protecting of tigers and leopards.""

""However, we still face great challenges in the following areas,"" he said. ""Distribution pattern of the two species suggests that the protection of the Amur tiger and leopard requires the establishment of a network of protected patch sites, the construction of international and domestic corridors, and the formation of a permeable landscape. It needs attention and support from all over the world.""

""The protection also needs an international research team to improve the level of the global transboundary data and management of tigers and leopards,"" Jiang added.

Focusing on big cats all around the world, especially tiger and leopard populations, the two-day event attracted more than 300 representatives from 19 regional countries, including Nepal, Russia, Vietnam, and 10 international organizations, including World Wildlife Fund.

Representatives will have discussions on monitoring technology, restoration of populations and habitats, landscape resource allocation in protected areas, conflict resolution and other related technical and policy issues.

Furthermore, the establishment of international exchange and cooperation mechanism for cross-border protection of tigers and leopards is expected to get important progress in the future.","China completes 12,000 sq km of monitoring area for Siberian Tigers, Amur leopards",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2hpbmFkYWlseS5jb20uY24vYS8yMDE5MDcvMjkvV1M1ZDNlYWY1YWEzMTBkODMwNTY0MDE5MjcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201907/29/5d3eaf5aa310d8304553598e.jpeg,2019-07-29,"{'sent': ""The International Forum on Tiger and Leopard Transboundary Conservation kicks off in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang province, on Sunday.[Photo"", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Leopard Transboundary Conservation'], 'GPE': ['Harbin', 'Heilongjiang province']}}",Tiger
0,"TEHRAN – The outstanding Caspian tigers once roamed over most of northern provinces of Iran, have gone extinct half a century ago, but recent studies show that tigers can make a comeback using the Siberian tiger subspecies, which detected genetic similarities with the Caspian tiger. But here the question arises that can Iran get a second chance to return the big cats and not lose them again?

Once the tigers were predicted to soon become extinct in the world if effective conservation measures are not deployed, July 29 was observed as a day dedicated to awareness and support worldwide to conserve the tigers whose population dropped dramatically to less than 4,000 individuals in the wild.

Caspian tiger’s roar has not been heard for years

Once upon a time, the Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) ranged from eastern Turkey through the southern Caspian region of northern Iran to the forested areas in Afghanistan, and northwestern China.

Since the beginning of 19th century, the Caspian tiger was rapidly losing ground to humankind, thus it was deprived of its habitat and prey and soon became a beast in its own territory, so conflicts started to hunt them down as a menace to human settlements.

Therefore, in the mid-20th century, their population whose genetic roots spanned over a million years started to shrink sharply, and finally vanished by the 1950s.

Although, there are reports of the last remaining Caspian tiger which was shot in Golestan National Park in 1953, five years later, some claimed that a tiger has been spotted in Golestan area.

The Department of Environment’s experts have tried to find evidence of Caspian tiger existence searching their previous habitats for several years in the early 1970s, but not a single sign has been found.

Caspian tigers had been protected since 1957, with heavy fines for shooting, but it was too late for the majestic cat to make a recovery. Excessive hunting, poaching, habitat fragmentation, food shortages, poisoning and trapping wiped out the valuable species.

An old picture of Caspian tiger in Iran

Initial attempts to bring back formidable tigers

In the Iranian calendar year 1389 (March 2009- March 2010), two Siberian tigers were sent to Iran from Russia in exchange of two Persian Leopards; aiming to restore the Caspian tiger generation in the country, but after a while the male one died due to an outbreak of glanders (an infectious disease occurs primarily by ingestion of contaminated food or water).

The female tiger was quarantined for five years on the charge of being infected with the virus, but with the help of wildlife enthusiasts and the DOE after undergoing several medical tests, the animal was then moved to a suitable place in Tehran Zoo.

DNA tests added a spark of hope to the sad story

Although, 8 subspecies of tigers have been identified, in 2004 scientists revised the known classification to five subspecies from those previously identified, as they had been from a genetic standpoint that were separated by humans after years.

Lately, researchers and studies proposed that restoring the lost cats is possible, as the Siberian or Amur tiger show genetic kinship to the Caspian, because they once ruled from Caspian Sea's south shore to the forest areas of China and Korea, north to the forested edges of Siberia, while human cleaved their territory in two, separating the Caspian tiger from the Siberian.

But the question come up that whether the current nature of Iran has the capacity to accept and remain such an enormous species? And is it possible to revive a species which once gone extinct in the same region?

How Caspian tiger faded away in Iran?

Kaveh Feizollahi, a zoologist and an expert in the field of tigers, told IRNA that “tigers are flexible species which can adopt to a wide range of habitat and climate conditions, from the tropical regions of Asia to the ever-snowy areas of Siberia.

On the other hand, their reproductive rate is relatively high and the gap between the regenerations is short; it can change its hunting technique depending on the prey and habitat. However, some of its features have made it vulnerable to human development in West Asia.

The first feature of tigers which caused them to disappear was tiger's dependence on the water resources and its presence near river basins, lake edges and sea shores, where the highest concentration of human population exists and the conflicts pushed them toward extinction.

The second one is related to the prey, the natural prey they mainly fed on was deer, and they attracted to northern Iran probably because of the good population of red deer and roe deer.

However, with population of deer declined, the tiger was inevitably feeding on the wild boar, which has severe population fluctuations and is a temporary source of food.

The third item is hunting, tiger hunting intensified during their final periods living in Iran, due to the reduction of prey and hunting livestock.

Tiger cubs were also captured for illegal trade, in addition, land use changes, superstitions and using their organs in traditional medicine were among the other factors eradicated tigers.”

Is it possible to bring back the vanished Caspian tiger?

Feizollahi went on to say that “the word ""possibility"" is usually used in two distinct meanings; if the word means the possibility of a theoretical and scientific idea in an ideal setting, then the answer is yes.

But it is very unlikely, as it is used in its daily sense, according to the records and conditions of the country's wildlife.

Assuming that the word ""possibility"" has been used in the first sense, it should be said that before any such project is started, a feasibility study must first be prepared. However, such a report was not prepared till December 2010, when the DOE representatives went to St. Petersburg to attend the international tiger conservation forum.”

“Certainly, there is no proper habitat for tiger in Iran. If there are intentions to revive the tiger population in Iran, or, in other words, to ensure a stable population of it, a natural habitat must be prepared, including, good vegetation cover, clean water and enough bait.

Before restoring the Caspian tiger in the country, other species of red and roe deer must be increased; for example, 20 tigers in a hypothetical area may need a population of 10,000 large mammals, which may take several years to expand.

After that, the tigers must gradually enter the prepared area; If there is no wild tiger, the tigers kept in captivity should be used as a parent and re-wild their cubs.

The whole process is very difficult, costly, and time consuming.

What the DOE did, the transfer of two Siberian tigers from a Russia to a wildlife park in Iran has nothing to do with a conservation program,” he explained.

He went on to add that to start conservation process, one should initially notice the reason behind Caspian tiger reintroduction in Iran; merely restoring an extinct species out of curiosity or enthusiasm toward history, or using a flag species to attract people's attention and support, while playing the international role of Iran in protecting global biodiversity.

Why conservation of tigers is important?

“In fact, saving the tiger from extinction and maintaining its habitat is the biggest concern of the international community for the conservation of biodiversity, because if we cannot save a precious and flexible specie like tiger from extinction, there is no hope to save the more unknown species that do not attract attention, and the world will be depopulated of animals.

According to an article released in 2010, the cost of protecting each wild tiger was estimated at $10,000 per year, while the price of a tiger skin on the smuggling market is twice that.

This will require an annual budget of $40 million to protect tigers in the world. One of the conservation activists pointed out that the budget in global economy is less than a drop of water,” he concluded.

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – A Montgomery County zoo will be adding an exhibit for the largest cat in the world after receiving a donation from a garbage collection service. The Elmwood Park Zoo announced Thursday the J.P. Mascaro & Sons Foundation donated $2 million for the addition of a brand new Amur tiger exhibit.

Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest cats in the world and are a highly threatened species.

The Elmwood Park Zoo says the tigers can still be found in parts of the forest in eastern Russia, parts of China, and possibly North Korea.

This is the first time in the zoo’s 95-year history that tigers will call the Norristown zoo home.

The exhibit is expected to open in 2022.

“J. P. Mascaro & Sons Foundations has provided a tremendous amount of support to the community for many, many years. It’s truly inspiring,” said Al Zone, Elmwood Park Zoo Executive Director and CEO. “They’ve also funded several of the zoo’s programs and services, which has benefited thousands of our guests and the people we meet in our community outreach. J. P. Mascaro & Sons Foundations has helped the zoo to grow and succeed, and their gift of a new tiger exhibit promises to take us to a whole new level.”

The donation is being made in memory of Francesco A. Mascaro and Rosemarie Mascaro Venditti, siblings of the Mascaro company owners.

“The Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown is a quality operation that is enjoyed by local area residents. Our family has its roots in the Norristown area, and we are happy to be able to make the zoo’s new tiger exhibit a reality,” said Joseph P. Mascaro, Jr., the oldest of the Mascaro brothers. “My brother Frank always had a soft spot in his heart for the zoo, and no one loved animals more than my sister, Rosie. Our company is pleased to make this tiger exhibit donation to the zoo in their memory.”",Elmwood Park Zoo Adding Siberian Tiger Exhibit Funded By J.P.

0,"A Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica; locally known as shushuk) has died due to use of illegal current net for fishing in Pashru river in Rampal upazila of Bagerhat.

The eight-foot long marine mammal, also known as Gangetic dolphin, was found dead and floating in the river at Bara Durgapur area in the upazila on Wednesday night and was later recovered, reports our Bagerhat correspondent.

“A net was found attached to its teeth. The shushuk died of suffocation after being entangled in fishing net,” said Md Madinatul Ahasan, divisional forest officer.

“Shushuk and Irrawaddy dolphins are often found dead being stuck in illegal fishing nets. Especially in the Sundarbans and adjacent coastal rivers, these two species are found relatively more, and are in higher risk of getting killed due to use of banned fishing nets and river pollution,” said Md Nur Alam Sheikh, water keeper of Pashur river.

‘‘The presence of dolphins in any river is a very reliable determinant of ecology, biodiversity and natural health. Two species of dolphins can be found in the rivers of Bangladesh – Gangetic (shushuk) and Irrawaddy. Among these, the presence of freshwater shushuk is found in small rivers of the country. The uncontrolled use of fishing nets and poisons are making these aquatic animals endangered,’’ he added.

Between 2007 and 2013, 90 aquatic mammals have been killed after being stuck in illegal current nets in the country, including 63 Gangetic and 16 Irrawaddy dolphins, a forest official told The Daily Star wishing anonymity.

0,"Killing dolphins of any species is a criminal offence under wildlife law

More than 100 shushuks (or South Asian river dolphin) and dolphins were found dead in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, in the last 12 years.

According to these statistics, an average of nine shushuk and dolphins are killed every year.

Wildlife Conservation Society Bangladesh (WCS Bangladesh) reports that one third of the dolphins are killed as they get tangled in the net and die of asphyxiation.

On July 31, a shushuk, which weighed more than 120 kgs and was eight feet long, was found dead in Durgapur upazila in Rampal, Bagerhat after it got tangled in a fishing net.

The report also confirmed that from 2007 to 2019, a total of 108 dolphins died. Of these, 80 were shushuk, 24 were Irrawaddy dolphins and four were wingless porpoise dolphins. Some died after getting tangled in the current net that is normally used to catch ilish fish, while others died by being hit by boats.

Madinul Ahsan, the divisional forest officer of Wildlife Management and Nature Conservation Division, has said that 14 dolphins and shushuk have been killed in the Sundarbans, over the last six years.

He said a shushuk was found floating dead on Mongla River on July 31. The dead dolphin had its teeth tangled in the fishing net. An autopsy was conducted to find out the cause of death.

According to the Wildlife (Conservation and Security) Act 2012, killing dolphins that lives in rivers is a punishable offense.

It is reported that shushuk and irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) dolphin often get trapped in fishing nets in the Sundarbans region and adjoining rivers.

The dolphins can sometimes be seen floating around the rivers or seas to breathe, and getting trapped in the net creates issues as they cannot breathe while entangled in the fishermen's nets.

Most of the time, it is seen that teeth of the shushuk and fins of irrawaddy dolphins get tangled in the net, which in turn kills the dolphins.

Current conditions of dolphins

“Identifying Dolphin Hotspots in South Eastern Bangladesh,” a report titled by WCS Bangladesh, said 225 shushuk are found in less saline water in Sundarbans.

According to the survey conducted in January 2018, there are 159 shushuks.

In another survey conducted in 2006, there were 451 Irrawaddy dolphins but the number decreased to 198 when the survey was again conducted from January to April 2019.

Nadim Parves, WCS Bangladesh's Education and Livelihood Coordinator, said that killing, hunting, eating, or selling dolphins of any species is a criminal offence.

“Dolphins help keep rivers and seas healthy. Moreover, reducing the number of dolphins means there is a decrease in the amount of fish; their disappearance will have a negative impact on our lives. Therefore, protecting these dolphins is everyone's duty,” he said.

He added: “Untangling a shushuk or dolphin from a fisherman’s net is an easy task. WCS, local fishermen, and the Citizen Science Fisherman Safety Network are now working together to protect dolphins and turtles once they get trapped in the fishing net.”

Furthermore, WCS is collecting information about dolphins dying in the Sundarbans and surrounding areas through the help of the Dolphin Mortality Monitoring Network, Nadim said. Through the help of the findings and contributions from the WCS study, the government of Bangladesh created three sanctuaries for dolphins in the Sundarbans.

“WCS believes that through the collaboration and joint effort of the government, fisheries and locals, the Sundarbans can be safe for dolphins,” he expressed hope.",Over 100 dolphins found dead in Sundarbans in last 12 years,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRoYWthdHJpYnVuZS5jb20vYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC9uYXRpb24vMjAxOS8wOC8wNy9vdmVyLTEwMC1kb2xwaGlucy1mb3VuZC1kZWFkLWluLXN1bmRhcmJhbnMtaW4tbGFzdC0xMi15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://eng-media.dhakatribune.com/?width=476&height=249&cropratio=16:9&quality=100&image=/uploads/2019/08/ganges-river-dolphin-1565121767707.jpg,2019-08-07,"{'sent': ""More than 100 shushuks (or South Asian river dolphin) and dolphins were found dead in the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, in the last 12 years.\n\n"", 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['More than 100']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"It was the smell that put off the men and women charged with converting the subcutaneous fat from freshly slaughtered elephants into ruby red beads. It was noxious. Acrid. The fumes were stomach-churning as the workers in China spent hours curing then polishing translucent beads of fat that often didn’t retain their shape.

One trader told investigators with Elephant Family, a conservation watchdog based in London, England, that it took him an entire day to produce one bead.

There was also another problem: The fat beads weren’t very durable. When they came into contact with human skin—around the neck or wrist—they would sweat.

Even so, a report out today from Elephant Family finds that the trade in elephant skins—for medicinal powders and pills and for jewelry—has mushroomed since 2018. That’s when Elephant Family and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute—the Smithsonian’s global conservation research arm—first described the commercial elephant skin trade in two separate reports. They noted that elephants were being killed and skinned in Myanmar and that the skins were sold in marketplaces and on social media platforms in China.

But now, according to the new Elephant Family report, the burgeoning industry seems to have spread from Myanmar throughout a larger swath of Southeast Asia, including not only China but also Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The beads are sold in Myanmar and China, and skin products for traditional cures in all five countries.

Elephant Family’s previous report, published in April 2018, revealed that one person appeared to be behind the bead trade, at least initially. That trader, whom they called “Jaz,” posted about beads in an online discussion board in 2014; it “generated 23 follow-up responses indicating that the trade in elephant skin beads was novel and little-known,” according to the report. The elephant beads are made in the style of traditional Chinese collectibles, known as wenwan. Exactly who wants them remains unknown.

The new report notes that some traders said their elephant skins came from captive elephant populations in the region, not from Myanmar’s dense jungles. Managers at one family-run traditional-medicine shop said their skins came from “zoos.” Another trader said his skins came from captive elephant populations in China.

“This trade is continuing, increasing, and geographically spreading. It’s substantial,” says Dave Augeri, a biologist and head of conservation at Elephant Family.

To report on the elephant skin trade, Elephant Family conducted in-country interviews, gathered information online, and sent out undercover investigators who attempted to buy products. The investigators talked to sellers, manufacturers, poachers, and law enforcement officers. They used local dialects and colloquialisms to help mask their identities, Augeri explains.

“I laud the Elephant Family for shining an international spotlight on the issue through this report,” Christy Williams, the country director for World Wildlife Fund for Nature-Myanmar, who was not involved with the report, said in an email. “What stands out is what we predicted—the trade is now spreading to other countries, which is extremely worrying.”

Deadly trade

Last March, the Smithsonian team described the toll of this industry in the journal PLOS One: Seven of the 19 collared elephants they’d been tracking in a mountainous area of Myanmar were poached within a year of being fitted with GPS collars. When researchers went to investigate, they found that at least 19 elephants—including the seven with satellite-tracking collars—had died or disappeared within about a 20-square-mile area. The deaths all occurred in less than two years, they said. In addition, 40 more elephants from surrounding areas across south-central Myanmar soon increased that tally.

For elephant skin products, poachers target adults and calves alike—a blow to Asian elephants. Their lack of tusks has allowed them to fare better than African elephants, poached at alarming rates for the global ivory market. (Among Asian Elephants, only males can grow tusks, and very few of them actually develop them.)

About 50,000 Asian elephants remain in the wild, less than a tenth the estimated number of African elephants. The number of non-captive elephants in Myanmar is low—fewer than 2,000 roaming the country’s thick forests. Lately, local authorities have been stepping up their patrols to protect these last holdouts from poachers. Indeed, Elephant Family cites information from the Myanmar government reporting that fewer elephants—18—were poached in 2018, eight fewer than the year before.

But, Augeri says, “a one-year decline may not indicate a continual decrease.” It could be a blip, and we don’t know if it will increase again, particularly with the growing online sales of these products.

Commercial exploitation of elephant skins isn’t entirely new. The wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic reported that as far back as 2006 that small quantities of elephant powder to be rubbed onto a person’s skin to help treat rashes and other conditions were sold openly in markets in Mong La, a Myanmar town on the border with China. But the trade has intensified since 2014, when elephant skin jewelry first came on the market.

Elephant Family explains that elephants targeted for the skin trade are typically killed with poisoned arrows and die a slow, painful death as the fatal substance—likely made from pesticides or plants—floods the body and drives the dying animal, in desperation, to seek water. Carcasses often are found near or in water (potentially contaminating villagers’ supplies).

Elephant skin traders selling powders or beads appear to have moved almost all their wares online, perhaps partly because Chinese authorities have cracked down and sellers have become more wary, Elephant Family says. Their investigators were told that there had been enforcement raids in China just six months after the publication of their earlier report and that shopkeepers either didn’t have skin products in stock or were unwilling to show them to unfamiliar buyers.

The Elephant Family investigation tallied at least a hundred online elephant skin traders—including suppliers, skin bead manufacturers, and skin powder producers—who advertise across 27 forums using more than 200 accounts.

The researchers also found that sellers have expanded their promotional efforts from China’s popular online platforms such as WeChat and Baidu to Facebook groups connected to Laos, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Myanmar, Augeri says.

Pangolin-elephant powder

The powder trade appears to be much larger than the bead trade, in part because it’s easier to avoid detection with beads, Augeri says. “You can always claim the powder is made from a legal species,” such as certain plants.

Elephant Family’s undercover work also found that traditional medicine sellers have recently started selling elephant skin powder that they say is mixed with powder made from pangolin scales—a troubling trend, if confirmed, since pangolins are already believed to be the world’s most trafficked nonhuman mammal. It’s possible that millions of pangolins are killed each year.

The report describes how one shop sold pills consisting primarily of elephant skin but also ground pangolin scales, labeled as “ancient recipe for stomach ailments.” An investigator saw a customer come in and buy some. (Elephant Family did not test the substances to verify what animals were used in the mix.)

Williams says that so far the World Wildlife Fund for Nature-Myanmar has not observed the same trend. “We’ve seen evidence of pangolin powder, but not as yet seen a mixture of pangolin and elephant skin.”

Elephant Family’s findings come ahead of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) conference that begins August 17 in Geneva, Switzerland. There, the status of the African elephant will be a major discussion point for the 183 parties to the treaty, with countries considering a number of proposals that could affect the extent to which ivory sales are allowed. No proposals have been submitted specifically relating to the skin trade; however a larger discussion about the threat posed by the illegal trade in Asian elephant parts—including skin—is on the agenda. Still, Williams says, “This report will draw international attention to the issue. Going forward we need to ensure there is a specific proposal on the skinning threat.”

The activities will go from 8 a.m. through 10 a.m. in the Expedition Tanzania Area.

Reid Park Zoo is encouraging the community to come out and celebrate with Nandi.

“We are celebrating her life and birthday, but we are also celebrating the lives of wild elephant herds too,” says Sue Tygielski, PhD, Director of Zoo Operations.

Reid Park Zoo says Nandi has learned many skills and the zoo wants to commemorate those accomplishments with activities for both her and the guests.

Scheduled activities:

8:10 a.m. – Free birthday cupcakes for the first 100 guests

8:15 a.m. – African drumming and dancing presented by African Diaspora Showcase

8:30 a.m. – Sing “Happy Birthday” to Nandi and watch her receive her favorite treats

8:45 a.m. - Elephant dance performance by African Diaspora Showcase

9:00 a.m. – Elephant-themed activities and keeper chats

While this will be a celebration for Nandi, the zoo wants to remind and educate everyone about poaching, habitat loss and human conflict. Elephants are vulnerable species and there are actions that can be taken at home, like not purchasing ivory. says Tygielski.

The zoo will demonstrate how they care for Nandi and the other elephants.

The birthday celebration is free with zoo admission. Adults are $10.50, seniors are $8.50, and children are $6.50.

Anyone can visit the website for a live stream of the elephants herds.

Before the vote at committee stage, EU representatives spoke out against the proposed ban, telling delegates they would oppose it.

A technical glitch prevented the bloc from voting then, but the bloc is widely expected to attempt to overturn the ban in full session next week.

Representing 28 countries including the UK, the EU vote carries great weight in shaping the rules of Cites, which is the world’s watchdog for wildlife trade.

Asked by The Independent why it opposes a ban the EU has yet to respond.

It is thought to be under pressure from the continent’s zoos that want to continue to import elephants to attract visitors.

Between 1990 and 2015, at least 1,774 wild African elephants were reported to have been exported for captive use, wildlife charity the Born Free Foundation says.

Secretive operations in the bush to capture baby elephants are thought to be carried out by teams of men in helicopters who chase the youngsters, forcibly separating them from their mothers, before tranquillising them.

Since 2012, China has imported more than 100 from Zimbabwe to keep in zoos and circuses. They are said to sell for up to $90,000 (£73,600) each.

“Video footage suggests that most were dependent calves aged between two and four, and a number have since been filmed displaying stress-induced behaviours,” according to the Born Free Foundation.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the African Elephant Coalition nations also oppose the trade.

Without a ban, African elephants from Zimbabwe and Botswana may still be sent to destinations described by Cites rules as “appropriate and acceptable”.

Born Free, which branded the trade barbaric, said elephant families would continue to be ripped apart, and baby elephants “condemned to a lifetime of suffering in captivity” by the EU’s “shocking and shameful” decision.

Chief executive Howard Jones said: “We face a knife-edge decision on the future security of African elephants and the rights of elephant families not to be hunted, or mothers killed while their babies are kidnapped for live trade to captivity in China, Russia and any other country prepared to pay. It can’t be right, it isn’t right, now or ever, and the people of Europe must speak out against this horror and pull their leaders back from the edge.”

Under a ban, trade in elephants would be limited to “conservation programmes or secure areas in the wild within the species’ natural range”, except for temporary transfers in emergencies.

A letter to EU officials from six wildlife organisations says: “Elephants are social and emotional creatures who form strong family bonds and suffer tremendously in captivity. Captured elephants can face horrific abuse during the capture process. Footage of wild-caught baby elephants awaiting export from Zimbabwe shows calves being beaten and kicked during capture.

“Some elephants have died during transit or shortly after arrival.”

Humane Society International/Africa said the loss of captured individuals caused psychological trauma for both the captured animal and its family.

However, for the first time giraffes have been given protection from unregulated trade in a vote described as a “big win”.

0,"Yesterday at the 18th triennial meeting of an international wildlife trade treaty, countries approved a proposal that limits the export of wild African elephants. It says that elephants from Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa can only be exported to African countries where elephants live or used to live. There’s one exception: Export may be allowed if a country can prove that there’s a real conservation benefit to sending an elephant elsewhere.

The proposal proved to be one of the most contentious topics of the entire two-week meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), in which 182 countries and the European Union gathered to discuss trade regulations. (Learn more: Read about other big decisions from the conference.)

Animal welfare groups and many conservation organizations lauded the decision, although some southern African countries objected vehemently, and the U.S. and a European zoo association expressed reservations.

“It’s a huge victory for animal welfare that the abduction of baby elephants from their families to be held in zoos has been banned,” says Frank Pope, CEO of the Nairobi-based nonprofit Save the Elephants. Many other animal welfare and conservation organizations echoed these sentiments.

The capture and sale of live elephants has come under increasing criticism as scientists have learned more about the complexities of elephant behavior and intellect. Elephants often refuse to leave their sick or dying behind. They’re smart, social creatures with family bonds that last a lifetime. And in recent years, evidence has stacked up that they use tools, work together to achieve common goals, mourn their dead, and are capable of empathy. During certain times of the year African savanna elephants are highly gregarious, with hundreds gathering together.

Taken together, those facts make it particularly troubling to many scientists and animal welfare groups when elephants, often young ones, are separated from their families in the wild to be sold to zoos.

“Like us, elephants feel joy when reunited with family and grief when brutally separated. Like us, they need friends and space to thrive. The physical and psychological harm caused to individual elephants by their traumatic capture and their impoverished lives in captivity is well-documented,” says Joyce Poole, an elephant behavior expert and National Geographic Explorer. Young elephants are particularly vulnerable. Family separation can cause psychological trauma, resulting in conditions that include depression, anxiety, aggression, and, sometimes, premature death.

A few southern African countries—notably Zimbabwe, which has an estimated 82,000 elephants, and Botswana, with some 130,000—say they’re increasingly faced with two problems that require such sales: keeping these wild animals away from humans and their lands, where they can destroy crops and kill people, and offsetting the costs of conservation by profiting from the nations’ wildlife.

A solution, those countries argue, is to sell elephants to zoos around the world. Zimbabwe, for example, has made a recent habit of selling calves to China, and Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) shipped 17 of its elephants to U.S. zoos in 2016, saying they would have been culled otherwise.

The shipment of mostly young wild elephants from Africa is a relatively new phenomenon. Before the mid-1990s, calves typically were captured only as a by-product of adult culling operations, according to documents submitted to CITES.

Chinese zoos, for example, have imported more than a hundred young elephants from Zimbabwe since 2012, according to Humane Society International. The imports have drawn international condemnation from that group and other animal welfare advocates. Zimbabwe officials say their country should be allowed to manage its wildlife as it likes.

“Exceptional circumstances”

Yesterday during debate, the EU suggested that the proposal be amended to allow the export of elephants beyond range states in “exceptional circumstances.” That would require demonstrating that the transfer of those elephants provides conservation benefits to the species. Elephant expert groups at CITES and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which sets the conservation status of species, would need to be convinced of the benefits for approval to be granted.

The United States voted against the amended proposal. A spokeswoman for the U.S. delegation to CITES, Barbara Wainman, told National Geographic that the U.S. rejects any limitations on where elephants can be sent that are based on geography, rather than “on suitability of a facility being equipped to house and care for elephants.”

Wainman said that the U.S. stance is that a different provision of the treaty adequately lays out the science-based approach for decisions about where to send elephants. She said that further provisions aren’t needed to define what destinations are “appropriate and acceptable.”

Meanwhile, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) said in a statement, “EAZA welcomes the practical outcome of the vote, which will prevent the import of wild caught elephants to inappropriate destinations.” But EAZA expressed concern that the new restrictions could undermine the CITES regulatory framework by treating elephants that are in a category with less stringent protections from international trade (such as those in Botswana and Zimbabwe) as essentially equivalent to elephants that have been given the highest level of protection.

It’s unclear whether this decision will have any impact on U.S. zoos’ ability to import elephants. Dan Ashe, president and CEO of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which accredits 236 facilities in the U.S., says that having elephants in zoos supports the animals’ conservation beyond the funds that zoos contribute for their conservation in the wild. “Does it benefit elephants to have a public aware of what is happening?” he says. “It’s absolutely essential to conservation of wildlife that people…have an emotional connection and feel empathy for animals.” Seeing them in well managed zoos creates that connection and understanding of their status in the wild, Ashe says.

Elephants are a draw for the zoo-going public, but the IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group has long expressed concern about “the poor breeding success and low life expectancy of captive African elephants.” Zoos, therefore, sometimes look abroad to add elephants to their facilities.

“Merely sending a wild elephant to a zoo doesn't meet this requirement” of having a conservation benefit, notes Colman Criodain, a wildlife practice policy manager at the World Wildlife Fund. The IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group also holds this view. The key, Criodain says, will be how zoos demonstrate the benefit.

The IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group also says it doesn’t believe there’s any conservation benefit for wild elephants taken into captivity and “does not endorse the removal of African elephants from the wild for any captive use.” This seems to imply that the IUCN will set a high standard for what constitutes “exceptional circumstances.”

Mark Jones, the head of policy for the United Kingdom-based Born Free Foundation, a group that opposes taking any animals from the wild, says of yesterday’s vote, “This outcome may not be perfect and watertight, but it is an outcome that sets a strong precedent and takes us much further down the road toward permanently ending the taking of elephants from the wild for captive facilities.”

Moreover, he says, it’s concerning that the new determination applies only to elephants that don’t have the most stringent CITES trade protections. Countries with elephant populations at particular risk of extinction, such as Eswatini, which shipped 17 elephants to three U.S. zoos in 2016, wouldn’t be covered and potentially could still make a case to export elephants.

When introducing the amended proposal, the European Union said that it hasn’t imported any live elephants during the past decade and has no intention of doing so in future. During the debate, China didn’t indicate its future intentions. Neither did the United States.",African elephants can't be caught in the wild and sent to faraway zoos anymore,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vYW5pbWFscy8yMDE5LzA4L3dpbGQtYmFieS1lbGVwaGFudHMtem9vLWJhbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2019/08/cites/baby-captive-elephants/01-baby-elephants-captive-nationalgeographic_2301360.ngsversion.1567022439416.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2019-08-28,"{'sent': 'It says that elephants from Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa can only be exported to African countries where elephants live or used to live.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Namibia', 'Botswana', 'South Africa', 'Zimbabwe']}}",Elephant

A South West safari park is mourning the death of its second Siberian tiger this year.

Soundari, the oldest tigress at Longleat, died aged 13 after a long fight with cancer.

A spokesman for the park said: ""It is with deep sadness that we announce the death of our oldest female tiger, Soundari, who has passed away following a long battle with cancer.

""Soundari was a spectacular individual and will be sadly missed by everyone at the park.""

Soundari had become a minor celebrity after winning a 'fight' with a snowman setup during the snow last year, Bristol Live reports .

She was one of three tigers to arrive at the park in 2006 when she was brought in along with sisters Svetli and Shouri.

But last year, Svetli died from a heart attack during a routine medical procedure at the age of 11.

Then, in February this year, Shouri was killed when she was accidentally let in to another enclosure with two other tigers.

The ensuing fight with Amur tigers Red and Yana saw the 13-year-old succumb to her injuries.

At the time, Longleat said the killing had left staff “extremely distraught” and added that it wants “to determine the exact circumstances surrounding this terribly sad event”.

In July, the park announced that Red and Yana had given birth to two cubs - the first at the park in nearly two decades.

Mum Yana and dad Red are four years old and have been at Longleat for just over a year, having come from separate collections in Sweden and Norway.

The pair are part of a European breeding programme for the endangered sub-species.

Speaking after the births, keeper Caleb Hall said: “Yana and Red are first-time parents and we’re extremely pleased with how well they are reacting to the new arrivals.""

0,"The Milwaukee County Zoo will add a third African elephant to its herd.

Belle is being transferred from the Riverbanks Zoo and Garden in South Carolina to join long-time residents Ruth and Brittany. The addition fills the zoo's requirement by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' new guidelines to hold a minimum of three elephants. It also gives Belle a place to retire.

""Elephants are very social animals so having some companionship is very important for their psychological well-being and health,"" said Gary Lunsford, the zoo’s director of animal management and health.

Until recently, the Milwaukee County Zoo didn't have the space for three elephants. In May, the zoo opened its Adventure Africa Exhibit, which is large enough to accommodate five elephants.

The $16.6 million, 1.6-acre outdoor habitat features a watering hole able to accommodate three fully-submerged elephants, feeding and enrichment walls, shade structures and self-activating shower.

""We are excited at just the thought of more elephants in the new exhibit, and are anxious for Belle to join Ruth and Brittany,"" said zoo director Chuck Wikenhauser.

Sign up for daily news! Stay informed with WPR's email newsletter.

All three of the elephants are 38 years old. Lundsford said the average life span in captivity is 38.6 years. However, some elephants can live to be up to 50 years old.

""If we were to find a younger female to go in with our girls, we would certainly consider that option,"" Lundsford said. ""With our older females we have here, we figure that is a really great way to specialize.""

There are no current plans to add a male elephant at the zoo, Lundsford said.

Belle is being transferred because her current zoo is preparing for the re-introduction of southern white rhinoceros to its population and there is no longer room for her.

""The Milwaukee County Zoo was the right option and the right decision for Belle’s needs, to thrive and live out her life,"" Wikenhauser said.

""We know how to take care of elephants that are getting along in age, and I think that’s a real service we can provide to these animals, and a responsibility we don’t take lightly,"" said Wikenhauser.

Detroit Zoo has introduced the new Devereaux Tiger Forest and welcomed Amur tigers Nikolai and Aleksei, 2-year-old brothers who were born at the Columbus Zoo.

The habitat is also home to 16-year-old female Kisa, who was born at the Detroit Zoo. The renovated and expanded habitat was made possible in part by a $1-million gift from the Richard C. Devereaux Foundation.

The $3.5-million habitat occupies 1 acre in the Detroit Zoo’s Asian Forest across from the Holtzman Wildlife Foundation Red Panda Forest. The space has been reimagined to closely mirror the tigers’ native landscape of far eastern Russia with naturalistic elements important to tigers, including elevated vantage points, open spaces, wooded areas, pools, a waterfall and a “catnap” cave.

The expansion has quadrupled the size of the former habitat and offers multiple observation areas for guests, including expansive views through 85 feet of acrylic windows and soaring vistas from the canopy walkway over the red panda habitat. A Land Rover intersects the acrylic window, with its hood inside the tiger habitat and the driver’s side in the public area, providing opportunities for close-up views – and amazing photo opportunities – of the tigers when they lounge on the hood of the vehicle, which will be heated in the winter.

“We have no doubt the Devereaux Tiger Forest will be very popular with visitors, especially with the incredible vantage points, and we’re sure the tigers will enjoy their new digs with more room to prowl and play,” said Ron Kagan, executive director and CEO for the Detroit Zoological Society (DZS).

The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), formerly known as the Siberian tiger, is the largest member of the big cat family and the largest of the five remaining subspecies of tiger. On average, they can grow to 10 feet long and 3 to 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh up to 650 pounds. Nikolai currently weighs 365 pounds; Aleksei tips the scales at 335 pounds.

The Amur tiger is listed as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature; it is estimated there are only around 500 remaining in the wild due to threats such as poaching, habitat loss and disease.

The Devereaux Tiger Forest was designed by DZS staff with Jones & Jones – architects of the Detroit Zoo's Polk Penguin Conservation Center, Arctic Ring of Life and National Amphibian Conservation Center – and the two-year construction project was done by the Albert M. Higley Company.

In addition to the Devereaux Foundation's lead gift for the tiger habitat, support was also provided by the DeRoy Testamentary Foundation and many individual donors, as well as contributions from the 2017 ""Giving Zoo Day"" fundraising campaign and proceeds from this year's Sunset at the Zoo ""Asian Forest"" gala.

The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), formerly known as the Siberian tiger, is the largest member of the big cat family and the largest of the five remaining subspecies of tiger. On average, they can grow to 10 feet long and 3 to 4 feet tall at the shoulder and weigh up to 650 pounds. Nikolai currently weighs 365 pounds; Aleksei tips the scales at 335 pounds.

The Amur tiger is listed as Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature; it is estimated there are only around 500 remaining in the wild due to threats such as poaching, habitat loss and disease.

""We hope that by seeing tigers here at the Detroit Zoo, people will be inspired to learn more about their conservation in the wild and feel empowered to take action to help save them,"" Kagan said.

0,"NGT has directed the state authorities of Madhya Pradesh to take effective steps for the conservation of the Son Gharial Wildlife Sanctuary in the Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh and submit the report in three weeks.



A plea was filed by one Nityanand Mishra in 2014 for the protection of Gharial population from the unregulated sand mining in the in the area of 200 km stretch of Son River, which is where the Gharial sanctuary lies. Nityanand's application showed that the enforcement staff of the Forest Department had failed to check the same, relying upon the photographs and RTI information to show that no sanction was granted for the sand mining.

The Bench while hearing the plea had observed that according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature's (IUCN) data, the Gharial population declined by a whopping 96-98%, and the Indian government had also listed it as Protected species by wildlife protection act 1972. The concerned state authorities, including the M.P. Pollution Control Board, had however denied any adverse impact on the water quality of River Son.

After considering the various proceedings that took place over 4 years, since 2014, the Bench was of the view that 'strong continuous measures' were necessary for the protection of the endangered species. To ensure the conservation of Gharials, the NGT, Central Zone Bench had directed the constitution of a Committee consisting of representatives from Indian Institute of Forest Management, Bhopal, Wildlife Institute, Dehradun, Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad, and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF & CC). the Committee was given the task of preparing an action plan for the object of checking illegal mining in the son Gharial Sanctuary, in order to ensure the conservation of the endangered Gharials.

The Green Tribunal, Central Zone Bench, asked the Committee to submit its report to the Tribunal after three months of working, and directed the District Administration to provide adequate police force to check illegal mining and protection of the wildlife in the area of the sanctuary. The application was thus, disposed of on 31.07.2018, with the orders to consider the Committee's report in February 2019.

When the report came up for consideration, the Bench headed by Justice Raghuvendra S. Rathore, JM observed that the report was however submitted by the Committee in February 2019, as opposed to the expected time frame of October 2018, as had been directed by the Tribunal in its july 31st order. Even so, the NGT, Central Zone Bench observed that the report was expected to give progress in respect of the action taken in respect of the illegal mining activity, and not simply file a status report of the work to be done by the various departments. The Bench held that such a status report did not give any clarification as to the action taken so far, and what remained to be done.

In view of the aforesaid developments, the Tribunal has directed that the Madhya Pradesh State Government to ensure that all the related departments mentioned in the report of the Committee, filed their separate progress reports. These reports must show the steps taken to execute the action plan, and must be submitted within 3 weeks.

The matter will now be heard on 10th October, 2019. The NGT Bench has also directed the Chief Wildlife Warden, Government of Madhya Pradesh to remain present for the next hearing.

0,"Tiger DNA expert Uma Ramakrishnan gets special permission to wander India’s protected forests on foot, following the same trails the big cats tread. While she enjoys coming across tigers and their cubs and watching them with binoculars, those sightings aren’t the treasure she’s after. What she loves most is to find tiger droppings — “almost like gold to me,” says the molecular ecologist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore.

Territorial tigers oblige by leaving scat regularly, as a warning to other tigers that this space is occupied. These nuggets contain genetic material that scientists like Ramakrishnan use to understand tiger populations: How many are there, and what kinds? Where did they come from, and how far do they travel?

It’s crucial information for conservation efforts. Tigers are endangered, with fewer than 4,000 wild ones roaming the lands of at least 10 nations, from Eastern Russia to the island of Sumatra. That’s down from an estimate of 100,000 in 1900. Human activity such as urban development, logging, farming and mining has fragmented and destroyed tigers’ forest habitats, and poaching is an ongoing problem in parts of Southeast Asia.

“If you’re going to have conservation management, you have to know what you’re dealing with,” says Stephen O’Brien, a geneticist at St. Petersburg State University in Russia and Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. For example, genetic studies show that tigers are split into several subspecies, so conservationists may want to develop strategies to protect each group.

Over the past two decades, scientists have built up a picture of tiger evolution and ecology based on their DNA, as described this year in the Annual Review of Animal Biosciences. Early on, scientists could only look at a handful of spots in the tiger genome. Today, with the advent of inexpensive DNA sequencing and genomics that covers every bit of the instructions to make a tiger, experts are gaining a much broader picture of tiger biodiversity.

DNA analysis — which will help not just to save tigers, but also to preserve the range of genetic variety that they carry — “is one of the best tools we have,” says Byron Weckworth, conservation genetics director for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization in Missoula, Montana. That said, he adds, the application of genomic information to conservation is still in its infancy.

Here are some of the key questions that tiger genomes can answer.

How many tigers are there?

The nature of wild tigers — solitary, well-camouflaged and rare — makes it difficult to conduct a census. To that end, Ramakrishnan evaluated the potential of genetics to count tigers for a 2009 study in Biological Conservation. She and her colleagues collected 68 samples of tiger dung from Bandipur Tiger Reserve and National Park in the south of India, preserving them in alcohol. Back in the lab, they isolated the DNA inside to examine the genetic sequences — the strings of letters A, C, G and T — of certain parts of the tiger genome.

If a genome is like a book, most of the words will be identical from tiger to tiger. What geneticists look for are the places where the words can differ. Specifically, Ramakrishnan and colleagues analyzed places where the tiger genome repeats itself, and stutters — say, GATA-GATA-GATA-GATA-GATA. No two tigers have the same number of repeats at each spot, so scientists can use the differing counts to distinguish individuals.

The researchers got high-quality data from 38 of their scat samples, and together these represented 26 individuals. That is, some tigers had left Ramakrishnan multiple presents. By number-crunching the tigers appearing once or multiple times in these samples, she estimated that there were 66 tigers in the area.

Ramakrishnan updated the technique in an April 2019 study, this time using modern technology to read every letter in the genomes of 75 wild and captive tiger samples. Her team tested for even subtler genetic changes than the numbers of repeats, homing in on variations in the spellings of individual words — say, a place that had a CAA instead of a CAT. From this, the researchers devised a panel of 126 spelling variations that help to identify individuals, reporting their work in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

The new test is fast, easy and inexpensive, Ramakrishnan says. She hopes that it will make tiger-typing (and tiger-counting) accessible to scientists in all nations that host the creatures. That’s important because, due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), researchers cannot send any tiger samples across borders.

What kinds of tigers are there?

Tigers are known as Panthera tigris to scientists, but there’s more to it than that. They can be divided into subspecies: groups that are isolated and might, over time, develop into new species, O’Brien says.

“It’s better to save tigers as a whole, but in doing that, we should be saving the subspecies wherever we can,” says John Goodrich, tiger program senior director and chief scientist for Panthera in Fort Collins, Colorado. Plus, Goodrich notes, regional governments are more likely to fund tiger conservation if they have a flagship subspecies of their own.

But how many subspecies are there to save? Estimates have ranged from just two to as many as nine (of which three are already extinct). Genomics can help.

Geneticist Shu-Jin Luo at Peking University in Beijing and colleagues sequenced the genomes of 32 samples of tiger blood and tissue. When they compared the millions of differing genetic spellings and built a tiger family tree, they found that living tigers fell into six distinct groups, described in a 2018 paper in Current Biology: Bengal tigers in India, Amur tigers in Eastern Russia, and South China, Sumatran, Indochinese and Malayan varieties.

“It has major implications on how we do conservation,” says study coauthor Dale Miquelle, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Russia program and coordinator for the society’s tiger projects. For example, zoos breed animals to keep subspecies bloodlines pure. One day, says Miquelle, conservationists might return some of those animals to the wild, infusing natural tiger populations with diverse genes that exist only in captives today.

In places where tigers roam no more, it might be feasible to introduce animals that genomics identify as most related to the extinct populations, suggests O’Brien, also a coauthor of the study. For example, Amur tigers are a close match for the extinct Caspian subspecies.

How have tigers changed over time?

Fossils indicate that tigers roamed China and Java 2 million years ago. Based on their tiger family tree, Luo’s group predicts that between 1 million and 110,000 years ago, tiger populations contracted into a small group, located in modern-day China and Southeast Asia. This was probably the result of the cool climate at the time, a feature of the Earth’s most recent ice age.

From this small group sprang all modern tigers, which spread across much of Asia. They developed genes best suited to their lifestyles in locales ranging from the tropics to the tundra.

For example, Sumatran tigers are smaller than others. They range from 165 to 308 pounds, compared to about 550 for Bengals, the biggest subspecies. Miniaturization is a common island adaptation for large animals, says Yue-Chen Liu, a geneticist who recently earned a PhD in Luo’s lab and plans to start work at Harvard University soon. Tigers may have encountered smaller prey when they reached the island of Sumatra, and through evolution, shrank to match.

Size is controlled by many genes, so Liu was surprised to find one in particular that might control Sumatran tigers’ size. The animals differ from other tigers in a gene for a protein — called ADH7 — that affects metabolism. Mice with mutations in this gene are small; the same might have happened in the tigers.

It’s just this kind of genetic diversity that conservationists ought to protect, says Liu.

Where does poached or illegally traded tiger material come from?

These endangered beasts are victims of their own majesty, as practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe their body parts are powerful restoratives, and others purchase the gorgeous pelts for decoration. One estimate valued the tiger-poaching industry at $19 billion per year. Unpermitted transport of tigers or their parts from one country to another is a crime, so identifying the source of the material can help prosecutors.

Luo’s group developed a test they call tigrisPlex. It uses 22 genetic repeat sequences to identify tiger subspecies and individuals. Reporting in the journal Integrative Zoology in 2015, they used the test to identify 12 confiscated skin or muscle specimens as being from six Amur tigers.

TigrisPlex can also help zoos maintain subspecies. In 2013, Luo got a call from a zoo in Osaka, Japan. The zoo was thinking of importing a tiger cub from China, but wanted to pick one that would be a good fit for the Amur tiger population they already had. Luo confirmed that the cub was an Amur, and that tiger is now living — happily, Luo is told — in Osaka.

How do tigers travel?

Since tigers maintain solitary territories, young animals leaving their mothers must find a new place to live. Individual tigers may travel more than 600 miles.

That’s difficult if tigers live mainly in protected parks, and human towns or roads get in the way of migration between their havens. To study tiger transit, Ramakrishnan’s group collected 289 tiger scat samples from 11 Indian parks, as well as areas beyond the parks. These samples represented 116 individuals.

Based on the DNA in the scat, the researchers found that tiger populations were less likely to mix when separated by roads, human settlements or nonwild areas such as pastures. Reporting in the journal Biological Conservation in 2018, they used computer models to predict what might happen to tiger populations under this kind of isolation, and it wasn’t good: Tigers would become less diverse, and the smallest populations were likely to disappear.

Conservationists are trying to stop that from happening. For example, the National Highways Authority of India recently expanded National Highway 7, which runs between Pench Tiger Reserve and Kanha Tiger Reserve in the middle of India, from two to four lanes. Environmentalists used Ramakrishnan’s data to argue that tigers need safe crossings.

The Highways Authority ended up constructing underpasses. And there’s evidence that tigers do use them: Early in the morning of February 23, 2019, a camera trap in one underpass outside the Pench Reserve caught a tiger strolling by.

What will become of tigers?

Genomicists hope that their data will be used to perform a sort of conservation triage, identifying the subspecies and populations most in need of help, or most likely to survive with assistance.

Today, the outlook is mixed for tigers, Goodrich says. They are doing well in southern Asia, and likely in the northeast, though he doesn’t have good population estimates for eastern Russia. In Southeast Asia, poaching remains a huge problem. And climate change is causing droughts and rising waters, further endangering tiger habitats, he adds.

Miquelle is optimistic about tigers’ long-term prospects. He hopes that as human populations stabilize and people move from the countryside to cities, there will be more room for wild things like tigers.

“One hundred years from now, there could be many more tigers in Asia than there are today,” he says. “There may be light at the end of the tunnel.”",From tiger scat to DNA to — hopefully — survival,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtub3dhYmxlbWFnYXppbmUub3JnL2FydGljbGUvbGl2aW5nLXdvcmxkLzIwMTkvdGlnZXItc2NhdC1kbmEtY29uc2VydmF0aW9u0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.knowablemagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/1600_600/public/articles/341/tiger-listicle-1600x600_0.gif?itok=LAc5K0za,2019-09-17,"{'sent': 'Tiger DNA expert Uma Ramakrishnan gets special permission to wander India’s protected forests on foot, following the same trails the big cats tread.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Uma Ramakrishnan'], 'GPE': ['India']}}",Tiger

In the 1930s they nearly died out due to hunting, with numbers falling to as low as between 20 and 30.

Why are Amur tiger numbers declining so fast? Amur tigers were once found throughout the Russian Far East, northern China and the Korean peninsula but now face increasing threats to their habitat. Their forests are at risk from logging, conversion to agriculture, urban expansion, road construction, mining, fires and inadequate law enforcement. Illegal logging is widespread throughout the Russian Far East and has a major impact on tiger populations because Korean pine and Mongolian oak provide critical food for the the tigers' prey during the snow season. At least 30 per cent of all Russian forest exports are tainted by illegal logging. The United States is the top importer of hardwoods harvested in the Russian Far East and manufactured as furniture in China. In 2010, the Russian government listed Korean pine in Appendix III of CITES—requiring CITES permits for Korean pine timber exported from Russia and making it harder for the illegal timber trade to continue. Dark Forest, an undercover Russian documentary investigating the timber mafia in Russia, puts a spotlight on the high-level corruption prevalent in the system. The film highlights the prevalence of illegal deforestation in protected areas and fake auctions in the Russian Far East.

'Despite all our best efforts, we never really know how they will react until the big day.

'However Rusty and Yuki took the whole thing in their stride and seemed to relish all the new sights, sounds and smells.'

He added: 'Their playfighting and stalking games are exactly what they would be doing in the wild and signals the beginning of their independence from mum.'

The Longleat cubs are the first to be born there in almost 20 years, weighing about 2lbs each at birth.

But they are expected to grow to around 10ft in length and weigh about 660lbs (300kg).

The cubs are solely dependent on their mother for the first three months and even after that they will closely follow her and only be fully mature at three to four years.

0,"This is the second feature in a three-part series on how China's push to create a network of new national parks is impacting local communities. The series is the product of a monthslong investigation conducted by Sixth Tone in collaboration with its sister publication The Paper. The first feature in the series can be read here.

JILIN, Northeast China — Tigers are costing Zheng Hailun a fortune. The 64-year-old rents acres of pastureland on China’s northeastern border to graze his cattle, but these days he can rarely use it. He keeps his cows locked up for most of the year, spending around $25,000 on extra feed.

Zheng is not doing this to protect his animals from big cats; rather, it’s the other way around. He is one of thousands of farmers in northeastern China forced to remove their cattle from the mountains to preserve the habitats of China’s few remaining Siberian tigers.

Siberian tigers are native to Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, which border Russia and North Korea, but the species is critically endangered. Years of human encroachment has divided their hunting grounds and cut them off from tiger populations in the Russian Far East.

The Chinese government has stepped up conservation efforts to prevent the extinction of the felines, and in 2016 it announced plans to create a new national park — the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park — covering swathes of Jilin and Heilongjiang.

Within months, officials in Zheng’s hometown of Hunchun, which is within the boundaries of the park, banned farmers from grazing cattle on local mountainsides. In 2018, they introduced further rules requiring all cattle to be kept inside cowsheds between April and October each year. Anyone found allowing their animals to graze freely would be fined 500 yuan ($70) per cow.

The ban is designed to create more grazing areas for wild red deer and Sika deer — the main prey of Siberian tigers and Amur leopards — as well as prevent herders and cattle from disturbing the cats’ natural sleeping habits. But it has provoked pushback from locals, who say the rules are having a huge impact on their livelihoods.

According to Zheng, the extra costs from keeping his animals inside swallow almost all the income he can make from selling cattle. “The main loss is from the feed,” says Zheng. “A cow eats 300 yuan of feed every month, so for 100 cattle that’s 180,000 yuan over six months.”

Zheng used to simply ride his motorcycle to the pastures every other day to check on his herd, but he now spends almost all day feeding the cows and mucking out the pen. He has quickly become the busiest person in his village, unable to pursue any side ventures to supplement his income.

By the winter of 2018, the financial pressure on Hunchun’s farmers had become so great, many started selling off their animals. Zheng reduced his herd by 30, leaving around 70. He can’t bring himself to sell any more — after all, he has invested nearly 3 million yuan on cattle farming over the years.

The herders find it hard to understand why the government has suddenly restricted their industry, despite generously supporting it before. Several have released their cattle back onto the hills. According to Zheng, no one has ever been fined.

Gao Dabin, a director at the Hunchun branch of the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Parks Administration, says local officials feel helpless. “Of course this work is harmful to the interests of villagers — the problem has not been thoroughly solved,” says Gao. “It needs to be solved step by step.”

But the problems could soon become more severe. In 2018, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration released a plan to roll out further conservation methods inside the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. It says that free grazing will eventually be restricted on 95% of the land inside the park, affecting more than 60,000 cattle.

What’s more, Gao adds, restrictions on other activities will gradually be introduced one after the other — including frog farming, gathering wild vegetables, and mining, among others — all of which will impact the local economy.

For the 93,000 people living inside the park, the new rules represent the latest in a series of policies threatening their traditional way of life. Bans on hunting and logging introduced in the ’90s cut off large sources of income, leading many to seek their fortunes in nearby cities or even in South Korea. Of those left behind, those in their 40s are considered young, and most do not even have a junior high school education.

Conservation researchers argue that it should be possible for the villagers and tigers to coexist inside the national park if the government creates detailed and focused policy objectives.

Jiang Guangshun, deputy director of the Feline Research Center at Northeast Forestry University, says that efforts should concentrate on allowing China’s Siberian tigers to link up with larger cat populations in Russia. “It is very important to open up the international ecological corridor,” says Jiang.

Yet government policy documents suggest no such detailed planning is yet in place. Around four-fifths of the land in Hunchun is currently included in the proposed conservation project. If these proposals are implemented, they would severely impact traditional ways of life in the region.

A number of researchers have proposed amendments to the zoning plans, reporters have learned, but it is still unclear whether these changes have been put into effect. Zhu Chunquan, China’s representative for the International Union for Conservation of Nature, says the plan needs to be more detailed.

“The zoning should be specific to each village and each hill, clarifying which are habitats and ecological corridors,” says Zhu. “It shouldn’t just be a big circle.”

“Priority should be given to protecting habitats and diffusion routes that are higher quality,” says Gu Jiayin, one of Jiang’s colleagues at Northeast Forestry University. “Tigers are very smart and will not run to places with poor habitats.”

Researchers are keen to begin work on a more detailed protection plan. According to Wu Jingcai, a researcher at the Jilin Forestry Research Institute, there is still a lack of basic knowledge about how human activity impacts wildlife in China.

The Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park Administration told reporters that its main priority remains protecting the tigers and leopards’ habitats, and that several policies are still being formulated. But the park plans to support local residents in moving toward more eco-friendly farming methods and opening family guesthouses and other tourist venues.

Jiang says that Hunchun may not be able to rely on the mountains as much as before, but cultural tourism and other activities that have less environmental impact than cattle-farming can help make up for this loss of income. His examples include beekeeping, fruit-gathering, and cultural exhibitions highlighting the region’s Korean heritage.

“It’s not easy for the community to understand the value of protecting the Siberian tiger, because that means changing their own lives,” says Fan Zhiyong, chief scientist at the World Wide Fund for Nature. “Don’t be too hard on them.”

Around 163 melon-headed dolphins were found washed up on the island of Boa Vista by locals and tourists.

Hundreds of volunteers tried to drag them all back into the ocean.

However, lots of the marine mammals decided to swim back to shore where they ultimately died.

Less than 20% of the struggling pod survived.

Bulldozers have now buried 136 dolphins that died but experts are still struggling to work out what caused this suicidal behaviour.

BIOS Cape Verde, a volunteer environmental association, wrote on Facebook: ""To determine the cause of this phenomenon, veterinarians from the Institute of Animal Health (IUSA) of the University of Las Palmas, Gran Canarias, will travel to Boa Vista in the coming weeks to perform a necropsy, which will also serve to train local technicians in the subject.""

Samples have been taken from 50 of the dolphins and four of the carcasses have been frozen.

These samples should help to aid in the researchers in determining the health of the creatures.

There can be several reasons why sea creatures strand themselves.

Potential factors include weather conditions, diseases, parasites, magnetic field anomalies, underwater noise, seaquakes and unfamiliar waters.

Dolphin facts Here's what you need to know about the cute creatures... Dolphins are small toothed aquatic mammals and there are currently almost 40 different species of them

There are 36 dolphin species, which can be found in every ocean but there are a few of them that live in freshwater streams and rivers like the South Asian river dolphin and the Amazon river dolphin

Despite their name, Killer Whales are actually the largest kind of dolphin and can grow up to 30 feet long

Sometimes Killer Whales prey upon other dolphins

Common dolphins mostly eat fish and squid

They use echolocation to navigate the ocean and find prey, which involves creating sound waves to bounce off objects so they can work out things like size and distance

An echolocating dolphin can make up to 1,000 clicking noises per second

They are very sociable, playful animals and are constantly commincating with each other

They normally live in pods of around 12 but can form a 'megapod' with other nearby dolphins in rare situations, such as if they are avoiding predators

We don't know for certain how long the average dolphin lifespan is but female bottlenose dolphins have been known to live for more than 60 years and females tend to outlive males

Dolphins can reach speeds of more than 18 miles an hour and often like to swim alongside boats

0,"SYRACUSE, N.Y. — Toma, a male Amur tiger at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo, has died at age 18, the zoo announced Tuesday in a Facebook post.

Toma was the oldest living male Amur tiger in human care and had previously survived cancer treatment, the Syracuse zoo said.

Toma is survived by his mate, Tatiana, a nearly 20-year-old Amur tiger. The pair had triplet cubs at the zoo in 2011 as part of the species survival plan for their “critically endangered species,” according to the Facebook post. The three cubs were sent to zoos in South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, respectively, as part of the plan.

On Wednesday, Sept. 18, Toma showed increasing signs of severe abdominal pain, according to the zoo. A veterinary team from the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine that practices at the zoo was quickly mobilized, anesthetizing and examining the tiger. Test results suggested peritonitis and a perforation of the GI tract, according to the Facebook post. Due to the severity of his condition, zoo animal-care specialists and the Cornell vet team decided to “humanely euthanize him.”

Results from a necropsy confirmed that Toma had “a perforation of the small intestine directly associated with a large mass suspected to be cancer,” the zoo said.

Formerly called Siberian tigers, Amur tigers once ranged throughout Siberia but now inhabit only the Amur River basin in Far East Russia, the zoo explained. The largest species of wild cat, their population has been “decimated by human poaching and habitat loss,” leaving fewer than 400 of the tigers estimated to remain in the wild.

Ted Fox, Rosamond Gifford Zoo director, said the zoo will acquire another pair of Amur tigers and continue to participate in the species survival plan in the future.

A one-day workshop was organized by the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) in collaboration with WII and WWF-India today for developing a charter that aims for enhancing the population of Ganges River Dolphin by 2030. The workshop, with more than 100 attendees, included participants from all SMCGs, Forest Departments, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Climate Change (MoEF & CC), NGOs, Ganga ‘Mitras’ & ‘Praharis’ (volunteers), media and technical experts from Patna University, Vikramshila, WII and IITs.

Today, the total population of the Gangetic Dolphin stands between 2500 to 3000, out of which more than 80% inhabit the Ganga and its tributaries. Government of India had declared the Ganga River Dolphin ‘the National Aquatic Animal’ in the first meeting of the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA) on October 5, 2009.

DG NMCG today said that based on the consultation, a charter will be developed to enhance the population of the Gangetic Dolphin. “NMCG has been relentlessly working for the conservation and protection of the species and giving its due support to the Ministry of Environment and Forest, and Climate Change, to develop robust Dolphin Actin Plans over the years. We will develop enabling policies for the integration of Dolphin conservation at State and national level,’’he said.

Ravi Singh, SG & CEO, WWF said,“We have lost Yangtze River Dolphin species which was found in the river in China and we should focus on protecting out remaining dolphin species including Ganga River Dolphins and Indus River Dolphins in India. We need to have models similar to Conservation Assured | Tiger Standard (CA|TS) for conservation of River Dolphins.”.

Dr. S.A Hussain, Scientist G, WII highlighted action points that needs to be taken as priority, which are initiate state wise population surveys, setting up of Pas/reserve for dolphins, develop capacity of stakeholders, involve local communities in dolphin conservation and conduct education and awareness programs. The consultation also looked at issues including establishing baselines and setting goals with the objective on agreeing on methodology or methodologies for Dolphin census across states in India, securing Dolphin habitats for establishing thresholds of river flows and quality in critical dolphin habitats and, potential gains for Dolphin Conservation through developing Conservation Assured Standards and community led conservation for identifying enablers needed to mainstream the good practices in community led conservation.

The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) organised a 1-day workshop on Saturday, in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and the Indian wing of World Wildlife Fund (WWF-India). The workshop was aimed at developing a charter that aims to enhance the population of the Ganges River Dolphin by 2030. The National Aquatic Animal of India, River Dolphin’s main habitat is the freshwater of the Ganga river and its tributaries. A government source states that the ‘River dolphin’ is a critically endangered species in the country. It has been included in the Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.

A report published in the Indian Express suggested that the total population of the Gangetic Dolphin ranges between 2,500-3,000. As much as 80 per cent of this population inhabits on the Ganga and its tributaries. The report citing the Director-General of the NMCG informed that the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) has been working relentlessly towards the conservation and protection of the endangered species. According to the report the government body has said that they will be developing enabling policies for the integration of conservation of River Dolphins at both State and national level.

The SG and CEO of WWF-India, Ravi Singh told IE that they have lost the Yangtze River Dolphin species found in China. He further told the daily that the main focus should be aimed at protecting the remaining dolphin species in India including the Ganga River Dolphins and Indus River Dolphins.”

Notably, the National Aquatic Animal of India, ‘River Dolphin’ inhabits parts of the Ganges, Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers.

Amidst, rising global concerns in regard to climate change and the need to take actions to preserve our climate and battle pollution, the government has taken several actions in recent months over the need to be aware and alert about our flora and fauna. Prime Minister has been talking about the severeness of climate change and has urged people to eliminate single-use plastic from daily usage.

It is a well-known fact that the pollution in Ganga is adversely hampering its quality of water and making aquatic life suffer. Experts believe that in order to enhance the quality of water and help aquatic life thrive, government’s spreading awareness to keep the river clean is not enough and strict measures against those violating rules should be worked upon.","How to increase Ganges dolphin population?

0,"Eight of Africa’s remaining 30 “big tuskers” live in South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park.

The park is set to be expanded by up to 26,000 hectares, allowing its herd of 200 to grow.

The park is owned and managed by local communities.

DURBAN, South Africa — There is a scene at the start of the film Last of the Big Tuskers where a man is having his upper arm tattooed.

As the artist puts the finishing touches to the work and dabs away blood, the camera pans out and an inky face with enormous tusks emerges.

Elephants have always had a way of getting under people’s skin.

That much was clear at the South African premiere of the documentary, which played to a nearly full theater in Durban this week. Much of the documentary, which focuses on the plight of Africa’s big and super-tuskers — elephants with tusks exceeding 45 kilograms (100 pounds) each — is filmed in South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, immediately south of the border with Mozambique, 400 kilometers (250 miles) north of Durban.

Hunted relentlessly across the continent since the late 1800s, it is estimated that fewer than 30 big tuskers remain in the whole of Africa out of a total elephant population now numbering fewer than 400,000.

Eight of them are found in Tembe’s herd of just over 200 – a small but hugely significant herd. Johan Marais, a wildlife veterinarian internationally famous for his work with rhino and elephant, believes they are part of a unique and rare gene pool important for the fate of big tuskers. But the 30,000ha (74,000 acre) park has run out of space for its elephants. Since 2007, park managers have been forced to put all its females on contraception.

While the killing of large numbers of elephants has a devastating impact on the animals’ social structures, early scientific research indicates that elephants without tusks can adapt quite successfully, National Geographic reports.

But the film’s narrator, James Currie, a lifelong wildlife enthusiast and published author, argues that it has resulted in generations of handicapped animals.

He is supported in these assertions by Marais, who notes that entire populations of African elephants are becoming completely tuskless as a consequence of losing big tuskers at their prime breeding age.

The good news, and part of the reason for the Oct. 8 screening, was the announcement of plans to expand the park and the official launch of the Tembe Tusker Foundation, which will drive the process.

Established in the 1980s, the park is owned and managed by the Tembe people, a Tsonga tribe of about 500,000. Its safari lodge is popular with foreign tourists and entirely staffed by locals.

The tribe’s leader and a foundation member, iNkosi (King) Mabhudu Tembe, told guests at the premiere that as much as 26,000 hectares (64,200 acres) could be added.

“We have already identified some pockets of land adjacent to the park. On the eastern boundary there is potential to extend the park by about 15,000 hectares [37,100 acres] … And we also have potential in the southern boundary to do the expansion that could also be a total of 11,000 hectares [27,100 acres],” he said.

“The future of these animals depends on us contributing more land to grow the park and keep them healthy and moving freely. This is something we could all agree on as the people of Tembe.”

Elephants, which can be incredibly destructive, historically roamed vast areas, unhindered by borders or fences. Those at Tembe may have had a stomping ground that extended north to Delagoa Bay in modern Mozambique and to Lake St. Lucia on South Africa’s northeast coast.

More space will mean the Tembe herd will be allowed to breed again.

A park enjoying community support

Nic Vaughn-Jones, an adviser to the foundation, described Tembe as an unparalleled community conservation success story — a testimony to the pride the Tembe people take in preserving their natural heritage.

In Tembe, he said, people had come to realize the importance of having wild animals on their ancestral lands and how conservation could improve their lives. Even as avid cattle owners, they took pride in Tembe’s status as home to the Big Five: leopard, lion, Cape buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant. Over the last few years, the tribal authority has also actively and successfully campaigned for the introduction of wild dogs, a move unprecedented in the history of conservation in northern KwaZulu-Natal province.

The park is now the region’s biggest private-sector employer and runs a number of projects that improve the lives of neighboring communities. These include free educational game drives for locals valued at more than 250,000 rand ($16,900) a year, ensuring the Tembe can experience their park firsthand and understand and treasure it.

Thulani Thusi, who serves as the park’s community liaison officer, said the tribal leaders had been open in their dealings over the park and this was the main reason for the community’s support for its expansion.

However, foundation members did not give specifics when asked from the floor about the exact size of the expansion and how it would be funded, except to say that a budget was “almost complete” and that the expansion project needed to ahead “ASAP.”

Marais estimates that putting up an elephant fence at Tembe would cost nearly $8,000 a kilometer, about $5,000 per mile.

He said they would target international and domestic funders to raise these funds.

“There have been very good negotiations with a lot of the chiefs. They have said, ‘Listen, the land is here. The moment you have the money, we can go ahead,'” Marais said.

He said money was also needed to rent the land from local communities and to build schools, clinics and put in boreholes — services that are few and far between in the area and would go a long way toward securing the continued support of locals.

At this week’s premiere, homage was paid to a “true patriarch of Tembe”: the late Baba (father) Tom Mahamba, a respected ranger and the park’s long-serving hospitality manager, who features extensively in Last of the Big Tuskers.

Mahamba, a favorite with visitors and a humble man with a real affection for the elephants he looked after, died in November 2017, before the documentary was complete.

“Tom’s love and dedication to his job laid the foundation for what is now a place the community calls a home for elephants,” Thusi said.

There is a moving scene where Mahamba visits the bones of an old friend, Tembe’s most famous big tusker, Isilo, Zulu for “king of kings.”

The elephant was believed to have died of old age, but his tusks — estimated to have weighed 65 and 60 kilos (143 and 132 pounds) — were stolen before his carcass was found.

There have been very few elephant poaching incidents in Tembe, said park spokesman Ernest Robertse — about five in more than 30 years.

Elsewhere in Africa it’s a different story, and the documentary showed the scale of the problem facing rangers, including in some of Kenya’s best-loved parks.

Marais said while “boots on the ground” (rangers) were needed to combat poaching, the assistance of people living in or near parks was more vital.

“I don’t think everybody can benefit, but the communities around the park have to benefit. That’s a 100 percent surety,” he said.

Vaughn-Jones agreed, citing the Tembe model as an antidote to the “old colonial way” of establishing parks, which excluded neighboring people.

Currently, the safari lodge, referred by people in the community as “our hotel,” employs 55 people, nearly all from the local communities. They are provided with scholarships and professional training in hospitality or as guides; staff remuneration sees more than $260,000 a year flow into what was formerly one of the most impoverished areas in South Africa.

Community levies collected at the park gate bring in $33,000 annually for community upliftment projects. A voluntary conservation levy brings in an additional $16,500 for conservation structures, and Tembe supports college scholarships valued at nearly $67,000 for students from the community.

In addition to the planned expansion, the Tembe Tusker Foundation plans to approach the KwaZulu-Natal provincial government in the next few weeks to fund a new lodge. This might be along the lines of a commitment made by the Eastern Cape provincial government to back a new community-owned safari lodge at Addo Elephant National Park.

Besides obvious benefits to wildlife tourism in the region, Marais sees the preservation of Tembe’s tuskers and moves to expand the park as important for the genetic strength of elephants at large and for broader conservation reasons.

“Fifty, fifty-one years ago, there were 70,000 black rhino on the African continent. Now there are not more than 4,500 left,” he said.

“In 1950 we had 4 million elephants recorded in Africa. Now, in 2019 we have not even 400,000 left.”

He noted that entire populations of African elephant were also becoming completely tuskless as a consequence of losing big tuskers at their prime breeding age.

Supporting the goals of the Tembe Tusker Foundation would help counter this, he added.

0,"Wagon lovers rejoice! The 2020 Audi A6 Allroad has been confirmed for the U.S. This marks the nameplate's return after a long absence. Last month, Audi hinted that we could be getting the rugged wagon once again, and now the automaker has made it official. Earlier this year, Audi also announced that the 591-hp RS6 Avant will be coming to the U.S for the first time.

When it arrives in the U.S., the 2020 Audi A6 Allroad will come with a generous list of standard equipment including 20-inch wheels, a panoramic sunroof, interior ambient lighting, and a Bang & Olufsen 3D audio system. The 2020 A6 Allroad will also get a specially calibrated air suspension with six modes. Auto and Comfort mode provides 5.5 inches of ground clearance, while Dynamic drops the wagon's height by 0.6 inch. Off-road mode adds 1.2 inches of ground clearance and Lift mode further increases that by 0.6 inch at speeds of up to 21.7 mph. At its highest point, the 2020 Audi A6 Allroad has 7.3 inches of ground clearance.

The 2020 Audi A6 Allroad's powertrain specs are pretty familiar, including a 3.0-liter turbo V-6 with 335 horsepower and 369 lb-ft of torque. Like the A6 sedan, this engine features a mild hybrid system featuring a 48-volt battery system mounted under the cargo floor. A seven-speed dual-clutch automatic will be the only transmission offered. Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system comes standard on the 2020 A6 Allroad.

“Our giant pandas represent much of what the Smithsonian does best, from conservation to education,” said Lonnie Bunch, Secretary of the Smithsonian. “As we say goodbye to our beloved Bei Bei, our conservation scientists will continue to work in collaboration to prevent these animals from disappearing, giving them the opportunity to thrive in the wild, inspiring and teaching generations to come.”

“Bei Bei is part of our family,” said Steve Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. “Our team has cared for him, learned from him and, along with millions, loved watching him grow. We’re sad he’s leaving, but excited for the contributions he will make to the global giant panda population. Bei Bei is an ambassador for conservation and part of a 47-year program that proves bringing species and habitats back from the brink is possible through global cooperation.”

Panda keepers are already preparing Bei Bei for the move to make sure he is comfortable and safe during his journey. Part of the preparations will include acclimating Bei Bei to a travel crate. The crate will be placed in the David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat. At first, keepers will ask Bei Bei to walk through it every day. After he has adjusted to walking through the crate, they will acclimate him to spending short periods of time in it with the door closed. Keepers will offer him treats while he is in the crate.

When Bei Bei departs for China, he will be accompanied by one panda keeper and one veterinarian. FedEx will fly Bei Bei and the panda team non-stop from Washington, D.C., to Chengdu, China, in a dedicated B777 aircraft as part of the company’s FedEx Cares “Delivering for Good” initiative. FedEx uses its global network and logistics expertise to help organizations with mission-critical needs in times of disaster and for special shipments. FedEx also donated dedicated aircrafts to bring Bei Bei’s older brother Tai Shan to China in 2010, older sister Bao Bao to China in 2017 and their parents, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, to the United States in 2000. It is better for pandas to travel in the fall and winter months when it is cool, instead of in the heat of summer. The panda team will continuously monitor Bei Bei during the trip and will travel with a supply of his favorite treats, including bamboo, apples, pears, carrots, cooked sweet potatoes, biscuits and water.

Upon arrival in Chengdu, Bei Bei’s new keepers will accompany him to one of the bases run by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. The American team will follow, and a panda keeper will remain with Bei Bei for a short time while he acclimates to his new home. Bei Bei will enter the giant panda breeding program when he reaches sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years old.

From Nov.11 to Nov. 18, the Zoo will hold an online and on-site series of “Bye Bye, Bei Bei” celebratory events to bid a fond farewell to Bei Bei before he begins the next chapter of his life in China. Details on the celebration will be shared and posted to the Zoo’s website soon. The Zoo will be using #ByeByeBeiBei on all updates posted on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Bei Bei was born Aug. 22, 2015, at the Zoo’s David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat. He has been living separately from his mother Mei Xiang since March 2017. Giant pandas are solitary in the wild, and cubs separate from their mothers to establish their own territories between 18 months and 2 years old.

Giant pandas are listed as “vulnerable” in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are an estimated 1,800 in the wild. Scientists at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute work with scientists in China studying giant panda reproduction and cub health, habitat and disease. Chinese scientists are working to reintroduce giant pandas to the wild.

Always free of charge and open 364 days a year (closed Dec. 25), the Smithsonian’s National Zoo is one of Washington, D.C.’s most popular tourist destinations, with approximately 2 million visitors from all over the world each year. The Zoo instills a lifelong commitment to conservation through engaging experiences with animals and the people working to save them. Today, the Zoo sits on 163 acres in the heart of Washington’s Rock Creek Park and is home to 2,700 animals representing more than 390 species. The Zoo’s commitment to conservation, research and education extends to the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), located in nearby Front Royal, Virginia.

In a statement titled “Bye Bye, Bei Bei” on October 18, Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute invited D.C. locals to a series of celebratory events to say goodbye to Bei Bei ahead of his travel to China. The events will be both online and on-site.

As per a cooperative breeding agreement between the Smithsonian institute and the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA), the giant panda was planned to stay in the country until he turned four, which happened in August.

“All cubs born at the Zoo move to China when four years old to breed with other pandas, helping to keep the population genetically diverse,” the statement said.

After they move to China, giant pandas will take part in the breeding program once they reach sexual maturity between five and seven years old.

0,"Six elephants in Yankari Game Reserve have been fitted with satellite collars.

The collars are the latest steps to better monitor and protect elephants and other wildlife in the park.

Fewer than 500 elephants remain in Nigeria, survivors of poaching and the steady loss of habitat.

LAGOS — In early October, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) fitted six elephants in northern Nigeria’s Yankari National Park with satellite collars. The collars will help WCS, which works with the Bauchi state government to manage the park, better monitor and protect Nigeria’s largest remaining herd of elephants.

“The elephants’ collars are quite valuable, not just for protection and for research, but also to reduce human-elephant conflict and promote tourism,” Andrew Dunn, Nigeria director of WCS, told Mongabay.

“It will allow us to know where the elephants are and to make sure our rangers know where they are, watch them closely and make sure the elephants get close protection.”

Dunn said rangers can now track the elephants’ movements and location better and react more quickly when the elephants are in danger or move closer to the edge of the park.

Elephants once ranged from the tropical swamps and rainforests of the south of Nigeria to the savanna in the north, but a combination of poaching, human-elephant conflict, and deforestation from logging for timber and expanding agriculture have diminished these populations.

Designated as a game reserve in 1956, Yankari was managed by regional authorities until it was designated a national park in 1991. In 2006, responsibility for the park was transferred to the government of Bauchi state, where it’s located. At the time, the elephant population was estimated at up to 350, but between 2006 and 2015 the reserve suffered intense poaching and the number of elephants fell sharply.

“During this terrible period,” Dunn said, “Yankari was probably losing 20 to 30 elephants per year.”

This period coincided with a wave of poaching across the continent, which saw elephant populations decline by around 111,000 across Africa. Some 415,000 elephants can be found in 37 range countries in the continent now. Survey data for Nigeria is inadequate, but the IUCN’s 2016 African elephant status report estimated the country’s remaining population at somewhere between 169 and 463.

Around 100 savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana), one of the two species of elephants found in Nigeria, live in the 2,244-square-kilometer (866-square-mile) Yankari park, making it the largest and most viable herd in the country. Smaller populations of forest elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) can be found in the Omo Forest Reserve, Okomu National Park, and Cross River National Park in southern Nigeria. Yankari also provides a sanctuary for other wildlife, including lions (the genetically distinct West African lion is regarded as critically endangered, and just two small populations remain in Nigeria) as well as buffalo, hippopotamus, roan antelope and hartebeest.

While investments were made in the reserve’s main tourist camp after the Bauchi state takeover in 2006, authorities found management of the protected area a challenge. A lack of resources left rangers underpaid, poorly trained and ill-equipped with vehicles or firearms needed to fight off organized, well-armed elephant poachers. Communities around the reserve, often angered by destruction of crops by elephants straying outside the park’s boundaries, were hostile to rangers.

The signing of a co-management agreement with WCS in 2014 brought welcome expertise and additional resources to the park. With support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Lion Recovery Fund and the Elephant Crisis Fund, WCS provided rangers with training, field equipment and rations, camping allowances, and cash bonuses for arresting poachers. With increased frequency and coverage, ranger patrols were able to deter hunting, grazing and poaching.

WCS also hired a team of “elephant guardians” from neighboring villages and gave them cellphones to serve as an early warning system whenever elephants strayed outside the reserve.

“The health of Yankari elephants is now good. They are reproducing and hunting has been stopped, so definitely they will increase — but it will take time for them to fully recover,” Dunn told Mongabay.

There have been no documented killings of elephants in Yankari since May 2015.

“It is a huge progress because poaching has been much of a problem in the past,” says Modibbo Ahmed, the Bauchi state commissioner for tourism and culture.

Strengthening protection for Nigeria’s elephants

There are also ongoing efforts to protect remnant populations hanging on in other parts of the country. Emmanuel Olabode, coordinator of the Forest Elephant Initiative, thinks there could be as many as 80 elephants living in the Omo Forest Reserve in southwestern Ogun state, just 135 kilometers (84 miles) north of the commercial hub of Lagos.

The reserve is under pressure from hunting, logging, and cocoa farmers, but the Forest Elephant Initiative, backed by the Nigeria Conservation Foundation, the Ogun State Ministry of Forestry, Wild Planet Trust UK, Whitney Wildlife Conservation Trust and several other NGOs, has put a team of 12 rangers into the reserve to limit further encroachment and allow wildlife populations to thrive.

“To protect this unique species of elephants, we need to safeguard their habitat,” Olabode said. “The habitat is increasingly getting more fragmented which consequently may lead to total habitat loss if urgent action is not taken.”

Despite the international ban on trade in ivory and Nigeria’s Endangered Species Act (2016), which criminalizes trade in elephant products, Nigeria remains a transit hub for the illegal trade in ivory to Asian countries.

A recent survey by TRAFFIC, a U.K.-headquartered NGO working on wildlife trade, found raw and worked ivory was readily available for sale in Lagos.

“Though most of the ivory comes from outside — Cameroon, Gabon, Congo — the [presence] of the ivory market still increases the pressure on the remaining populations in Nigeria,” Dunn said.

Building on a National Ivory Action Plan drawn up in 2015 as well as new legislation stiffening penalties for illegal wildlife trafficking, in 2018 Nigeria joined the Elephant Protection Initiative (EPI), a group of 20 African countries working to close down the ivory trade and ivory markets and push member countries to develop National Elephant Action Plans.

The EPI is funding a National Elephant Action Plan, which will identify important populations and actions needed to protect these elephants. It will also outline costs needed to implement these actions and seek out donors to raise funding for implementation.

0,"If you want to smell like fish, feed hundreds of enormous crocodiles, handle venomous snakes and observe endangered tortoises, then the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust and Centre for Herpetology (MCBT) or “Croc Bank"", as it is called affectionately, is the place for you. While it might sound scary, under proper supervision, these experiences can not only be memorable but also lead the inquisitive mind to a career in conservation biology. Many volunteers trace their progression to careers in marine biology or herpetology (the study of reptiles and amphibians) to the time they spent at the MCBT.

The Croc Bank is located about an hour’s drive down the East Coast Road (ECR) that runs parallel to the Bay of Bengal, connecting Chennai to Puducherry and beyond. Spread across 3.2 hectares, it houses more than 2,000 animals and sees about 450,000 visitors annually.

Established in August 1976 by India’s “snake man"" Romulus “Rom"" Whitaker and his then wife Zai,the Croc Bank was a response to the large-scale commercial hunting of crocodilians for their skin, which had driven many of the species to the verge of extinction. Over the last 43 years, it has assisted in the revival of many reptile species in India and is also Asia’s first crocodile breeding centre.

“We think our volunteer programme is fundamental to what we are trying to do,"" says Nikhil Whitaker, curator, MCBT, and Rom and Zai’s son. “We have had it from the early 1990s. We try to place the seed in their mind and if they are of that inclination, they take it and run with it.""

The MCBT has two volunteering programmes: a two-week and a month-long programme. Apart from this, it has a docent programme in which volunteers can come to the centre on weekends and help out with various activities. While these three programmes are for adults, they facilitate half and full-day camps for children, with themes such as “Be a zookeeper for a day"" or “Know your reptiles"".

On the Sunday I visited, the MCBT was full of tourists. I was taken “behind the scenes"", passing through gates that displayed “Do not cross"" signage. There the feeding process for the crocs was explained. “They are fed with tons of fish that are brought in every week,"" says Steffi John, education officer at the MCBT.

“A typical day at MCBT involves getting up early to go on a round of scooping crocodile poop in the enclosures with all the smiling akkas,"" says Anuja Mittal, who is a researcher working on freshwater turtle conservation in Assam. “After breakfast, activities would include collecting information on the research projects I was working on, such as noting the diving behaviour of a gharial (a fish-eating crocodile found in the Ganga) or checking on the temperatures that the gharials preferred for basking.""

Mittal volunteered at the MCBT in 2014 and 2015. She adds: “I would also roam in the park and interact with visitors and children and talk to them about the crocodiles, along with doing public talks for visitors during the day. My afternoons were spent cleaning the algae off the walls of the ponds, feeding crocodiles, preparing food for all the turtles and tortoises or cleaning the nursery ponds with the baby reptiles. Evenings are usually free and we used to go for runs on the pristine beach right behind the MCBT with our pet dogs or go for a swim in the ocean, or spend time reading in the library that is dedicated to books and research on reptiles.""

The volunteering programme is not limited to budding herpetologists. As Nikhilsays: “We have had people who are studying journalism, architecture, engineering and other disciplines be a part of the programme. They end up writing, designing and kind of shaping the volunteering programme as it suits them best. We also tap into their skill sets sometimes, like when a few engineering students built an aquarium pump that runs for 12 hours and then shuts off automatically.""

The volunteering programme is also a place to meet like-minded individuals from various parts of the world. As Hagen Gegner, a marine scientist from Norway who volunteered at the MCBT in 2010, says on email: “Apart from the fieldwork component, I was also exposed to a variety of outreach activities at the Croc Bank. These activities aimed to bring people closer to science, animals and ultimately help them understand nature. School classes would visit or workshops were held on crocodiles and snakes.""

Gegner adds: “This influenced me profoundly and helped me recognize that exposure to science, as well as science literacy, is crucial for any community. Nowadays, I incorporate this aspect in my everyday life as a marine scientist.""

Having visited the MCBT on multiple occasions as a tourist before, to get to know what volunteering here entails was rather enlightening. If not motivating the potential volunteer to take up a career in conservation, the experience will at least leave the volunteer with a lucid understanding of the reptilian world.

Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe are home to the world’s largest African elephant population and have put forward a motion for the right to sell ivory acquired through natural deaths, confiscations and culling under certain conditions. Zambia, on its part, has proposed being allowed to sell its raw ivory and permit trade in hunting trophies for non-commercial purposes. These proposals were all voted down during the 18th meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) , which took place in Geneva between 17 and 28 August. Poaching increased very steeply across Africa after the last Ivory stockpile sales back in 2008.

The CITES treaty, created over four decades ago, regulates global trade in some 36,000 species of plants and animals, and provides mechanisms to help crack down on the illegal trade and sanction countries that violate the rules.

Elephant ivory ban infuriating African leaders

Zimbabwean President Emerson Mnangagwa lambasted wildlife regulator’s decision to not relax ivory laws. According to the leader, the estimated combined value of ivory in his country and neighbouring Botswana and Namibia is worthy 600 million US dollars, ""Its a lot of money we can use for big projects in our region, but we can’t sell because countries without elephants are telling those with them what to do with their animals"" he specified.

“They bar us from killing our animals for selling ivory, but they want us to protect them from being poached,” Mnangagwa wondered. He accused the wildlife monitoring body of turning a blind eye to Africa's problems.

But his predecessor Ian Khama, an enthusiastic conservationist who in 2014 became the only Southern African leader to introduce a complete ban on elephant trophy hunting, has called the decision catastrophic, an archaic practice and that the proposal would harm the tourism industry second largest source of revenue.

A new software tool will speed up the tracking of locations where African elephant tusks have been poached for ivory.

The freely available interactive tool, https://www.loxodontalocalizer.org/, draws from a comprehensive database of elephant DNA and geographical locations, put together by researchers at the University of Illinois, US.

Senior researcher Alfred Roca has been working on elephant genetics for 22 years and saw an opportunity to develop a straightforward method to quickly deduce the source of confiscated ivory and help stop poaching.

This is an increasingly serious issue; the weight of illegally poached ivory tripled from 2007 to 2016, according to estimates by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

Because of this, more African elephants die from poaching than from natural causes: forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) populations have dwindled by more than 60% and savanna elephants (L. africana) by a third.

Current methods to infer the source populations of confiscated tusks use nuclear genetic markers. This can help identify individual elephants, but establishing their geographic origin is a complex task requiring more genetic data and statistical modelling, according to Roca.

His team drew on mitochondrial DNA which can give insights to their location, because it is only passed from mums to their offspring and the females don’t disperse.

“The females kick the males out of the herd at puberty and the males have to go out on their own,” Roca explains. “Females stay with the herd and that herd tends to stay in certain localities.”

Sourcing published scientific studies, Roca’s student, Kai Zhao, combined all of the relevant mitochondrial sequences for African elephants, verified by his technician Cory Green.

“The region of overlap across the major studies was 316 base pairs of DNA, and this information is what is stored in the database,” says Roca. It currently includes sequences for more than 1900 elephants from 24 countries.

To use the database, forensic laboratories can generate sequences from ivory and enter them as a query on the home page of the software. This will generate a map and details of where the sequence has been reported previously in African elephants.{% 9274%}

The researchers tested it with three confiscated batches of ivory, two from Malaysia and one from Hong Kong. Their results suggested the elephants were being killed in the Tridom region of west-central Africa.

“This is the largest surviving population of the African forest elephant,” says Roca, “which is a distinct and more highly endangered species from the African savanna elephant, and it is being targeted by poachers.”

Importantly, the Malaysian co-authors were able to extract DNA from the ivory, amplify and sequence it and source its location within a week of obtaining the tusk samples. The interactive tool itself only takes a few seconds to generate results.

This simpler and quicker approach will enable scientists to extract and sequence DNA locally from any confiscated tusks and add their results to the database.

Local laboratories will be able to do their own forensic analysis without relying on shipment of elephant or ivory samples outside their own countries, which Roca notes can be complicated in terms of permits and logistics.

He hopes this method will add to the multiple approaches necessary to reduce supply and demand of ivory and put an end to poaching and trafficking.

0,"An oil spill in the endangered Ganges river dolphin breeding grounds located in southeast Bangladesh has been called a ""major disaster"" by environmentalists, reports Agence-France Presse (AFP).

Around 60 Ganges river dolphins (Platanista gangetica gangetica) use the area as a breeding ground and could inhale toxic petroleum vapors when surfacing to breathe. At least 20 dolphins in the last four years have died of unnatural causes including pollution in the river and in the adjacent Halda river, reports AFP.

A tanker carrying 1,200 tonnes of diesel collided with another ship in the Karnaphuli river near Chittagong port last week, spreading 10 tonnes of diesel across 16 kilometers, port authority spokesman Omar Faruk told the publication. The Department of Energy issued a fine for polluting the environment, reported local media agency Dhaka Tribune . The Marine Bulletin reports that as of Oct. 26 about eight tonnes have been collected.

The Ganges river dolphin is one of just three freshwater dolphins in the world and is unique to two river systems in India, Nepal and Bangladesh. A 2014 study found that their population has dwindled dramatically since their 4,000 to 5,000 population in the 1980s. Today, the total population is around 2,000 individuals, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Declared by the government of India as a National Aquatic Animal in 2009, the World Wildlife Fund notes that the species is a key indication of ecosystem health but are largely endangered due to human activities.

Ganges river dolphin habitat is one of the most densely populated areas in the world and is used for fishing. Individuals are often caught as bycatch after becoming tangled in fishing nets used for shrimp and fish. They are also hunted for meat and oil, which is both used medicinally and to attract catfish for fisheries.

One of the biggest threats to the Ganges river dolphin is pollution. The WWF reports that the essentially blind cetaceans have likely lost a majority of their eyesight due to pollution in their home waters.

""Pollution levels are a problem, and are expected to increase with the development of intensive modern industrial practices in the region,"" wrote the organization. ""Compounds such as organochlorine and butyltin found in the tissues of Ganges River dolphins are a cause for concern about their potential effects on the subspecies.""

In addition to oil spills, industrial and agricultural runoff seeps into their marine ecosystem with an annual input of more than 8,000 tonnes of pesticides and nearly 5.4 million tonnes of fertilizers that are used in their region, according to WWF. A 2016 report outlined the threat from ""unabated dumping of toxic industrial and household waste,"" reported the Dhaka Tribune at the time.",Oil Spill Causes 'Major Disaster' for Ganges River Dolphins Breeding Zone,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3dhdGNoLmNvbS9iYW5nbGFkZXNoLW9pbC1zcGlsbC1pbi1nYW5nZXMtcml2ZXItZG9scGhpbi1icmVlZGluZy1ncm91bmQtZHViYmVkLW1ham9yLWRpc2FzdGVyLTI2NDExNjMwNzcuaHRtbNIBemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3dhdGNoLmNvbS9hbXAvYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC1vaWwtc3BpbGwtaW4tZ2FuZ2VzLXJpdmVyLWRvbHBoaW4tYnJlZWRpbmctZ3JvdW5kLWR1YmJlZC1tYWpvci1kaXNhc3Rlci0yNjQxMTYzMDc3?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMjA0OTkyOS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYzMDkyMzA5NH0.TL-EVZWQLtsMQJGgHqayFDD4jTEpfJuhB3syyoKPEMo/img.jpg?width=1200&coordinates=0%2C145%2C0%2C145&height=600,2019-10-30,"{'sent': 'An oil spill in the endangered Ganges river dolphin breeding grounds located in southeast Bangladesh has been called a ""major disaster"" by environmentalists, reports Agence-France Presse (AFP).\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Ganges', 'AFP', 'Agence-France Presse'], 'GPE': ['Bangladesh']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"(CN) – An international team of researchers has developed a new online tool to help law enforcement officials track down the original locations of poached elephant tusks, which they unveiled in a study published Friday in Journal of Heredity.

This new software tool, known as the Loxodonta Localizer, uses a database made up of DNA from nearly 2,000 African elephants. When a poached tusk is found, authorities can match DNA found in the tusk to an archived elephant.

Researchers report that because the specific type of DNA they examine is passed down from female elephants and female elephants naturally stay within their own herds and tend not to leave locations familiar to them, this cross-examination of DNA within poached tusks can help authorities quickly and accurately track down where it came from.

The database will also help law enforcement pin down areas of elephant poaching.

“The program enables identification of potential regions or localities from which elephants are being poached, with capacity for rapid identification of populations newly or consistently targeted by poachers,” the study states.

Researchers believe the tool could also help authorities uncover entire poaching and smuggling networks, as this kind of information could help establish trading and shipping ties when poached tusks are recovered.

Alfred Roca, who led the design on the Loxodonta Localizer and is an animal science professor at the University of Illinois, says the technology will improve as the database expands.

“Right now, I believe we have about one out of every 200 elephants in Africa included in the database. What we really need are more samples from more locations, so that the database holds as many of the rare but geographically informative sequences as possible,” Roca said in a statement accompanying the study.

In an email, Roca said the technology could have an economic effect as well.

“The Loxodonta Localizer is one step in the effort to reduce ivory demand and supply. It helps by identifying the populations of elephants from which confiscated tusks were likely poached,” Roca said.

The study notes poaching has significantly damaged elephant populations in Africa in recent years. Between 2006 and 2016, the African elephant population fell by roughly 110,000.

The study also reports that just 73 locations throughout Africa are home to at least half of the continent’s entire elephant population, and that as a result of rampant poaching, elephant populations are only about a quarter of what they should be.

Researchers estimate only about 415,000 African elephants roam the continent today.",Scientists Develop Elephant DNA Database to Thwart Ivory Poaching,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9zY2llbnRpc3RzLWRldmVsb3AtZWxlcGhhbnQtZG5hLWRhdGFiYXNlLXRvLXRod2FydC1pdm9yeS1wb2FjaGluZy_SAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VydGhvdXNlbmV3cy5jb20vc2NpZW50aXN0cy1kZXZlbG9wLWVsZXBoYW50LWRuYS1kYXRhYmFzZS10by10aHdhcnQtaXZvcnktcG9hY2hpbmcv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i2.wp.com/www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ElephantIvory.jpg?fit=960%2C715&ssl=1,2019-11-01,"{'sent': '(CN) – An international team of researchers has developed a new online tool to help law enforcement officials track down the original locations of poached elephant tusks, which they unveiled in a study published Friday in Journal of Heredity.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['CN', 'Journal of Heredity']}}",Elephant
0,"ISLAMABAD, Nov 7 (APP):Climate change is one of the most challenging issues that Pakistan faces today. It is affecting all our ecosystems, from mountains to mangroves, including species and habitats. The glaciers in the Hindukush-Himalayan region are receding, the consequences of which are resulting in changes in river inflows’.

This was shared by Hammad Naqi Khan, Director General/CEO, World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan), while hosting a side event on ‘Ecosystem Based Management: from Mountains to Mangroves’ held during IUCN’s Asia Regional Conservation Forum, on Thursday here.

The event focused on the challenges of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), floods, droughts, heatwaves, other extreme weather events, and cropping pattern and agricultural issues induced by climate change and its impacts on ecosystems.

As part of the event, a panel discussion, moderated by environmental journalist Rina Saeed Khan, was held where experts shared best practices to build climate resilience of local communities and collaborate on addressing climate issues.

The high level panel included Ahsan Tayyab, Principal Natural Resources Economist, Asian Development Bank (ADB); Mina Dowlatchahi, Country Representative in Pakistan, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); and Fawad Hayat, Deputy General Manager, National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF). The discussion spanned past, present, and planned ecosystem based management interventions to address climate change impacts in Pakistan.

Hammad Naqi Khan further said climate change is a bitter reality that poses a great threat to present and future generations.

He urged policymakers to understand that unless climate change is treated as central to the development agenda, vulnerabilities will continue to rise and erode resilience levels.

He shared that to enhance communities’ resilience on climate change and promote alternative livelihoods, WWF-Pakistan, in collaboration with government departments, has implemented climate change adaptation initiatives from the Upper Indus Basin to the Indus Delta.

He also informed that WWF-Pakistan is working on piloting new business models and technologies associated with clean and renewable energy.

He called for nature-based solutions such as large-scale plantation drives, protection of existing forests, promotion of environment friendly communications and conservation of water resources to address this challenge.

Moderating the panel discussion, Rina Saeed Khan shared that Pakistan has the greatest change in elevation within any sovereign state on earth, from zero meters at Sonmiani bay to 8,611 meters at the summit of K-2.

Pakistan’s unique geography, which stretches from glacial covered mountains in the north to the deltaic coast in the south, makes it stand out not only as an extremely diverse country but also one that is increasingly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. ‘As a result of climate change, Pakistan is witnessing rising temperatures and longer cold periods affecting agriculture output, glacial lake outburst floods in the high mountains, seawater intrusion into the Indus Delta and an increase in coastal cyclones and storm surges’, she added.

Speaking on the occasion, Rab Nawaz Senior Director Programmes, WWF-Pakistan gave an overview of the organization’s work in Pakistan and shared that the country is bestowed with wildlife as snow leopards, Indus dolphins and brown bears.

He informed that recent camera traps installed by WWF-Pakistan and the Islamabad

Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) in Margalla Hills National Park recently recorded a common leopard and other wild animals in the area and termed it a great conservation achievement.

The joint conservation initiatives are paying off as the population of wild animals is increasing in some areas.

He also quoted the example of the Indus River dolphin, whose numbers have increased as a result of efforts of different stakeholders including communities and government departments.

He also called for stringent measures and exemplary punishments for poachers involved in illegal wildlife trade in the country.

The event was thronged by people from different walks of life including representatives of conservation organizations, environmentalists and passionate citizens.

Zimbabwean wildlife authorities will relocate as many as 600 elephants and other game from the drought-stricken south of the country in one of the biggest rescue operations to date.

The animals are being relocated from “the southern area of Chiredzi and other conservancies, which have been badly affected by drought,” Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority spokesman Tinashe Farawo said by phone. Chiredzi is in the southeast of the country, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border with Mozambique.

Zimbabwe, which has an estimated 80,000 elephants -- the most in the region after Botswana -- has lost 105 of them due to drought this year, Farawo said.

Other animals that will be moved include two prides of lions, a pack of wild dogs, 2,000 impala antelope, and 14 giraffes. “We intend to start the operation once the rainy season has ended,” Farawo said.

Zimparks doesn’t receive state funding, but finances its operations through wildlife sales.

Based on an ancient Sanskrit saying, the theme ‘Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home’ will guide the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS COP13) in Gandhinagar, a planned city in the western Indian state of Gujarat.

Some 1,500 representatives of national governments, international organizations, scientists, conservation groups and other wildlife experts – together with the associated meetings of the Standing Committee – will discuss the topic from February 15 to 22, 2020.

The theme highlights the need for governments and stakeholders across the world to provide a hospitable place for migratory animals. It also underscores the urgency of protecting natural habitats which migratory species rely upon as part of their movements, throughout their life cycles and migration ranges.

CMS COP13 comes at a crucial time for migratory species. The UN global assessment on biodiversity and ecosystem services, released earlier this year, documented the dramatic decline of biodiversity in all parts of the world and concluded that without increased action, over 1 million species could face extinction in our lifetimes. COP13 will also provide important inputs to the negotiations of a new global framework on biodiversity which will be adopted at the end of 2020 in China.

CMS Acting Executive Secretary Amy Fraenkel said: “Migratory species play a vital, role for ecosystems around the world. CMS species include some of the most iconic species on the planet, including elephants, whales and dolphins, raptors and songbirds. The recent UN global assessment tells us that we must step up our actions to address the threats to migratory species and biodiversity more broadly. COP13 will be an important meeting to advance our collective efforts to meet this challenge.”

According to the CMS Secretariat, the COP13 will consider adding new species to the CMS Appendices to provide them with better protection.

Proposals for CMS Appendix I (for endangered species, providing the strictest protections), include the Asian Elephant, the Great Indian Bustard, the Bengal Florican, the Antipodean Albatross, and the Oceanic White-tip Shark.

Threats to the Asian Elephant include habitat loss and fragmentation, poisoning, poaching, illegal trade, and obstacles to migration such as railways.

The Jaguar is the largest native feline in the Americas. It is now found only in about 60 per cent of its historic range of a hundred years ago. Deforestation, hunting, illegal trade, cattle ranching and obstacles to migration pose serious threats.

The Smooth Hammerhead Shark, the Tope Shark, and the Urial (wild sheep) have been proposed for listing under CMS Appendix II (migratory species with an unfavorable conservation status). The Jaguar and the Little Bustard have been proposed for listing on both CMS Appendices.

The participants will also consider proposals for concerted actions – focusing conservation measures efforts on specific species among range states. 12 new proposals have been submitted for adoption at COP13, including for the Asian Elephant, the Giraffe, the nut-cracking Chimpanzee, the Irrawaddy Dolphin, the South Asian River Dolphin, and the Harbour Porpoise.

COP13 will in addition consider the impacts of climate change on migratory species, which is a key driver of species extinction and exacerbates other threats. While renewable energy is a key part of the solution to climate change, the COP will also consider efforts to strengthen the CMS Energy Task Force, which focuses on reconciling renewable energy infrastructure with the conservation of migratory species.

COP13 will also examine further action to address the illegal killing of birds, a major problem across the Mediterranean.

0,"Two major aquatic species facing extinction in Ganga are the gharial – a species of crocodile – and Ganga Dolphin. There are only about 200 gharials and 2500 Ganga Dolphin left. In fact, Ganga is often depicted in art wearing a white saree and riding a crocodile.

Ganga River dolphin or Susu is an endangered river dolphin inhabiting the Ganga, and Brahmaputra (in Nepal, India & Bangladesh) and their tributaries. It is also found in Karnaphuli, a 270-km river in Bangladesh.

It is a subspecies of the South Asian river dolphin, which also has a second sub-species, the Indus river dolphin (or bhulan), found in the main channel of the Indus in Pakistan.

In India, Ganga river dolphins are found in seven states: Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.

Ganga Dolphin is consider the ‘Tiger of the Ganga’, in the sense that it is an indicator species: the health of this species is a representation of the health of the entire aquatic environment. The government of India declared it the National Aquatic Animal in 2009.

There are three other fresh water dolphins in the world: the baiji in Yangtze river in China, the bhulan of the Indus in Pakistan and the boto of the Amazon. Although there are several species of marine dolphins whose ranges include some freshwater habitats, these four species live only in rivers and lakes.

During the Mughal period, villagers used to burn dolphin oil to light their homes.

The dolphin is found in the Sunderbans alongwith the Irrawaddy Dolphin. The Irrawaddy Dolphin is not a river dolphin. It enters the delta from the Bay of Bengal.

Physical Description: About 2.5m in length. Females are larger than males. Weighs upto 150 kg. It has a long thin snout, rounded belly, stocky body and large flippers.

They have very poor eyesight. Their eyes cannot resolve images very well and function as basic light receptors. They locate prey through echo location. They eat shrimp, fish, birds and turtles.

Being a mammal, Ganga River dolphin cannot breathe in the water and must surface every 30-120 seconds. Because of the sound it produces when breathing, the animal is popularly referred to as the ‘Susu’.

The dolphin has the peculiarity of swimming on one side so that its flipper trails the muddy bottom. This behaviour is understood to help find food.

There around 1800 individuals in India, and 2500 in total. In 1982 there were 5000-6000.

Hundreds of kilometers of tributary habitat has been lost since the 19th Century – mainly because presence of dams ensures no water flows downstream during summers.

In the 19th century, these dolphins were found in large schools, close to even urban centers along the river. Nowadays, average size of groups surveyed was two individuals. Individuals may also be found alone.

Conservation Efforts: The dolphin is considered Endangered. A strategy and Action Plan for dolphin conservation has been formulated for Uttar Pradesh. The dolphin has received protection in nine protected areas in India. Out of these nine, only one protected area ‘Vikramshila Ganga River Dolphin Sanctuary’ near Bhagalpur, is specially notified for Ganga river dolphin.

Threats: Unintentional killing through entanglement in fishing gear. Bycatch in gillnets and line hooks is also a major source of mortality

These dolphins can survive in brackish water (where river water meets sea water) to some extent. But reduced flows have caused saltwater to intrude an additional 160 km into the Sundarbans Delta of the Ganga, further decreasing the amount of suitable habitat for freshwater dolphins.

The dolphins also need at least about 1.5 m of water depth to swim. Once rivers deplete in summers, the dolphins cannot cross beyond certain points of the rivers, which reduces their habitat.

Killing for dolphin oil, which is used as a fish attractant and for medicinal purposes

Water development projects: More than 50 dams and irrigation-related projects have had an adverse impact. These projects result in major changes in the flow, sediment load, and water quality of rivers, which affects the quality of waters downstream.

Dams also disturb the migration, breeding cycles and habitat of fish and other prey species, and so reduce the food supply. They also cause genetic isolation of dolphin populations.

Ship traffic: They rely primarily on echolocation to navigate and find food. Ship traffic noise pollution can interfere with this, and sometimes collision with boat propellers

An endangered Gangetic dolphin died on Saturday after it strayed into a village canal in the coastal East Midnapore district in West Bengal on Friday.

While on one hand fishing nets were laid in the canal which obstructed its flow, forest officials said that the water was also polluted as plastic, thermocol and other wastes were dumped in the canal at Mugberia, 133 km Southwest of Kolkata

The Gangetic Dolphin is the national aquatic animal of India and less than 2000 remain in India.

“The dolphin had entered the canal on Friday. We tried to push it back into the river and managed to do so for at least 15 km downstream. But there were fishing nets which obstructed its path. The water was also polluted as plastic and thermocol are dumped in the canal. It couldn’t be saved,” said Swagata Das, the local divisional forest officer.

The Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica) is a mammal primarily found in the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers and their tributaries in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.

The dolphin is an indicator of the river’s health. Ganges River Dolphin is listed on the Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and Schedule I of India’s Wildlife (Protection), Act, 1972.

0,"An endangered Gangetic dolphin, which was fleeing the Ganga’s filthy waters and got stuck in a shallow and polluted canal at Basudevberia in East Midnapore, was found dead today. Wildlife officials said the dead Gangetic dolphin belonged to an endangered group that has less than 2000 surviving members. It had strayed into the Udbadal canal at Basudevberia through the Rupnarayan river, around 130 kilometres from Kolkata on Friday, but it could not return to the river due to heavy obstruction of fishing nets laid across the canal.

The water was also polluted as plastic, thermocol and other wastes were dumped in the canal. As a result, the dolphin could not get enough oxygen from the canal water, wildlife officials said. Ms Swagata Das, Divisional Forest Officer, East Midnapore, said: “The dolphin had entered the canal on Friday. We tried to push it back into the river and managed to do so for at least 15 km downstream. But there were fishing nets which obstructed its path. The water was also polluted as plastic and thermocol are dumped in the canal. It couldn’t be saved and it died of cardiac failure as there was a lack of oxygen in the canal water. We have carried out post mortem of the animal and buried it in the forest.”

According to local residents, the dolphin was seen in the Udbadal canal for the last few days. They tried to push back the animal into the river and informed the forest officials. When it was struggling to get out of the canal’s muddy and polluted waters, it got stuck inside a culvert. It also got injured. Later, when the forest officials tried to push it into the river, it again got stuck in the fishing nets laid across the canal and it finally died after it failed to get enough oxygen to breathe.

0,"New hope for the Critically Endangered gharial crocodile has been declared, after conservationists from ZSL (Zoological Society of London) and Biodiversity Conservancy Nepal discovered more than 100 hatchlings in Bardia National Park in South West Nepal this year.

The findings of ZSL’s EDGE (Evolutionary Distinct and Globally Endangered) of Existence programme have been published by the IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group in the last week but experts are keen to stress that while the news is exciting, the species still requires urgent conservation action and much-needed funds.

Recorded breeding in the National Park for the first time since 1982, the species has suffered a 98% decline since the 1940s, due to a variety of human-induced threats. Only one other population is known to be breeding in the entirety of Nepal, in Chitwan National Park – where ZSL is also working with local communities to help improve numbers in the wild.

The discovery means conservationists can now prioritise this population for conservation action, including conducting feasibility studies into whether the species can be translocated from the south in Chitwan and researching survival rates of hatchlings. However, ambitious work like this requires a serious injection of funds.

Gharials (Gavialis gangeticus), ranked #17 on ZSL’s EDGE Reptiles list are primitive and bizarre in appearance – with extremely long slender snouts and disproportionately sized heads to bodies, they are unmistakable but also severely threatened. With fewer than 100 adults remaining in Nepal, several fragmented populations in India and virtually extinct across the rest of their former range – they are among the world’s most endangered reptiles.

Rikki Gumbs, ZSL’s EDGE of Existence PhD Researcher, said:

“Understanding whether gharials were breeding in Bardia National Park was considered to be a top priority for the species, as upcoming plans to divert nearby river systems –which would likely have an impact on the habitat and quality of the river for gharial, are currently underway.

“Given the species is limited to around five populations across its entire range, this is such a positive discovery, and a critical step for the long-term recovery of the species in Nepal.”

The dramatic declines seen in gharials were initially caused by river modification with dams and barrages fragmenting habitat, and as accidental bycatch when they drowned in fishing nets. Over-hunting for skins and egg collection were also major issues. Although hunting and egg collection are now prohibited, additional threats today include the overwhelming and irreversible loss of riverine habitat due to construction of dams, irrigation canals, sand-mining, pollution and agriculture.

In the last 50 years, Nepal has lost almost twice as many freshwater species than terrestrial species – but this is not an issue only for Nepal, this is a phenomenon seen around the world, occurring at an astonishing rate.

For gharials, these changes have meant hatchlings aren’t making it to adulthood and being recruited into the population. Gharial travel large distances in search of suitable locations for feeding, breeding and nesting. This makes them susceptible to being isolated from suitable habitat since they can be trapped on the wrong side of dams and barrages when monsoon floodwaters go down. They’re also highly susceptible to human disturbance, which is increasing due to lowland areas becoming urbanised.

Communities around National Parks in Nepal also face their own challenges, however, with hundreds of thousands of people heavily dependent on natural resources for their day-to-day lives, relying on fishing for their livelihoods and food. However, fish stocks are slowly being depleted, impacting both gharial and local people.

ZSL has been working within local communities to set up ‘Gharial Guard Groups’ outside of Chitwan National Park in order for them to patrol and protect gharials from direct threats such as unsustainable fishing. Further funds from ZSL’s UK Aid Match appeal (which sees the UK Government double each donation given to ZSL, up to £2million by 31 December 2019), will help create the climate needed to continue plans to conserve the gharial.

Ashish Bashyal, Project lead and National Geographic Photo Ark EDGE Fellow based in Nepal said:

“After trekking through the jungle for hours to sit on a ridge and finally catch a glimpse of the hatchlings below us – it was an incredible moment to capture. At around 30cm in size, they look exactly like miniature versions of adult gharials – so incredibly cute.

“People generally have a great affinity for gharials, they don’t attack humans as they generally feed on fish – and their snout is much too fragile. We want to try and harness that love for the animal into local community conservation action in order to help monitor how the hatchlings fair.

“It’s not just local people who can support the project, but international support from the British public through donations to ZSL with our UK Aid Match appeal will help us to solidify long-term protection of the species for future generations.”

ZSL works with people around the globe to provide alternative sustainable livelihoods that help empower them to protect their local wildlife. By giving to ZSL by 31 December 2019, the UK government will double all donations, up to £2million.

0,"In Nepal, fewer than 100 mature adult gharials are estimated to remain, with only one population in the Narayani and Rapti Rivers of Chitwan National Park known to be breeding until recently.

Now, researchers have recorded nesting sites and more than 100 gharial babies in yet another site, in Bardia National Park in southwest Nepal.

The last time gharials were recorded breeding in Bardia was in 1982.

There may be a glimmer of hope for the critically endangered gharial, a unique crocodile known for its long, narrow snout that ends in a bulbous growth resembling a cooking pot called a ghara.

The fish-eating crocodile was once widespread across the rivers of the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. But now the gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) is on the brink of extinction, thanks to the loss and degradation of its riverine habitat, depletion of fish stocks in rivers, and accidental drowning in fishing nets.

In Nepal, the situation is grave. Fewer than 100 mature adult gharials are estimated to remain in the country, with only one population, in Chitwan National Park, known to be breeding until recently. Now, researchers have recorded more than 100 gharial babies in yet another site, in Bardia National Park in southwest Nepal.

The last time gharials were recorded breeding in Bardia was in 1982, when gharial eggs were collected from the Babai River and taken to a captive facility, researchers say. Since then, both adult male and female gharials have been recorded in the Karnali and Babai rivers in Bardia, but never a nest with hatchlings.

This year, researchers from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Biodiversity Conservancy Nepal confirmed three gharial nests on a sandbank in Babai and counted around 100 gharial hatchlings, together with three adult females and one adult male.

“Hatchlings were basking on the sand bank at the water’s edge when first encountered and female Gharials appeared to be guarding them by staying half submerged near the water’s edge,” they write in a report published in a newsletter by the IUCN SSC Crocodile Specialist Group. “When we approached closer (maintaining a safe distance), all hatchling quickly jumped into the river and started to swim.”

Figuring out where the gharials breed is the first step to protecting them, the researchers say. And protecting them is critical since Nepal’s gharial population has declined dramatically because of dams and barrages modifying river flows; sand mining, agriculture and pollution degrading and destroying their habitats; and declining fish numbers in the rivers.

“Understanding whether gharials were breeding in Bardia National Park was considered to be a top priority for the species, as upcoming plans to divert nearby river systems — which would likely have an impact on the habitat and quality of the river for gharial, are currently underway,” Rikki Gumbs, a doctoral researcher with ZSL, said in a statement. “Given the species is limited to around five populations across its entire range, this is such a positive discovery, and a critical step for the long-term recovery of the species in Nepal.”

Spotting hatchlings doesn’t necessarily translate to a better future for the gharials, though. The animals continue to be threatened across their range in Nepal, but conservationists have been trying to work with local communities living around the protected areas to help protect the animals.

“People generally have a great affinity for gharials, they don’t attack humans as they generally feed on fish — and their snout is much too fragile,” said Ashish Bashyal, a conservation biologist with the Biodiversity Conservancy Nepal. “We want to try and harness that love for the animal into local community conservation action in order to help monitor how the hatchlings [fare].”

0,"World Wildlife Fund (WWF) figures on the killing of elephants in Africa are chilling. Every 25 minutes, an elephant is killed for its ivory tusks. This brings the number of individuals slaughtered each year to 20,000. For example, the African elephant population has declined by 70% in 40 years. Between 2007 and 2015, 100,000 elephants were slaughtered.

This unbridled poaching was born as a result of the increase in the price of ivory, which increased tenfold between 2004 and 2018. Due to its central geographical position and colonial history, Belgium is a hub for illegal ivory trafficking. Between 2007 and 2016, Belgian customs officers seized 3,616 ivory products, according to WWF. Most of these products transit through Brussels airport and are destined for China, where 79 tonnes of ivory have been seized since 2000. That’s the equivalent of 10,800 elephants killed!

Donate to save African elephants

The organisation dedicated to environmental protection and sustainable development, which has been active since 1961, made the preservation of African elephants its current priority on November 19, 2019. Convinced that Africa’s largest mammals will disappear by 2040 if nothing is done urgently, WWF has launched a fundraising campaign to finance anti-poaching measures. To do this, the NGO has created the page www.elephant.wwf.be, in order to collect donations.

The funds collected will include: strengthening surveillance patrols, creating new protected areas for elephants, improving and enforcing poaching legislation, reducing ivory demand by raising consumer awareness of the cruel and illegal aspects of this trade.

The organisation also plans to deploy to African countries with the highest concentrations of elephants (Botswana, Tanzania, Malawi, South Africa, Kenya and Zambia), where it plans to develop harmonious cohabitation between people and elephants through the establishment of buffer zones and fences, as well as damage compensation and awareness of the importance of elephant survival. Because beyond the loss of a symbol, the poetry of a form and the beauty of the imagination that accompanies it, the disappearance of a large mammal is always a sign of the irreparable destruction of the ecosystem that its habitat represents, with a general loss of biodiversity that follows and very often precedes it. A loss that in turn is accompanied by the loss of ecosystem services to people. A disaster.

In aquatic environments, like the inland rivers in India, the waters are muddy. The visibility is poorer in these parts from more clearer blue oceanic waters. Many of the animals living in these waterways rely far more on sound than sight for their survival. The noise made by aeroplanes, ships and cars are examples of human-made noise on air, water and land. Underwater noise that comes from the navigation systems of river vessels, called sonar and their propellers interferes with the vocalization of aquatic animals for foraging for food and detecting their immediate environment.

This, according to a team of researchers at National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE) and Mie University in Japan, is a glimpse of the situation unfolding in river Ganga. In a study, they looked at the impact of noise pollution from river vessels has on the Ganges river dolphins and published their findings in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.

Increase in underwater noise levels due to more number of river vessels plying on the Ganga, for both cargo and leisure purposes, is having an adverse impact on the river dolphin, according to the findings of the study.

“When there are very few vessels passing by in an area the noise is intermittent, that is the time when dolphins call for longer durations or call louder, to compensate for the intermittent increase noise,” explains Mayukh Dey, a student of the postgraduate wildlife course, at the time of the study, at NCBS and who carried out the research.

On the other hand, when there were more boats passing by in a section of the river, the dolphins didn’t vocalise a great deal. This makes sense, considering noises from boats are rarely consistent enough as they pass by, one boat after another.

“You can imagine if you’ve to keep shouting all the time that (it) can be quite tiring to you,” says Dey.

Due to such modifications in their acoustic behaviour, dolphins also probably incurred severe metabolic costs, added Nachiket Kelkar, a researcher at ATREE, who studies river ecosystems and is a co-author of the study. This, because researchers think dolphins are spending far more time vocalising than feeding or resting. Such costs in the long-term could cause physical stress and affect the fitness of the dolphins.

“This means that the effects that vessel noise might be having on the species is fairly serious, especially at higher levels of traffic and in the low-water season,” says Kelkar.

By ‘low-water season’, Kelkar is referring to the dry season, which marks the start of summer. By this time, the river water levels begin to go down. With water levels on the decline in the dry season, noise levels are further aggravated. In depths of the river where the waters run shallow, underwater pollution is exaggerated due to greater reflection from a constrained space. Dolphins also have lesser space to swim through shallow waters.

“While regulating vessel traffic, it is critical to recognize that rivers need more water than they get in the dry season, and to provide it by modifying dam or barrage operations to allow for ecologically adequate flows,” says Kelkar.

“With this study, now, we have some scientific understanding about the impacts of underwater noise on the dolphins,” according to Ravindra Kumar Sinha, Vice-Chancellor of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University in Jammu, who wasn’t involved in the study. These findings can now be used to “convince the concerned authorities to take necessary actions to reduce underwater noise pollution in rivers, especially when we are going to use our large rivers as National Waterways.”

To arrive at their results, the researchers collected data at Khalagoan, one of the deepest stretches with 35-40 metres depth in the dry season, in the Ganga and also sees regular vessel movement.

At Khalagoan, the researchers recorded the vessel traffic with the onset of the dry-season., The traffic which increased beyond five vessels/hour in the stretch, from the earlier 2-3 vessels. As the number of vessels increased so did the ambient noise levels. The water levels, too, dropped by 30 percent in three months’ time. Here, the team found dolphins calling loudly during severe noise exposure. Yet, when the high noise levels persisted, the dolphins suppressed their vocalisation.

The researchers also recorded dolphin vocalisation with respect to different types of vessels that ply on the river. There are ferries, boulder ships, motorised country, sand mining, tourist and surveyor boats. They recorded how much of the dolphins’ calls were masked when they happened to be in close proximity to any of these boats. Masking is an animal’s inability to communicate under loud noises. “So if there is car honking when you are speaking, you may not be able to hear me because of the loud noise,” explains Dey. “So my voice is masked by the car.”

Dolphin calls were masked strongly by ferryboats and boulder barges that had encased engines and poorly designed propellers. Tourist and hydrographic survey vessels had a lower effect on the masking range but their sonar navigation intruded in dolphin calls.

Such impacts on the Ganges river dolphins in the Ganga are unlikely to subside in the near future with the on-going dredging and expansion activities being carried out in the river. This is being done with a view to increasing the vessel capacity in the river. However, Kelkar points out, “we have clearly recognized, vessel traffic needs to be regulated under specific limits to minimize noise impacts.” Traffic regulations, no or minimum dredging, and appropriate modifications to propellers for cavitation noise reduction are some initial interventions, according to Kelkar.

Sinha too recommends protecting our natural and heritage resources. “Economic development is essential but it should always be sustainable development,” he says.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — A 50-year-old matriarch of the Oakland Zoo’s African elephant herd died suddenly long after surpassing the 17-year median lifespan for such elephants in captivity,.

Zoo officials announced the death Wednesday, saying they found M’Dunda collapsed in the elephant habitat, and she died Tuesday before vets could help her.

They said the elephant showed no signs of medical issues despite her advanced age.

The University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine will determine the cause of death.

M’Dunda was the third oldest African elephant in an Association of Zoos and Aquariums zoo.

She came to the Oakland Zoo in 1993 from the San Diego Zoo and quickly built a reputation as gentle and kind.

0,"The Oakland Zoo’s oldest elephant, a 50-year-old female named M’Dunda, collapsed and died this week in her enclosure, zookeepers said.

The pachyderm, who was transferred to Oakland from the San Diego Zoo in 1993, was found on the ground Tuesday. Zoo officials immediately cleared the habitat of other elephants so veterinarians could safely provide medical care for the elderly animal.

But when staff arrived — including Joel Parrott, Oakland Zoo’s CEO and a veterinarian — it was too late.

Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild, though typically survive only about 17 years in captivity. M’Dunda had celebrated her 50th birthday in September.

Zoo staff, including M’Dunda’s six keepers, and the park’s remaining three elephants — Lisa, Donna and Osh — are now mourning the gentle giant’s sudden death, Parrot said.

“M’Dunda has been part of our Oakland Zoo family for 26 years,” he said in a statement. “She was such a gentle being and closely bonded with her keepers. We’ll miss her greatly.”

After arriving at the Oakland Zoo, M’Dunda quickly bonded with zookeepers and fellow elephants, often twirling trunks with Osh, the herd’s lone male.

“Some elephants will take a swipe at you to reassert their dominance,” Parrott told the San Francisco Chronicle.

“Elephants know they’re big, and we never forget they’re big. But M’Dunda never did that,” he said.

In her daily examinations and treatments, she showed no signs of health problems, zoo officials said. M’Dunda was transported to the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine for a necropsy to determine her cause of death.

The Santa Barbara Zoo also recently lost an elderly elephant — and its last. Little Mac, a 48-year-old Asian elephant, had been put in hospice care before being euthanized in late September.

Because of a lack of space to expand their elephant exhibit after changes in AZA standards, the zoo’s elephant program will not continue, Santa Barbara Zoo officials said.","50-year-old elephant, oldest at Oakland Zoo, collapses and dies",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEE9L9uXIhqgmMZbiJXIMrjQqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowjKxcMOvhCzCU9KQB?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2cc79d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1947x1022+0+43/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc2%2Fdd%2F7583c20f490fbd425ef6ba111447%2Fmdunda.jpg,2019-12-05,"{'sent': 'The Oakland Zoo’s oldest elephant, a 50-year-old female named M’Dunda, collapsed and died this week in her enclosure, zookeepers said.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Oakland Zoo’s', 'M’Dunda']}}",Elephant

As far as calves go, baby elephants are pretty cute – but this has to be one of the more adorable we’ve seen.

The youngster – still unnamed – is believed to be the first African elephant born in the UK in 2019, at Howletts Wild Animal Park near Canterbury in Kent.

She s the daughter of 11-year-old first-time mum Uzuri, who gave birth to her after three hours in labour.

Staff at the private zoo are calling it ‘a brilliant way to start December’.

‘He is already making himself very much at home and meeting the herd, who are even more excited than the keepers here at Howletts,’ said Adrian Harland, animal director of Howletts Wild Animal Park.

Howletts is said to be the most successful breeder of African elephants in the UK, with 24 born there since the park opened in 1975.

Mum Uzuri – which means beauty in Swahili – was herself born at Howletts in 2008. She was the third calf for her mother Tammi, who was brought to Howletts from Tel Aviv in 1988.

He’s said to be the first baby elephant born in the UK this year (Picture: Laura Bird/Howletts/SWNS.COM)

Since 1975, only 12 calves have been born to the 53 other major UK zoos combined (Picture: Laura Bird/Howletts/SWNS.COM)

Adrian said: ‘Mother and baby are doing well and are being fussed over by the entire herd, especially Uzuri’s mother, Tammi.

‘The little one has already started exploring the elephant yards and lucky visitors who watch patiently may be able to spot him outside.’

The Howletts herd live in an 8.4-acre enclosure in the Kentish countryside.

Their enclosure has been carefully designed by expert keepers and is one of the largest in the UK. This latest addition brings the size of the herd to 13.

The wee fella is very attached to his mum Uzuri (Picture: Laura Bird/Howletts/SWNS.COM)

The gestation period for African elephants is around 22 months.

Calves stay very close to their mothers and drink three gallons of milk every day for two years, but will sometimes continue to suckle for longer.

They can often be seen sucking their trunks for comfort, just like human children suck their thumbs.

We wonder what this little cutie will be named.

Might we suggest Metro?

0,"The Toledo Zoo is welcoming a new male Amur tiger to Tiger Terrace.

Titan, a 3-1/2-year-old weighing in at 370 pounds, came to Toledo from the John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was born at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska to mom, Isabella and dad, Sasha.

The tiger’s transfer was part of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan breeding recommendation. Upon acclimation to his new home, Titan will be introduced to Talya, Toledo Zoo’s resident 8-year-old female tiger, with the hope of producing offspring to bolster the population of the feline species.

Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), also known as Siberian tigers, are the world’s largest cats. The species averages 10 feet in length and can weigh 390-660 pounds. Each individual animal has a unique set of stripes that provide crucial camouflage.

Listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List as Endangered, it is believed only 400 Amur tigers remain in a remote temperate forest of Far East Russia. Amur tigers are nocturnal hunters that prey on elk and boar; however, prey is becoming increasingly scarce. Other threats to the species include poaching for illegal wildlife trade and habitat loss.

“Tigers are an iconic species that many look forward to viewing when visiting a zoo and we are eager to work with a young male for the first time in a long time,” said Jeff Sailer, president and CEO of Toledo Zoo. “The mammal staff is already training with Titan and are hopeful for successful breeding. Titan’s transfer is a testament to the importance of the AZA and its participating institutions to ensure future generations can know, love and appreciate Amur tigers.”

Listen to this post:

Many species of animals all around the world are at the risk of becoming extinct and it’s scary to know that these beautiful creatures could no longer exist on the face of the earth very soon.





An Imgur user called JJSmooth44 posted a series of photos of animals that have been categorised as endangered species, but what’s unique about these images is that each animal’s remaining population is visually represented by the number of pixels in the photos.

“Every Pixel is one animal. The more pixelated the image, the closer it is to extinction,” the artist explains.

He was inspired by a similar series made for World Wildlife Fund in 2008 called WWF Japan – Population by pixel, and set out to create a series of his own that alarmingly shows how so many animals are at the brink of extinction.

Some populations have so few left that you can hardly make them out from the picture because of how pixelated they are.

1. Amur Leopard – estimated about 60 remain

2. African Wild Dog – estimated between 3,000 and 5,500 remain

3. Amur Tiger – estimated about 450 remain

4. Asian Elephant – estimated between 40,000 and 50,000 remain

5. Bengal Tiger – estimated about 2,500 remain

6. Black Footed Ferret – estimated about 300 remain

7. Black Rhino – estimated about 5,000 remain

8. Blue Whale – estimated between 10,000 and 25,000 remain

9. Bonobo – estimated between 10,000 and 50,000 remain

10. Bornean Orangutan – estimated between 45,000 and 69,000 remain

11. Borneo Pygmy Elephant – estimated about 1,500 remain

12. Chimpanzee – estimated between 172,700 and 299,700 remain

13. Easter Lowland Gorilla – estimated about 17,000 remain

14. Fin Whale – estimated between 50,000 and 90,000 remain

15. Galapagos Penguin – estimated about 2,000 remain

16. Giant Panda – estimated about 1,864 remain

17. Green Sea Turtle – estimated between 3,000 and 5,500 remain

18. Hectors Dolphin – estimated about 7,000 remain

19. Indian Elephant – estimated between 20,000 and 25,000 remain

20. Indochinese Tiger – estimated between 600 and 650 remain

21. Indus River Dolphin – estimated about 1,100 remain

22. Javan Rhino – estimated about 60 remain

Isn’t it scary to see visual representations of the population of these endangered animals? Hopefully none of them will actually become extinct.

0,"A newborn panda cub in an incubator at Chongqing Zoo, China on June 23, 2019. Newborn giant pandas are tiny compared to their moms.

Giant panda babies are born weirdly tiny and underdeveloped. No one knows why, and the major theory just turned out to be wrong.

Carnivorans — an order of mammals that includes all bears, dogs, cats, raccoons, weasels and seals, among other species — tend to enter the world small, weak, hairless and blind, according to a new paper published Dec. 2 in the Journal of Anatomy. But bears in particular tend to give birth to unusually small cubs.

Some researchers suspect that this oddity has to do with hibernation: At some point, bears started cutting short their pregnancies to avoid gestating while they hibernate, and now that trait is baked into every bear species — even pandas, which don't hibernate. That theory has a big problem though, the authors of the new paper found: Pandas are born exceptionally tiny and underdeveloped, even for bears. And other bears, including species that do hibernate, are born with robust, mature skeletons.

Pink, floppy panda babies are the exception.

""They're basically undercooked,"" Peishu Li, the lead study author, said in a statement. Li was an undergraduate at Duke University at the time of the research and is now a doctoral student at the University of Chicago.

Panda babies are bizarrely tiny. At birth, the cubs weigh just about 3.5 ounces (100 grams), which means that panda mothers are 900 times larger as their babies. Only a handful of other animals, including kangaroos and echidnas, have similar weight differences at birth. Still, it seemed possible that this was part of a universal bear story ; polar bear mothers are 400 times the weight of their newborns. The average mammalian ratio is 1:26.

Newborn pandas are difficult to study. There aren't very many of them in captivity, they're carefully protected and most survive after birth — which means there are few panda cub remains that can be closely analyzed. But in the 1980s, the first panda couple at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., gave birth to five cubs, all of which died soon after birth.

Li and her co-author, Duke biology professor Kathleen Smith, got their hands on two of those preserved cubs. The researchers used a CT scanner to build 3D models of the unfortunate critters' skeletons. They also scanned newborn grizzlies, sloth bears, polar bears, dogs, a fox and other animals. Comparing all the skeletons, Li and Smith found that pandas appeared to have uniquely under-developed bones at birth — similar to those of a premature beagle puppy they had also studied.

""That would be like a 28-week human fetus,"" Smith said in the statement.

Other bears, though small, are born with skeletons comparable to other related mammal species — with no significant differences based on whether the species hibernates.

Bear pregnancies in general are a bit unusual: The fertilized egg floats around the womb for several months before implanting in the uterine wall to begin development. At that point, most bears take two months to develop, but pandas just take one.

For now, no one knows why. But as the species struggles, the question becomes more urgent, the authors wrote in the study.

0,"CLEVELAND — Visitors at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo will find some new additions to the wildlife at the zoo’s Wilderness Trek destination. An Amur tiger and two Mexican grey wolves are getting acquainted with their new habitat.

The 4-year-old female tiger, Zoya, is from Odense Zoo in Denmark and is the first tiger to come to the zoo since Hector arrived in 2017. The addition of Zoya is significant because Amur tigers are endangered in the wild with an estimated population of only 500.

Zoya will gradually be introduced to one of four interconnected habitats in the zoo’s Rosebrough Tiger Passage.

The zoo has also welcomed another endangered species—two Mexican grey wolves. Both wolves, Meraki and Sarra, are female and were born from the same litter in 2018.

They came to Cleveland from The Endangered Wolf Center which specializes in care for endangered wolf species.

These wolves were eliminated across the US by the 1970s, but have been slowly recovering through partnerships like the Endangered Wolf Center and the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.

There are currently over 100 Mexican grey wolves living around the New Mexico and Arizona border.

The addition of Meraki and Sarra brings the total to five Mexican grey wolves with three males and two new females to the zoo.

0,"HARBIN (Xinhua) — The China National Park for Siberian Tigers and Amur Leopards in northeast Heilongjiang Province has seen its wild tiger population increase.

Since it was established as China’s first national park for the endangered species in 2017, the park has seen 10 wild Siberian tiger cubs newly bred, said Liang Zhuo, a veteran tiger expert.

He said he now worries about his personal safety when making field trips to the park as the number of the big carnivores has increased.

Spanning an area of over 1.46 million hectares in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, the park covers long stretches of mountain forests.

The 10 tiger cubs were born to the original 27 wild Siberian tigers living in the area. The habitats of the endangered species are mostly distributed in the Russian Far East and the northeast China region.

China has been intensifying the efforts to save the wild animals through the protection of their natural forest habitat, including the introduction of a logging ban in 2014.

The national park bordering Russia and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has created a natural corridor for the wild species to traverse, said Liang.

The national park administration has set up infrared cameras to monitor the activities of the wild animals. Wardens make regular patrols in the park and replace batteries and memory cards in the cameras.

With the protection efforts, the number of black bears, wild boars, roe deer and other animals in the mountain area has also increased. The park administration found the density of wild boar in 2018 was 1.91 per square km, an increase of 1.34 over 2011. Wild boar and deer are the staple food of wild Siberian tigers.

Jiang Guangshun, executive deputy director of the Feline Research Center of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, said tigers are at the top of the food chain. The tiger’s revival suggests that the food chain is complete in the national park with forest resources being restored.",New 10 Siberian Tiger Cubs Born in China’s National Park,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYW9zb2RlbmdsaXNoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvMjAxOS8xMi8yNy9uZXctMTAtc2liZXJpYW4tdGlnZXItY3Vicy1ib3JuLWluLWNoaW5hcy1uYXRpb25hbC1wYXJrL9IBeWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtoYW9zb2RlbmdsaXNoLmNvbS9uZXdzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvMjAxOS8xMi8yNy9uZXctMTAtc2liZXJpYW4tdGlnZXItY3Vicy1ib3JuLWluLWNoaW5hcy1uYXRpb25hbC1wYXJrL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.khaosodenglish.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/138635408_15764857864901n-4.jpg,2019-12-27,"{'sent': 'HARBIN (Xinhua) —', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Xinhua', 'HARBIN']}}",Tiger
0,"Tembo, an African Bush elephant at the San Diego Zoo, was euthanized by staffers Sunday after a “sudden change” in her condition, the zoo announced Monday.

The elephant, a resident at the local zoo for the past 36 years, had been under veterinary care for age-related ailments over a long period of time, zoo officials said. Treatments included stem cell therapy.

“On Saturday, animal care staff noted a sudden change in Tembo’s condition, including behaviors that indicated severe discomfort,” the zoo tweeted Monday. “After evaluating quality of life options, staff made the difficult decision to compassionately euthanize her.”

African Bush elephants living in the wild can live up to 70 years, according to National Geographic. A San Diego Zoo spokesperson said the average life expectancy of a captive African elephant is closer to 33 years, according to a 2004 research paper. The zoo also points out that many African elephants living in the wild don’t make it to 60 or 70 due to poaching, human-animal conflict, loss of teeth and starvation.

Tembo was 48 years old.

Before her time at the San Diego Zoo, Tembo was privately owned and had been used as an animal actor in Hollywood. She was featured in the Born Free TV series in 1974.

The San Diego Zoo said Monday it was unable make any keepers available for an interview.

Tembo was the second oldest elephant at the zoo. The three remaining elephants include Shaba (40), Devi (43) and Mary (55).

0,"Kuzma, a 10 year old male Amur Tiger, underwent the four and a half hour procedure to repair and save his canine teeth and prevent any infection or pain in the future.

A highly trained team of 13 professionals including two specialist veterinary dentists, a veterinary anaesthetist, dental nurse, radiographer and eight experienced carnivore keepers came together to perform a complex root canal procedure on the world’s largest species of cat.

While many people dread a trip to the dentist, on this occasion, the dentist had more reason to be wary of the patient, a 193kg Amur Tiger at Knowsley Safari .

Jen Quayle, the vet at Knowsley Safari, explains: “Kuzma arrived at the Safari last summer and we’re hopeful he’ll breed with female Amur Tigers as part of conservation efforts. We’re regularly checking on his health and welfare and a routine examination revealed the need for treatment on his teeth.

“The procedure involved a lot of preparation. The anaesthetic keeps Kuzma comfortable and meant the treatment could be carried out safely. Amur Tigers can live in temperatures as low as -40°C, but the process of anaesthesia naturally stops Kuzma regulating his temperature. We created bubble wrap mittens and used duvets to keep Kuzma warm.”

Watch as we meet the Rhinos at Knowsley Safari.

During the procedure a portable dental x-ray was used to assess all of Kuzma’s teeth, which revealed he had a broken root in one of his cheek teeth. This wasn’t apparent on visual examination and was removed to prevent any further pain. The whole process followed similar techniques used for human dental surgery but was scaled up for the big cat.

Jen Quayle concludes: “Tiger’s teeth are a bit like icebergs. The tooth that you see above the gum is just part of the story. The canine tooth’s root runs much deeper into the gum and in a tiger, as much as two thirds of the tooth is hidden inside the jawbone. The total length of the canines is nearly 10cm – about five times as long as a human’s canine root canal. The procedure meant we didn’t have to resort to more intrusive surgery, while relieving Kuzma of any pain and making it much more comfortable for him during mealtimes.

0,"AUSTIN, Texas — Pandas are bears, and bears climb trees, so it's logical to assume that all pandas probably know how to climb trees, right? Wrong. New research shows that some pandas just aren't capable clamberers (and the video evidence is adorable).

Researchers evaluated the climbing skills of young giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) as part of a captive rearing and release program at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China. The team found that not all pandas can climb, and the best climbers make use of their head to help shinny up the tree, said Andrew Schulz, a conservation physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

The study was a scientific collaboration between researchers at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Schulz presented the team's research here at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology meeting on Saturday (Jan. 4).

Pandas are weird for several reasons, he said, but one reason is that their body shape doesn't resemble that of any of the other seven bear species that exist. Instead, the panda body shape is more like that of a corgi, or even a hippo — they all have a very large body and large head with relatively short, stout legs. Animals with that body shape aren't known to climb trees, yet pandas can climb trees. (Well, some of them, at least.) But until now, scientists had never systematically judged how, or how well, these lovable bears could climb.

""It’s very odd that [pandas] are such good climbers because of their body shape,"" Schulz said.

Schulz and his colleague, Rose Zhao, watched eight precious, 1-year-old panda cubs climb bare tree trunks in a captive enclosure. The researchers discovered that some of the pandas were really great climbers while others were just terrible at it. The pandas that were better climbers figured out how to use their head to grip the tree in order to climb, which is not something other animals do, Schulz said. And, hugging the tree with their head helped keep the panda's center of gravity directly above their rear legs, which gave them more stability as they climbed. Human rock climbers aim to keep their bodies close to the rocks and directly above their feet while hugging the climbing wall for the same reason.

Climbing is an important skill for pandas that are going to make it in the wild. (Image credit: Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding/Georgia Institute of Technology)

The giant panda is China's national treasure, and the species is considered vulnerable to extinction under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . One of the main threats to the panda's survival is the population of feral dogs that roam the forests where pandas live. Packs of dogs will hunt pandas; and if even if the dogs don't succeed in killing a panda, they can transfer diseases to the bears. These large bears aren't particularly agile or swift creatures, so their primary escape route is up. If they can't make it up a tree, they will get injured or killed, so climbing is an important skill for a panda.

The panda cubs at the Chengdu Panda Base that are most skilled at activities like climbing, eating and walking are more likely to survive in the wild and therefore are good candidates for release. It's still unclear if these baby pandas are capable of learning to climb as they age. So, Schulz and his colleagues plan to revisit these same panda cubs next year to see if any of the adorable black-and-white floofs that were having trouble climbing have managed to figure it out.

Incredible video has emerged of a giant Siberian tiger undergoing a root canal operation on one of his four-inch long fangs.

Kuzma, the endangered predator was put under anaesthesia while the veterinarians worked to remove the tooth and stopped him from getting an infection in the future.

A team of 13 dentists, vets and zookeepers can be seen working on the 10-year-old tiger at Knowsley Safari Park in Merseyside.

They give the 425lb tiger an X-ray, which reveals a broken root in one of Kuzma's lower canine.

Bubble wrap, mittens and a duvet were used to keep the creature's temperature up throughout the lengthy procedure.

0,"DULUTH, Minn. — The roar has been restored at the Lake Superior Zoo, where a new Amur tiger is on display and was formally presented Monday.

The female tiger, Taj, fills a void left in November, when 15-year-old Amur tiger Lana was euthanized following months of treatment for liver disease. Taj came to Duluth from the Potawatomi Zoo in South Bend, Ind.

“Everything fell into place; South Bend had too many tigers,” Dave Thompson, director of animal management, said during a news conference. “So, (it was) a little bit of luck, but also a little bit of planning as well.”

Taj was born in March 2013 at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio, and was a parent-reared animal. Her predecessor, Lana, was born at the Minnesota Zoo in Apple Valley and human-reared, and there is a difference. Taj will only be viewable from the upper balcony for now until she is acclimated to crowds, who often view the tiger exhibit through a lower-level observation glass.

“Human-reared animals are always going to look at people as the people who raised them,” said Lizzy Larson, primary carnivore keeper. “They almost look at them as tigers in human form. So they are a lot more relaxed around humans.

“Taj, on the other hand, having been raised by her mom, is a tiger. She’s a tiger-tiger. She’s 100 percent tiger. So she is a little bit more uncomfortable with people. So we want to give her space and make sure she has time to acclimate.”

The goal, for now, is to keep the 300-pound tiger from having eye-level contact with visitors, making for a less threatening environment. Eventually, the lower-level observation window will be available.

Amur tigers have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years in the wild and 15 to 20 in a zoological facility. It’s estimated there are 350 to 500 of the animals in the wild, mostly in their native southeast region of Russia, with smaller numbers in China and North Korea.

Since her arrival Jan. 7, Taj has proven to love the snow and enjoy “boomer balls” — hard toys she rolls around with.

“(She) is perfectly suited for the weather here in Minnesota,” Larson said.

Taj is the fourth tiger to call the Lake Superior Zoo home.

“Obviously, Lana was a fantastic tiger; she had a lot of personality,” Larson said. “Taj has equal amounts of personality, but just might be displaying it slightly differently than Lana did. She was parent-reared so she has a little bit more feistiness to her, but she is a fantastic animal to have here.”",Duluth zoo gets new Amur tiger after death of predecessor,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvMTQvZHVsdXRoLXpvby1nZXRzLW5ldy1hbXVyLXRpZ2VyLWFmdGVyLWRlYXRoLW9mLXByZWRlY2Vzc29yL9IBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjAvMDEvMTQvZHVsdXRoLXpvby1nZXRzLW5ldy1hbXVyLXRpZ2VyLWFmdGVyLWRlYXRoLW9mLXByZWRlY2Vzc29yL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/011420.N.DNT_.NewTigerC1.jpg?w=1024&h=640,2020-01-14,"{'sent': 'DULUTH, Minn. —', 'ents': {'GPE': ['DULUTH', 'Minn.']}}",Tiger

During rut, males can become quite restless because of their endless searching and surging hormones. Tian Tian is no different and he has days when he can’t seem to settle, despite multiple feedings and enrichment opportunities. Although they are mostly solitary animals, giant pandas do communicate with other pandas through scent. Scent marks convey a lot of valuable information to and from panda neighbors. It communicates the sex, age and reproductive status of the panda who left it.

0,"Wildlife officers from the Department of Environment and Science (DES) will set a trap to capture a large crocodile that was recently seen taking a discarded shark carcass from the North Rockhampton Boat Ramp.

The crocodile was first reported to DES on 5 January. Wildlife officers investigated the report and determined that the crocodile’s behaviour indicates that it has been deliberately or inadvertently fed.

Senior Wildlife Officer Mic Conaghan said the animal is being targeted for removal from the wild as it now poses a danger to the public because of the actions of people who deliberately or inadvertently fed it.

“We have set a trap to capture the animal because it now associates people and boat ramps with food and that makes it a dangerous crocodile,” Mr Conaghan said.

“People need to be aware that deliberately or inadvertently feeding crocodiles is dangerous and risky behaviour and can have significant and serious consequences.

“Habituated crocodiles may start approaching people which is why it’s important to dispose of fish scraps properly by never leaving them on river banks or at boat ramps.

Mr Conaghan said Under the Nature Conservation Act 1992 the maximum penalty for deliberately or inadvertently feeding a crocodile is $5222.

“It is disappointing that we have to remove this crocodile because of the behaviour of people,” he said.

“We have also learnt today that local fishers have again left more shark carcasses on the North Rockhampton Boat Ramp.

“The crocodile trap has been set near Gavial Creek and is baited and specifically designed to attract saltwater crocodiles.

“Members of the public are asked to stay well away from the trap to avoid placing themselves in danger and to maximise the chances of the animal being captured.

“I’m reminding people that the maximum fine for interfering with a crocodile trap is $15,138.

“We need the community to do the right thing in croc country, and we need fishers to stop deliberately or inadvertently feeding crocodiles.”

Members of the public are encouraged to report crocodile sightings as soon as possible, by calling 1300 130 372. DES investigates all reports it receives.

Crocodiles that pose a threat to human safety are targeted for removal under the Queensland Crocodile Management Plan.

Under the Queensland Crocodile Management Plan, Rockhampton’s Fitzroy River is in Zone E (General Management Zone). This means that crocodiles displaying dangerous behaviour are targeted for removal.

As the Fitzroy River is known Croc Country, people in the area are reminded to always be Crocwise. In particular:

Expect crocodiles in ALL northern Queensland waterways even if there is no warning sign

Obey all warning signs – they are there to keep you safe

Be aware crocs also swim in the ocean and be extra cautious around water at night

Stay well away from croc traps – that includes when fishing and boating

The smaller the vessel the greater the risk, so avoid using canoes and kayaks

Stand back from the water’s edge when fishing and don’t wade in to retrieve a lure

Camp at least 50 metres from the edge of the water

Never leave food, fish scraps or bait near the water, at camp sites or at boat ramps

Never provoke, harass or feed crocs

Always supervise children near the water and keep pets on a lead

Remember, you are responsible for your own safety in Croc Country

0,"KANDHKOT: A rare blind dolphin was found dead in the Indus River near Kandhkot village of Sindh’s Kashmore district, ARY News reported on Wednesday.

The local residents found blind dolphin dead on the bank of river Indus when they went for wood cutting. The locals said that blind dolphin might have died due to the poisonous chemical, put by fishermen in water to catch fishes.

Wildlife Protection Department failed to reach the site thus far.

Indus River Dolphins are grey-brown in colour, sometimes with a pinkish belly, and measure between 1.5 metres and 2.5 metres in length, weighing a maximum of 90 kg.

Blind river dolphins are nearing its extinction due to the government’s lackluster attitude toward the rare species. According to reports, there are fewer than 4000 to 6000 blind river dolphins left and the number is fast decreasing.

Last week, thousands of fish were witnessed dead in the off-taking Canals of Sukkur Barrage after poisonous chemicals poured into the water.

According to reports, after the Sukkur Barrage closed for maintenance and repairs, the gates at the head of the canals were opened and water allowed to flow downstream into the river.

The water collects in small ponds at various sites of the canals and greedy fishing business people pour poisonous chemicals in these ponds to kill mostly the juvenile fish at massive scale. The dead fish then collected in bags and taken to markets for sale.

The practice is a public health hazard, as fish died by poison pose threat to the health of consumers.

The district administration and concerned department, have failed to take any action against the perpetrators.

0,"An animal activist group that publishes an annual list of the “Ten Worst Zoos for Elephants” ranked San Diego Zoo Global — parent organization for the zoo and the Safari Park — ninth this year.

San Diego was included because of “irresponsible breeding, severing bonds and treating elephants like expendable assets,” according to In Defense of Animals, a San Rafael organization that has been compiling the list since 2004 and has long been opposed to elephants being kept in zoos. This is the second time San Diego has been included.

“We do the list every year to draw attention to the fact that elephants suffer in captivity,” said Laura Bridgeman, director of the group’s elephant campaign. “No amount of space, financial investment or enrichment in public display facilities can completely eliminate the physical and psychological harm that captivity perpetuates for elephants.”

San Diego Zoo Global officials did not respond to multiple requests by phone and email for their reaction to the list, which was released Thursday. They have two Asian elephants and one African elephant at the zoo, and nine African bush elephants at the Safari Park.

On its website, Zoo Global called the pachyderms at the Safari Park “one of the most genetically valuable African elephant herds in North America” and said its success caring for them earned a conservation award in 2014 from the Assn. of Zoos and Aquariums. “We can apply the knowledge we gain studying the elephants at the San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park to help sustain elephants in their native environments.” .

The “worst” list was topped by the Pittsburgh Zoo, followed by facilities in Miami; the Bronx, N.Y.; Portland, Ore.; Louisville, Ky.; Virginia; Alberta, Canada; Salt Lake City; San Diego; and Syracuse, N.Y.

Bridgeman said all zoos in the United States and Canada that display elephants are evaluated through in-person visits, reviews of government and veterinary reports, and consultations with elephant experts. A variety of factors are considered, including elephant health trends, unnatural behaviors, lack of space and management practices. Priority is given to “notable events” that occurred during the previous year, she said.

San Diego was cited for breaking up a “brotherhood” of four male elephants, all born at the Safari Park nine or 10 years ago, and sending them to other zoos in 2019. Two went to the Caldwell Zoo in Tyler, Texas, and two went to the Birmingham Zoo in Alabama, the activist group said. Another elephant, born in Africa more than a decade ago, was transferred to Zoo Atlanta.

“Elephants depend strongly on their social structures, and severing the decade-long bonds of these young elephants has likely caused them trauma,” said Fleur Dawes, communications director for In Defense of Animals.

Zoos move elephants for various reasons, including space constraints and breeding to improve genetic diversity and population sustainability.

San Diego was also criticized for its breeding practices, which have led to numerous calves being born at the Safari Park’s six-acre elephant exhibit in the last 15 years. “San Diego Zoo Global lacks adequate space and social structures to house more elephants,” In Defense of Animals said. “It should stop breeding elephants and stop pretending elephants don’t notice or care when their companionships are broken apart.”

In Defense of Animals, started in 1983, believes its annual list and other campaigns have played a role in more than 30 U.S. zoos deciding to close their elephant exhibits in recent decades.

Zoos remain popular with the public, drawing more than 183 million visitors annually — more than the combined attendance at professional baseball, football, basketball and hockey games in the U.S., according to industry statistics. Elephants have historically been a major attraction. The San Diego Zoo first exhibited them in 1923.

No one needs ivory but the animal born with it. Humans do not need an elephants’ tusks or the horn of a rhino. Yet, they feel entitled to it, and they go to devastating lengths to acquire it. The ivory trade operates because of hunters and poachers who brutally kill elephants in the wild for their ivory, leaving babies orphaned and scared, and driving the majestic giants to extinction.

CITES banned the international commercial trade in African elephant ivory in 1989, but there are still approved sales and governments sometimes allow imports of trophy animals despite laws that initially banned.

For two years, the Ivory-Free Canada Coalition — comprised of Humane Society International/Canada, the Jane Goodall Institute of Canada, World Elephant Day, Elephanatics, and the Global March for Elephants and Rhino-Toronto — have petitioned the federal government to “ban the import, domestic sale, and export of all elephant ivory, including hunting trophies,” HSI told One Green Planet.

But despite their petitions and the well-known brutal realities of the ivory trade, Canada will be auctioning Botswana’s first elephant hunt.

Last year, Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi lifted a ban on elephant hunting that had been installed six years ago. Canada should not promote, condone, or directly fund such cruelty. Deputy director of HSI Canada told us: “It is absolutely appalling that in this day and age Canada is still complicit with the slaughter of elephants for trophies. We are urgently calling on the Canadian Government to ban all trade in elephant ivory and end Canada’s role in further endangering these magnificent creatures.”

As Fran Duthie, President of Elephanatics says, large-tusked elephants are in decline and Canada is only pushing their extinction along by not banning the ivory trade federally.

Patricia Sims, Founder of World Elephant Day and President of World Elephant Society says: “The trophy hunting of elephants is atrocious and needs to be banned worldwide. Elephants are a vital keystone species, they are the caretakers of their habitats and climate change mitigators in their role of maintaining biodiversity. Killing elephants ultimately destroys habitats and Canada needs to take a stand now to ban elephant ivory and protect elephants for their survival and the health of our planet.”

Botswana is home one-third of the elephants in Africa. It’s supposed to be a safe haven, where the population can thrive, but instead they threaten to harm them more. Sign this petition urging Botswana to restore protections for their elephants!

0,"Giant panda Bei Bei spends a final day in Washington, D.C., before departing for China. PHOTO: XINHUA/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO

In November, 2019, 4-year-old panda Bei Bei, born on American soil to parents on loan from China, departed the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. (1). China's loan arrangements specify that all panda cubs born abroad are the property of China and must be sent back to China for scientific and reproduction purposes (2). The 10-year loan agreements, which cost the host country a rental fee of US$1 million, have been in place since the mid-1980s and currently cover about 50 pandas in captivity outside China (3). However, the current terms of the agreements are not in the best interests of the pandas or panda research.

When the loans were originally created in 1982, China's panda population, then at about 1100 individuals (4), was dwindling. At that time, it was important to augment the population with new panda cubs. However, the population has since grown, recently reaching 2300 individuals (5). Because the local panda gene pool is now large enough to enable breeding, it is no longer necessary to send all panda cubs back to China.

If returned panda cubs were released to their original wild habitat in China and scientifically monitored remotely, then their ecological value might justify uprooting them from their place of birth. However, upon their return to China, the cubs remain in captivity (6). Given the challenges that the repatriated cubs face, including difficult adjustments to a new climate, feeding regimen, and breeding culture (7–9), returning them to China may not be to their benefit.

The current loan arrangements should be updated to ensure that they are furthering the goals of species protection, scientific research, and cultural exchanges. The length of the loan period should be more flexible, with extensions available. Cubs should be returned to China only if it is in their best interest. Overseas hosts should have the opportunity to conduct observation and breeding projects for cubs born on their soil. This would require effective cooperation between Chinese panda researchers and their overseas counterparts at the host zoos. The financial revenue collected through the loans—which sometimes seems to serve as a commercial benefit for Chinese zoo and attractions developers (10) rather than a self-sustaining investment in species conservation—should be better monitored and allocated instead to support and research programs for the returned pandas. Finally, China's wildlife authorities should develop a more supportive regulatory framework of panda protection and research at a global scale, as well as promote international cooperation and long-term eco-cultural exchanges through the loan arrangements.

At present the population is approximately 800 gharials after conservation efforts begun in 2007.A mature male has a large, bulbous, and hollow protuberance at the end of his snout. This structure is called a ghara or gharal. And while attractive to the female of the species, it ends up entangling the gharials in fishing nets and drowning them.The ghara is not just ornamental, it acts as a sound resonator, a come-hither to females, as it were.

The 71st Republic Day of India approaches, a day when our constitution came into force in 1950. The Constitution of India is a written document that entitles our country to be a secular and democratic republic, after attaining independence from the British rule in the year 1947.

Republic Day is an important national occasion for all Indians as it serves a reminder for our fundamental principles as the nation and also instills national pride in us. It is a day that must remind all Indians, especially our children and the younger generation, to become responsible citizens. At a time when our eco-systems are collapsing and climate change is becoming terrifying real, each individual action towards environment counts.

To celebrate individual green actions, Earth Day Network commends children and youth below 25-years of age for their efforts to conserve the environment. They are named as the #EDNRisingStar.

On the occasion of Republic Day, here are some responsible rising stars of Earth Day Network from the year 2019, who have helped our country become a beautiful place to live in, one step at a time:

1. Sumair Handa Bakshi’s journey in Marine Conservation started when he was very young. Having grown up in Botswana (South Africa), he has always lived his life close to nature. At the age of 5, he visited the River Ganga in Haridwar and was shocked to see the pollution in the river and its impacts on human and marine life.

He educated himself on the state of the river by watching documentaries about the river and on the Ganges River Dolphin. This sparked a mission in him to work on marine conservation.

In the year 2015, Sumair started his own organisation called Save The Spirit of The Sea Foundation to help protect marine life and raise awareness about their plight. He regularly writes petitions and uses the power of social media to raise awareness about the plight of aquatic life across the world.

Sumair was invited to attend a conference by PETA hosted by the founder of PETA, Ingrid Newkirk, in November 2018. Sumair is working towards cleaning up the river Ganga to drive home awareness on plastic pollution and impacts on marine life. In 2018, he started crowdfunding for funds to support his campaign to save the spirit of the Ganga.

His action plan is to raise awareness and educate through demonstrations providing locals with alternative means to live sustainably and to motivate and inspire the public and school children to help clean the River Ganga so that there can be a collective change to stop pollution at its source.

2. Arpit Dhupar is a mechanical engineer by qualification and believes that we must back every innovation with a strong business plan to reach masses.

Arpit feels that technology is one of the biggest facilitators that will help us to overcome complex challenges in our country. With this vision, he started working on R&D projects which can have a meaningful impact on society, and can help transform the lives of people.

Technologies like renewable energy, pollution reduction devices, and farm mechanisation topped his interest list. Having been brought up in the city of Delhi and concerned with the state of air pollution in the city, Arpit wanted to change this situation and it led to the formation of the Chakr Innovation.

His device, Chakr Shield, is a novel technology, which causes minimum backpressure on a diesel generator. The device can control up to 90% of particulate matter from diesel engines, with no impact on the engine’s efficiency. Moreover, they do not just dump or dispose of the captured carbon.

As carbon is a useful resource, his company processes the captured particulate matter and use it to create an ink pigment. This pigment is non-toxic and is of the same quality as the ink used in industries. Each liter of ink saves 700 million liters of air that an average adult would breathe in their lifetime.

Chakr in Hindi means ‘cycle’ and they are completing the cycle of carbon. So far, they have been said to have saved over 3 billion liters of air from being polluted. It is worthwhile to mention here that Arpit was named as one of the seven Young Champions of the Earth by the UN Environment on September 13, 2018.

3. Madhav Datt is an 18-year-old freshman at the Computer Science and Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, and is an environment enthusiast. He found the international youth organisation Green the Gene in 2004, to mobilise and inspire youth to work for positive environmental change, through his activities, action-oriented projects, and grassroots mobilisation.

Today, Green the Gene is known to be one of the largest youth-run environmental non-profit organizations in Asia and Africa. He is working towards building extremely low-cost technology and data-driven solutions for local communities in acute environmental crises, across 62 countries with over 7000 youth volunteers.

Madhav has represented young people from 47 countries of the Asia-Pacific region as youth focal point for 6 terms. He has published over 45 international reports on environmental practices, initiatives, and development at grassroots and policy levels in this region.

Madhav was declared as the Young Environmentalist of the Year by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India 2010. In 2013, he was also awarded project commendations by Volvo Group and the UNEP for initiating and leading projects in swimming pool water and plastic waste recycling. Madhav has been a speaker on environmental issues at several recognised events by TEDx, UNDP, UNEP, among many others.

4. Jai Chand is a 17-year-old resident of Bhangadi village in Himachal Pradesh. He has been working to reverse the impact of deforestation. It started as a small initiative when Chand, then in Class 8, planted trees along the roadside, in the school compound and on his family’s land, which had been lying barren and would yield nothing except fodder grass.

The initiative prompted his father, 57-year-old Ram Lal, owner of 10 bighas of land, to pitch in. Today, Chand stands amid more than 100 surviving trees, a mix of fruit and forest trees like deodar, walnut, and apple. He didn’t have to spend any money and managed everything within their means.

He used to get plants from forest nurseries or the horticulture department. He would go to the forests to search for small saplings, bring them home, and plant them in his field or vacant spaces.

Soon, his passion motivated students at his Government High School, Chokar, where he studied till Class 10, and students at his new school in Nohradhar to plant hundreds of trees on the campus.

In April, Chand wrote a letter to the director of the environment, science, and technology department in Shimla, about his drive. His name was then recommended for a special honour under the Environmental Leadership Award, making him the state’s youngest winner — the honour was presented by the Chief Minister last month.

5. Licypriya Kangujam began raising her voice when she was 7-years old, about the need for immediate action to combat climate change and disaster risk reduction, and has since become an outspoken climate activist.

She is known for having started ‘The Child Movement’ to protect the planet earth by tackling climate change and natural disasters that formed in June 2018.

Her personal activism began in June 2018, when she raised her voice in New Delhi to enact a Climate Change law that then began attracting several media coverage. She stood alone in front of the Indian Parliament House on 21st June 2019.

Licypriya has been invited in several national and international events and visited over 18 countries so far as a part of her movement.

She has received the Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Children Award 2019, the India Peace Prize 2019, and the World Children Peace Prize 2019. Referred to as the youngest green activist of the World, she is often called the “Climate Warrior of the East”, “India’s Greta Thunberg” and “Child Wonder”.

6. Aditya Mukarji is a 15-year-old student working to promote awareness against the use of single-use plastics since 2018. In June 2018, he spearheaded a campaign with NDMC and Chintan NGO to get all restaurants in Khan Market, New Delhi to give up single-use plastics. Within 4 months, he convinced and converted nearly 80% restaurants, in this locality. Now nearly 95% of the establishments in the market have converted.

When he is not studying, Aditya goes door-to-door to hotels, restaurants, sports clubs in Delhi-Gurgaon, requesting them to give up single-use plastics and switch to eco-friendly alternatives.

At a #plasticupvaas campaign in November-December 2018, Aditya gave presentations against single-use plastics and encouraged the public to pledge to give up at least one item of single-use from their lives.

He took a series of these presentations with RWAs, Cinema complexes, and malls. Aditya actively participates in climate strikes in Delhi to draw the attention of our policymakers to the immediate need to address this emergency.

Aditya was selected by the United Nations, as one of the Youth, to attend the UN Youth Climate Action Summit 2019, at New York from 19th -24th Sept 2019. “It was a great honor to represent my beliefs and my nation,” he said.

Aditya, with support from his parents started a Facebook community page, The Alternatives, to promote reduced burden on the planet by “refusing what can not be reused”. This page now has nearly 22,000 followers.

7. Abhishek Banerjee, a Construction Engineering graduate and a student at Jadavpur University in Kolkata, India started his journey with a field trip to Haroa Brick Kiln in West Bengal and was horrified to see the pathetic conditions of the worker involved in these kilns.

Abhishek says that brick-dust exposure is one of the major threat to kiln workers, that leads to acute and chronic debilitating diseases. He also found the industry environmentally hazardous. As per sources, India’s conventional brick-making industry burns around up to 40 million tonnes of coal per year, pumping out carbon dioxide and sulfur.

In 2017, Abhishek along with his classmates started Qube, a social enterprise that develops bricks called the Plastiqube, made entirely from plastic waste. The aim was to successfully develop an environmentally conscious alternative to burnt clay bricks. Hence, he along with his team decided to use plastic waste to tackle two issues with a single solution.

The plastic used for the bricks is obtained from dustbins and junkyards from the locality with the help of waste collectors, most of whom were female & unemployed. The collected plastic waste includes used plastic water bottles, polythene bags, discarded plastic containers, and more.

After the collection, they are cleaned and then shredded before they are compressed into plastiqubes. The initiative has been endorsed by his alma mater- Jadavpur University. Department of Construction Engineering, MSME, Government of India and Indian Concrete Institute. UN Environment, Forbes Asia and the Royal Institute of British Architect Journal have also recognised this proposal.

April 22 will mark the 50th anniversary of Earth Day and the theme this year is Climate Action. How do you plan to commemorate this historic day? You can register your Earth Day 2020 event here.

0,"Magda, the mother tiger at Noah’s Ark in Siġġiewi, has given birth to five cubs… and three of them are as rare as they get.

The Siberian tiger gave birth to five healthy cubs following a fourth-month pregnancy. This is the second time that Magda has given birth at the zoo in two years. But three of the cubs are actually white Siberian tigers, a very rare and endangered breed.

Photos uploaded online by the park show a protective Magda breastfeeding her newborn cubs. When speaking TVM, owner Anton Cutajar expressed his content with the cubs, noting that four are of a rare colour; three white and one golden.

“Three white Siberian cubs were born this night,” Anton announced on Facebook yesterday. “God is great!”

The addition of the new cubs brings the total number of tigers at the sanctuary to 23.

The park is also home to an extremely rare and endangered White Siberian tiger, Blanca, with estimates of the remaining population at less than 20 in the world.

However, it does seem that thanks to days like this, the white Siberian tiger population might be slowly on the rise after all.

0,"San Diego’s first zoo elephants arrived by train in 1923, from San Francisco.

Queenie and Empress walked off a special railroad car and refused to budge. Harry Wegeforth, the zoo’s founder and a legendary quick-thinker — he sometimes stopped his car to snatch wild animals for the collection — tried another approach.

Suspecting that the elephants were used to being ridden, he climbed on one, another zoo employee got on the other, and off they went, clomping up Fourth Street, across the Cabrillo Bridge, and onto the zoo grounds in Balboa Park. People stopped what they were doing and stared.

Almost a century later, the world’s largest land mammals still make jaws drop. But nobody rides them to the zoo any more. Many things about their handling and care have changed as the zoo and its sister site, the Safari Park, became leaders in an industry that draws 180 million visitors annually and increasingly prides itself on conservation, not just entertainment.

Much remains unknown about elephants, too — witness the death in December at the zoo of 48-year-old Tembo. A “sudden change” in the African pachyderm’s condition prompted keepers to euthanize her, according to zoo officials. They said she’d been under veterinary care for age-related ailments for a while. Results of a necropsy are pending.

Tembo (Ken Bohn / San Diego Zoo Global)

Her death came four weeks after another African elephant, M’Dunda, collapsed and died at the Oakland Zoo. She was 50 and had shown “no signs of existing medical issues, albeit her advanced age,” the zoo said. A necropsy is under way there, too.

Elephants also die in the wild, of course, and often violently. But their passing in zoos raises thorny questions about what is gained by keeping them captive.

A 2012 investigation by The Seattle Times analyzed the deaths of 321 elephants at accredited zoos in the U.S. over the previous 50 years and found that most died from “injury or disease linked to conditions of their captivity.” Half of the elephants were dead by the age of 23, well below their expected life spans, according to the report.

“The decades-long effort by zoos to preserve and protect elephants is failing, exacerbated by substandard conditions and denial of mounting scientific evidence that most elephants do not thrive in captivity,” the newspaper concluded.

The difficulties and cost of keeping elephants healthy, coupled with persistent pressure from animal activists and other critics, have prompted more than 30 North American zoos to shut down their elephant exhibits since the early 1990s, including sites in Detroit, San Francisco, Toronto and other major cities. But zoos in Milwaukee and Atlanta have gone in the other direction, expanding their elephant exhibits or building new ones.

San Diego Zoo Global, the umbrella organization for the zoo and the Safari Park in Escondido, maintains one of the largest herds of elephants outside their natural ranges. The zoo’s Elephant Odyssey, designed for older animals, has three — ages 40, 43, and 56. There are nine at the Safari Park’s Elephant Valley, ranging from age 1 to 30.

Behind the scenes, keepers and scientists are studying the animal’s behaviors and biology in ways they believe have improved the care there and may help sustain populations in Asia, where elephants are considered endangered, and in Africa, where they are threatened. They point to the unusual breeding success of the elephants at the Safari Park — so productive that five of them were sent to a zoo in Tucson, Ariz., in 2012 to start a “satellite herd.” A baby was born there two years later, and the mother is pregnant again.

Such is the nature of the ongoing controversy about elephants in captivity that San Diego Zoo Global has been both praised and scorned for its breeding program. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums gave it an award in 2014 for “a truly significant captive propagation effort that clearly enhances the management of the species.” Last month, the activist group In Defense of Animals, citing a lack of “adequate space and social structures” for more babies, placed the Safari Park on its annual list of the “Ten Worst Zoos for Elephants.”

‘A chance to learn more’

On a recent weekday afternoon in a back corner of the elephant exhibit at the Safari Park, senior keeper Krissy Boeche called Neepo over for a health check.

He’s an 8-year-old African elephant. Like the others, he’s been painstakingly trained (with food as the reward) to stand next to metal bars and present various body parts for inspection: feet, trunk, teeth, ears.

On this day, Boeche also drew blood from one of Neepo’s ears for a new project aimed at better understanding a herpes virus that kills elephants. For a long time, experts believed the EEHV virus was a problem mostly for Asian elephants, but an outbreak last year at the Indianapolis Zoo changed that. Two African elephants, one 6 years old and the other 8, died within weeks of each other.

“We realized there’s a lot we don’t know,” said Dr. Lauren Howard, a zoo veterinarian. “This is a chance to learn more.”

The virus circulates in the Safari Park herd, a normal occurrence. But why does it become active in some elephants and not in others? Regular blood draws and other tests over the next year will help establish baselines, identify risk factors and point the way toward evidence-based care recommendations, Howard said.

“We’re trying to build up confidence in what we find, not just in one elephant, but the whole herd,” Howard said. “We want to be able to tell colleagues in the elephant-care community: This is the way you can monitor or manage your elephants to reduce and prevent death from herpes virus.”

Zoo workers are also looking for ways to find the virus that might help managers in the wild. Being able to do a blood-draw from an elephant there is difficult, if not impossible, and it’s dangerous. Can the virus be evaluated instead in saliva or feces, both easier to collect?

Neepo was born at the Safari Park, as were five other current occupants there. In general, zoo managers see births as evidence that animals are thriving.

Mindy Albright, the lead elephant keeper, said newborns also provide opportunities to record various developmental milestones — information that can help managers in the wild figure out how old certain elephants are and whether they are healthy. Another study of elephant milk at the park may lead to improvements in formula given to orphaned elephants in Africa.

“It’s exciting that things we do here go back to help elephants in the wild,” she said.

Critics like Ed Stewart, co-founder of Performing Animal Welfare Society — or PAWS — think the money and effort would be better spent preserving and restoring wild habitats, beyond what SD Zoo Global, considered a leader in conservation, is already doing.

“That’s the problem we need to solve,” he said. “The only way to save elephants is to save their habitat. And that’s not the work of zoologists. That’s the work of politicians, land-use attorneys, economists.”

His group operates three sanctuaries in Northern California, including a 2,300-acre one that houses eight elephants sent there from zoos and circuses. “Even at our place, and we have more space than anywhere else, we can’t match what the elephants need,” he said. “There’s no ‘state of the art’ way to keep elephants in captivity.”

He said laudable research is being done on elephants in San Diego, but he questioned the validity of captive breeding.

In some cases, such as the California condor, captive breeding followed by reintroduction to the wild has been credited with saving a species from extinction. But nobody has taken a captive-born elephant and turned it loose in nature, Stewart said, so the main reason zoos breed them is to maintain populations for public display. Entrance fees fund the zoos, and elephants have long been popular with customers. Cute newborns trigger spikes in attendance.

“I don’t look at a baby elephant standing behind a fence as a success,” he said. “I think the public thinks if you can breed elephants, there’s nothing to worry about. But you’re creating animals that will just grow up in captivity and live in a deprived situation. There’s no other way to put it.”

Zoo keepers would disagree with the “deprived” part. Albright said elephants in captivity don’t have to scrounge for food or water. Poachers, climate change, fatal interactions with humans moving into previously undeveloped territory — life in the wild is no picnic, either.

“These guys,” she said, nodding at the park’s herd, “get to relax.”

Have trunk, will travel

When the group In Defense of Animals released its yearly “Ten Worst Zoos” list on Jan. 23, it criticized San Diego Zoo Global for breaking the social bonds between elephants at the Safari Park by moving several to other sites in 2019. Two males were sent to a zoo in Texas, two others to one in Alabama. A fifth elephant went to Zoo Atlanta.

“Zoos regularly attempt to justify moves like these by pointing out that wild male elephants leave their families at about age 13,” said Laura Bridgeman, director of In Defense of Animals’ elephant campaign. “However, in nature, young males separate gradually from their families — they are not suddenly ripped away from them to be transported across the country.”

The San Rafael-based group has been compiling the list for 16 years, and the one other time San Diego made it, in 2006, was for moving elephants, too. That came after seven African elephants were brought to the park from Swaziland, where managers said the animals risked being killed because of space constraints in the tiny country’s nature preserves. To make room for the arrivals, the Safari Park sent three of its elephants to the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago. All were dead within two years.

Zoo officials have not publicly responded to In Defense of Animals, but the industry moves animals around for a variety of reasons, including breeding and herd compatibility, and it’s rarely done hastily. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums has a Species Survival Plan that tracks the age, health, genetics and other factors of the roughly 300 elephants currently kept at about 65 accredited zoos in the U.S. The plan guides when and where elephants are moved.

Ongoing research at zoos into nutrition, physiology and reproduction also plays a role in transfers, according to the association.

While the debate about moving elephants around continues, zoos routinely point to another reason for keeping the animals in captivity. “One of our main efforts is to inspire all our guests to care about wildlife,” Robert Wiese, chief life sciences officer for San Diego Zoo Global, told the Union-Tribune in a 2016 interview. “Getting up close to an elephant or feeling a bird swoop over us or seeing a bizarre insect — those are opportunities to transform someone so when they go home and hear about wildlife issues they can be ready to act.”

The potential audience is huge. According to industry estimates, more people go to zoos and aquariums in the U.S. than attend professional baseball, football, basketball and hockey games combined. A 2018 book, “The Ark and Beyond: The Evolution of Zoo and Aquarium Conservation,” notes that annual visitors to zoos, aquariums, botanical gardens, nature centers and natural history museums make up a tenth of the people on the planet.

But whether they are motivated to help animals later is an open question. Research has been mixed.

“People go to the zoo to laugh, eat popcorn and watch their kids run around,” said Lisa Landres, a former elephant keeper at the San Diego Zoo. “The amount of people enjoying animals for what they are you could count on one hand.”

Landres was a key whistleblower in a notorious elephant-mistreatment incident at the Safari Park (then called the Wild Animal Park) in 1988, which involved trainers disciplining an elephant by hitting her on the head repeatedly with wooden sticks. Landres later became an investigator for the Humane Society of the United States, traveling around the country for more than 10 years to inspect zoos and circuses. What she saw, she said, prompted her to leave that world.

“We can’t give elephants what they need in captivity,” she said. “We just can’t. A few enlightened zoos have come to the conclusion that if we can’t do it properly, we shouldn’t do it at all. But too many others just care about the money they can make, the bottom line.”

She’d like to see a day when people visit “hologram zoos” and there are no elephants in captivity. “If you want to see one in the flesh, you have to go where they live,” she said.

Her wish may come true. In North American zoos as a whole, the populations of Asian and African elephants are not self-sustaining. Previously productive elephants are getting too old to have babies, and there aren’t yet enough young ones to fill the gap.

But some zoos are more optimistic than others. At the Safari Park, plans are under way to build a new viewing area that will bring visitors closer to the elephant herd.",The elephant in the room: Are zoos suitable homes for the world’s largest land mammals?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbmRpZWdvdW5pb250cmlidW5lLmNvbS9uZXdzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3N0b3J5LzIwMjAtMDItMDIvZWxlcGhhbnQtZGVhdGhzLXpvb3MtY2FwdGl2aXR50gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2FuZGllZ291bmlvbnRyaWJ1bmUuY29tL25ld3MvZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvc3RvcnkvMjAyMC0wMi0wMi9lbGVwaGFudC1kZWF0aHMtem9vcy1jYXB0aXZpdHk_X2FtcD10cnVl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b3d943f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+77/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fee%2F2e%2F044c5be08e14a518b2a9772a362c%2Fsdut-san-diego-zoo-safari-park-afric-20160901,2020-02-02,"{'sent': 'San Diego’s first zoo elephants arrived by train in 1923, from San Francisco.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['San Diego', 'San Francisco']}}",Elephant

Wildlife care specialists are working with the African elephant herd at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park to find out more about a disease that was recently identified as a threat to the species. Elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (also known by the acronym EEHV) is carried by both Asian and African elephant species, but until last year had been associated most frequently with deaths of young Asian elephants.

“EEHV is a virus that has evolved along with elephant species, over millions of years, and occurs in individuals in native and zoo settings,” said Lauren Howard, DVM, director of veterinary services at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

The threat of the virus to young Asian elephants has been studied for many years by zoos working toward understanding EEHV and its impact on individual elephants, and on entire populations. Last year, two young African elephants at another institution died of the disease—and now, Safari Park wildlife care specialists, veterinarians and researchers have begun a project to learn more about the virus, so that it can be better understood in African elephants.

“Because of the strong relationship the elephant care specialists at the Safari Park have with the elephant herd, they are able to work with them to take regular blood samples and trunk washes,” said Kristi Burtis, elephant care manager, San Diego Zoo Safari Park. “We hope the information we gather will allow us to develop ways to manage the disease in populations of elephants in Africa and Asia.”

Madhya Pradesh, which regained the coveted 'tiger state' tag last year, has added another feather to its cap by emerging on top in the count of gharials (fresh water crocodiles) this year, state Forest Minister Umang Singhar claimed on Tuesday.

As per a report of the Wildlife Trust of India, there are 1,255 gharials in the Chambal river of Madhya Pradesh and 255 in the Gandak river of Bihar, Umang Singhar told PTI.

Umang Singhar further said that according to a departmental census report of Morena's Divisional Forest Officer PD Graviel, there are 1,876 gharials in the Chambal river.

""Besides being the tiger state, Madhya Pradesh has also emerged as the 'gharial state' in the country,"" he said. Efforts made for their conservation and protection have started bearing fruits now. It is basically the result of hard work done by officials,"" PD Graviel added.

With 526 tigers, Madhya Pradesh last year regained the coveted ""tiger state"" status after losing it to Karnataka nearly a decade ago, thanks to its focus on conserving the wildlife outside the protected areas of reserves.

A state forest department official said in 1980s, only about 200 gharials were left in the world. At that time, their number in India was 96, including 46 in the Chambal river that flows across Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.

Later, the river spread over an area of 435 km and was declared as the Chambal Gharial Sanctuary, Umang Singhar said.

PD Graviel said that one of the major reasons for the increase in number of gharials in the state is the creation of Devri Eco Centre where crocodile eggs are reared. After the eggs mature, the hatchlings are kept under observation for three years before being released in the Chambal river.

""Every year, 200 gharials are released into the Chambal river under the 'grow and release' programme for conservation of this aquatic species,"" PD Graviel said.

Graviel also informed that gharials are found in very few countries in the world, including India, Bangladesh and Nepal.

Gharials were earlier on the verge of extinction in the country, but now efforts to conserve the aquatic animal have paid and ""Madhya Pradesh has emerged at the top spot in this area also"", Graviel said.

Though gharials are found in many rivers of the country, their number there is quite less as they traverse only in deep and clean water.

""Gharials are shy in nature and maintain a distance with other animals. They remain in groups and are a major

attraction for tourists in the Chambal river,"" another forest official said.","Madhya Pradesh on top spot in gharial count, says state forest minister",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXkuaW4vaW5kaWEvc3RvcnkvbWFkaHlhLXByYWRlc2gtdG9wLXNwb3QtZ2hhcmlhbC1jb3VudC1zYXlzLXN0YXRlLWZvcmVzdC1taW5pc3Rlci0xNjQzMTc0LTIwMjAtMDItMDTSAX1odHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRpYXRvZGF5LmluL2FtcC9pbmRpYS9zdG9yeS9tYWRoeWEtcHJhZGVzaC10b3Atc3BvdC1naGFyaWFsLWNvdW50LXNheXMtc3RhdGUtZm9yZXN0LW1pbmlzdGVyLTE2NDMxNzQtMjAyMC0wMi0wNA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202002/gharia-647x363.jpeg?4VNiRebH2sDe0GcIownG_ABtQCn4VHoA,2020-02-04,"{'sent': 'A state forest department official said in 1980s, only about 200 gharials were left in the world.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['only about 200']}}",Tiger

The forest department officials of several districts of western Uttar Pradesh have submitted their plans for the preparation of a draft integrated management plan for the Upper Ganga Ramsar Site, spread over an 85km stretch from Brijghat in Hapur to Narora in Bulandshahr.

Officials said the plan is proposed for five years and will largely benefit the Gangetic dolphins, ghariyals and other aquatic species.

The preparation of the plan is underway on the directions of the Union environment ministry. The Ramsar site in the upper Ganga river is one of the 130 sites selected across the country to have such a plan. The 85km stretch was declared a Ramsar site in 2005 and is home to the Gangetic dolphin, whose figures as per a survey conducted by the UP forest department and World Wide Fund for Nature-India (WWF-India) are 33 in 2018, as against 22 in 2015.

“The plan is aimed at protecting the Gangetic dolphins, ghariyals and other aquatic species. We have sent our plans to the principal chief conservator of forests in Lucknow and it will be forwarded to the Centre,” NK Janu, chief conservator of forests (Meerut), said.

The Ganges river dolphin (Platanista gangetica) is one of the two subspecies of the South Asian river dolphin, the other being the Indus dolphin, found in the Indus river in Pakistan and Beas river in India.

“There is a marked presence of Gangetic dolphins at the Ramsar site. The plan is aimed at protecting them with measures such as reduction in pollution, community participation and protection of the ecosystem,” Janu said.

The four districts through which the Ramsar site passes are Hapur, Amroha, Sambhal and Bulandshahr. According to officials, the stretch also saw the release of 788 ghariyals between 2009 and 2019 in order to replenish their numbers.

“We have sent our requirement for equipment for protection and rescue of dolphins, a control centre which is to be established for surveillance etc,” Diksha Bhandari, divisional forest officer (Ghaziabad and Hapur), said.

According to officials, the Union ministry has also roped in WWF-India as knowledge partner as the agency is already taking up dolphin conservation and other measures at the Ramsar site.

According to officials, the draft plan preparation is in process and encompasses different aspects related to health of the river and the ecosystem along with species; regular checking of water quality and quantity; collaboration with local communities so there is focus on sustainable fishing and agriculture in order to reduce the use of pesticides; integrated management regime for better governance so that different departments and stakeholders coordinate in a better manner.",Pitching in to save Gangetic dolphins,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvcGl0Y2hpbmctaW4tdG8tc2F2ZS1nYW5nZXRpYy1kb2xwaGlucy9zdG9yeS1haVowUm4wUkduMTZmek0ydFh0YUxOLmh0bWzSAW9odHRwczovL20uaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2NpdGllcy9waXRjaGluZy1pbi10by1zYXZlLWdhbmdldGljLWRvbHBoaW5zL3N0b3J5LWFpWjBSbjBSR24xNmZ6TTJ0WHRhTE5fYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/2019/7/960x540.jpg,2020-02-05,"{'sent': 'The forest department officials of several districts of western Uttar Pradesh have submitted their plans for the preparation of a draft integrated management plan for the Upper Ganga Ramsar Site, spread over an 85km stretch from Brijghat in Hapur to Narora in Bulandshahr.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Upper Ganga Ramsar Site'], 'QUANTITY': ['85km'], 'GPE': ['Bulandshahr', 'Hapur', 'Narora']}}",Indus River Dolphin

0,"Stories of unique and sentient interactions between elephants and their dead are a familiar part of the species’ lore, but a comprehensive study of these interactions has been lacking — until now. A recent review of documented field observations of elephants at carcasses reveals patterns of elephants’ behavior toward their dead, regardless of the strength of former relationships with the deceased individual.

“Witnessing elephants interact with their dead sends chills up one’s spine, as the behavior so clearly indicates advanced feeling.” George Wittemyer, Ph.D.

The findings, published in the journal Primates, indicate that elephants exhibit a generalized interest in their dead, even after bodies have long decayed — and even if the elephants studied were not closely bonded to the dead individual. The most common behaviors observed were approaching the dead, touching and examining the carcass. Elephants also appeared to use their advanced sense of smell to identify dead individuals, and they were observed vocalizing and attempting to lift or pull fallen elephants that had just died.

The research was led by Shifra Goldenberg, Ph.D., from the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, and George Wittemyer, Ph.D., from Save the Elephants and the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Conservation Biology at Colorado State University. The project was funded by Save the Elephants, the National Science Foundation and Colorado State University.

The study consisted of a literature review of 32 original observations of wild elephant carcasses from 12 distinct sources across Africa. Despite variability across sources in methodology, some trends were apparent.

“The most commonly recorded behavior of elephants towards their dead included touching, approaching the dead animal and investigating the carcass,” said Goldenberg. “The motivations underlying observed behaviors are hard to know, but clearly varied across circumstances and individuals. For example, some elephants made repeated visits to a carcass, and it’s possible that temporal gland streaming by a young female at the site of her mother’s carcass is associated with heightened emotion.”

Elephants form lasting relationships over decades, and individuals maintain different types of relationships across populations. They live in socially complex, fission-fusion societies, in which social groups divide and merge over time. These complex relationships necessitate recognizing and remembering a wide range of individuals in their species. Not surprisingly, elephants have demonstrated notable cognitive abilities, extensive memory, and highly sophisticated olfaction.

“Witnessing elephants interact with their dead sends chills up one’s spine, as the behavior so clearly indicates advanced feeling,” said Wittemyer. “This is one of the many magnificent aspects of elephants that we have observed, but cannot fully comprehend.” When greeting each other after separation, elephants engage in prolonged olfactory and tactile investigation, suggesting that they’re constantly updating social and spatial information. It is possible that elephant behavior toward a carcass serves the same purpose as who an elephant interacts with and has important implications in an individual’s survival.

The researchers said they hope future studies will be performed to better understand elephant memory and further explore the possibility of grief and emotion in elephants’ responses to death.

0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the largest turtles that ever lived prowled the lakes and rivers of northern South America from about 13 million years ago to 7 million years ago - and this car-sized freshwater beast was built for battle.

Scientists said on Wednesday they have unearthed new fossils of the turtle, called Stupendemys geographicus, in Colombia’s Tatacoa Desert and Venezuela’s Urumaco region that for the first time provide a comprehensive understanding of the big reptile, which got up to 13 feet (4 meters) long and 1.25 tons in weight.

Stupendemys males, unlike the females, boasted sturdy front-facing horns on both sides of the carapace - or shell - very close to the neck. Deep scars detected in the fossils indicated that these horns may have been used like a lance for fighting with other Stupendemys males over mates or territory.

Fighting occurs among certain turtles alive today, particularly between male tortoises, according to paleontologist Edwin Cadena of the Universidad del Rosario in Bogota, who led the research published in the journal Science Advances.

Stupendemys is the second-largest known turtle, behind seagoing Archelon, which lived roughly 70 million years ago at the end of the age of dinosaurs and reached about 15 feet (4.6 meters) in length.

The first Stupendemys fossils were found in the 1970s but many mysteries remained about the animal. The new fossils included the largest-known turtle shell - 9.4 feet (2.86 meters) long, even larger than Archelon’s shell - and the first lower jaw remains, which gave clues about its diet.

“Stupendemys geographicus was huge and heavy. The largest individuals of this species were about the size and length of a sedan automobile if we take into account the head, neck, shell and limbs,” Cadena said.

“Its diet was diverse including small animals - fishes, caimans, snakes - as well as mollusks and vegetation, particularly fruits and seeds. Putting together all the anatomical features of this species indicates that its lifestyle was mostly in the bottom of large freshwater bodies including lakes and large rivers,” Cadena added.

Stupendemys - meaning “stupendous turtle” - inhabited a colossal wetlands system spanning Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Peru before the Amazon and Orinoco rivers were formed.

Its large size may have been crucial in defending against formidable predators. It shared the environment with giant crocodilians including the 36-foot-long (11-meter-long) caiman Purussaurus and the 33-foot-long (10-meter-long) gavial relative Gryposuchus.

0,"For the first time ever, scientists were able to document the behavior of a GPS-collared Amur tiger in the wild for the four months before and four months after the birth of her cubs.

The study, published in the journal Mammal Research, reveals that the new tiger mom made time for her cubs by abandoning defense of her territory, traveling more rapidly from kills, making fewer but larger kills, and resting less.

The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), sometimes referred to as the Siberian tiger, is currently listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List.

Poaching is now the biggest threat to the wild Amur tigers, as tiger parts continue to be in high demand throughout Asia for use as ornaments, in traditional medicine, and as a status symbol.

Being a single mom is tough, even for a strong and formidable tigress. Hunting, protecting the territory, spending time with the cubs, resting — how does she do it all?

For the first time ever, scientists were able to document the behavior of a GPS-collared Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the wild for the four months before and four months after the birth of her cubs. The study, published in journal Mammal Research, reveals the sacrifices and changes the new mother, called Vavarra, made to care for her young.

“This study shows that even tigers struggle balancing ‘work’ and ‘family time.’ It’s a constant balancing act to keep their cubs safe while trying to keep themselves fed,” Dale Miquelle, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) Russia program and tiger program coordinator, said in a statement.

Tiger cubs are vulnerable to predation from wolves, bears, lynxes and leopards, so Vavarra’s strategy was to spend as much time with her cubs as possible to keep them protected. To achieve this balance, she abandoned defending her territory, moved around less, traveled more rapidly, made fewer but larger kills, and spent a lot less time resting.

“The results simply provide a more graphic understanding of what we already intuitively know — that raising kids is hard, and for single moms, it is especially hard. Tigresses need to make sacrifices, and balance protection and nurture to be successful. Many cubs are no doubt lost during this early period,” Miquelle told Mongabay.

Once her cubs were born, Vavarra greatly reduced the size of her range from around 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) down to 180 km2 (70 mi2). Overall, she spent less time moving, but when she did travel, she moved more quickly, especially when returning home from a kill. When the cubs were old enough to travel, she brought them with her to kill sites where she could both protect and feed the cubs and herself.

“A tiger, like most large carnivores, is in a continual race trying to stay ahead of starvation,” Miquelle said. “Any slight injury, or a few missed opportunities, put a tiger at a huge risk of not making it. So when you add the additional burdens of ‘how do I keep my cubs safe from other predators?’ and ‘how do I make sure that not only am I fed, but how do I get enough calories to my cubs to keep them fed?’ you can see the dilemma.”

The Amur tiger, sometimes referred to as the Siberian tiger (though it doesn’t live in Siberia), is currently listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List. A 2015 census estimated between 523 to 540 individuals in the wild, though there haven’t been any scientifically rigorous surveys of the wild population, according to Miquelle. And, because the majority of the Amur tiger population lives in the harsh environment of the Russian Far East, they are notoriously difficult to study.

“Getting this information is not easy. The fact that no one has done this before is an indication of the difficulty,” Miquelle said. “Because we had a GPS collar on Vavarra, those locations came regularly. But to find out what she was doing required us to be in the field nearly every day, checking locations where she had been.”

By finding Vavarra’s tracks in the snow, the scientists were able to “walk in her footsteps and essentially relive those moments with her,” Miquelle said. Retracing her steps allowed the team to find the kills she made, estimate how long she stayed at kills, and get a sense of how she traveled to and from those sites.

“Our goal is to never see the tiger to avoid influencing her behavior, but to be constantly ‘one step behind,’” Miquelle said. “For me, it is a real privilege to be able to walk in the steps of a tiger. It never gets old.”

In the 1930s, Amur tigers were on the verge of extinction, with a population of around 30 animals. Conservation measures, such as a strict ban on hunting enforced by dedicated rangers, brought the tigers back from the brink. However, tigers still face substantial threats from habitat loss, roads, illegal hunting of tiger prey such as deer and wild boar, and poaching.

Tiger parts continue to be in high demand throughout Asia for use as ornaments, in traditional medicine, and as a status symbol. The availability of tiger parts from breeding facilities known as “tiger farms” legitimizes and increases this demand, contributing to the main threat to the wild tiger, poaching. The Wildlife Conservation Society estimates that, in the Russian Far East, 20-30 tigers are poached every year.

“I never cease to be amazed by [the tiger’s] strength, adaptability, and persistence,” Miquelle said. “But it is because of these characteristics that they are sought after for traditional medicines by people who believe in the curative process of tiger body parts. Unless people from Asian cultures change their appetite for tiger medicines, we could lose tigers in the wild, and the miracle of their existence would be gone.”

Fossilized remains of one of the largest turtles that ever lived — a car-sized freshwater beast — have been unearthed in Colombia’s Tatacoa Desert and Venezuela’s Urumaco region, scientists said on Wednesday.

0,"India is set to host the UN biodiversity summit that will bring together more than 1,200 delegates from over 110 countries to deliberate on the alarming decline of migratory species in Gandhinagar in Gujarat from Monday.

The agenda of the talks include new proposals to mitigate effects of infrastructure on migratory mammals and joining the Gobi bear, the only bear living in the desert, the Persian leopard and the urial, a wild sheep, in the Central Asian mammal species for their protection.

Besides, Indian species like the Asian elephant, the great Indian bustard and the Ganges river dolphin are likely to get more priority in biodiversity conservation.

Roads, railway tracks and fences can create barriers to the movement of animals, many of which are hit and killed by vehicles or trains when attempting to cross, while others get entangled in barbed wire fences and die.

Barriers disrupt habitat connectivity and can lead to genetic isolation, driving populations to local extinction.

Roads, railway lines, and settlements cutting through habitats can also increase disturbance to wildlife, pollute their feeding areas, and ease access for poachers.

Delegates at the 13th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS COP13) will consider the need for guidance and implementation tools to mitigate the impacts of linear infrastructure on migratory species.

CMS is the only United Nations treaty that addresses migratory species and their habitats.

""Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home"" will be the theme of the UN wildlife conference dedicated to migratory species. It will conclude on February 22.

Globally, at least 25 million km of new roads are projected for development by 2050, marking a 60 per cent increase from 2010.

Similarly, the development of an additional 3,35,000 km of railway tracks is expected over the next 40 years to accommodate demand for passenger and freight travel.

Given the predicted scale of increase across the world, measures to conserve migratory animals are especially urgent.

To date, CMS Guidelines have advised countries on how to avert linear infrastructure threats to large mammals in Central Asia through the Convention's Central Asian Mammals Initiative.

In the future, guidance and implementation tools will be developed for other regions and CMS-listed species not included in the initiative.

Aquatic species face other threats from different types of infrastructure, including coastal developments such as hotels, restaurants, and roads.

Turtle nesting beaches are at risk while beaches, seawalls and oil platforms also degrade turtle habitats.

Currently, CMS Guidelines deal with underwater noise, but other threats related to infrastructure development are yet to be addressed, say wildlife experts.

The Gobi bear, the only bear living in the desert, the Persian leopard and the urial, a wild sheep, are set to join other Central Asian mammal species already benefiting from international cooperation under the CMS.

The urial is being proposed for listing on Appendix II at CMS COP13, while range states are seeking to include it as well as the Gobi bear and Persian Leopard under the Central Asian Mammals Initiative (CAMI).

In many parts of the species' range, urial populations are declining, have become fragmented and are prone to local extinction.

Currently, CAMI covers 15 species including the Saiga antelope, the snow leopard and the cheetah.

The initiative spans 14 countries from the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan in the west to China in the east.

Central Asia boasts the world's largest intact grasslands, but the scale of this habitat is being threatened by the rapid construction of roads and railways.

Many migratory mammals rely on these large steppe ecosystems and on the region's deserts and mountains for their survival. Linear barriers to migration, coupled with illegal hunting are putting their survival at risk.

Targeting threats from the construction of linear infrastructure is part of a comprehensive package of conservation measures that CAMI range states are expected to adopt at COP13 for the period 2021-2026.

Decisions at CMS COP13 will result in targeted action on aquatic wild meat, which is a fast-emerging threat on a scale similar to that facing terrestrial animals.

The CMS Aquatic Wild Meat Working Group, which has focused mainly on mammals and reptiles, is poised to expand its scope to cover all shark and ray species listed on CMS Appendix I.

Criteria will also be developed to consider aquatic species listed on Appendix II, while more attention will be given to the harvesting of seabirds.

Outcomes expected at CMS COP13 include negotiated decisions, political commitments and new initiatives, including proposals to add 10 new species for protection under the CMS.

These include the Asian elephant, the jaguar, the great Indian bustard, and the smooth hammerhead shark.

Parties will also discuss the adoption of dedicated concerted actions for 12 different species, including the giraffe, the Ganges river dolphin, the common guitarfish and the antipodean Albatross.

0,"An Indus river Dolphin

Gharials, which disappeared from the river, have been reintroduced

The Indus river dolphin was thought to have disappeared from the Beas river, fragmented by dams , barrages and canals.The bulk of the 1,800-odd members of the endangered mammal species now live in the lower Indus in Pakistan. So there was much excitement when an Indus dolphin was spotted in the Beas in 2007. Today, the Beas is the only Indian habitat of the functionally blind mammal, which uses echolocation to navigate underwater and hunt for food.The presence of bhulan, as the dolphin is locally known, and the reintroduction of the long-snouted gharial, also critically endangered, into the Beas led the Punjab government to declare the 185-km Beas stretch a conservation reserve in 2017 — the first river in India to be accorded this status.“Till 2017, there was no legal protection for this area from the Wildlife (Protection) Act. Declaring it a conservation reserve was important for the protection of these endangered species,” says Kuldeep Kumar, Punjab’s principal chief conservator of forests.Commercial fishing and netting have since been banned and the number of dolphins in the Beas is now estimated at 10, including calves, which indicates that this is a breeding population.“Since the area was declared a reserve, indiscriminate fishing has significantly come down,” says Suresh Babu, director-river basins & water policy at World Wildlife Fund-India, a non-profit working with the Punjab forest department in conservation efforts.The presence of dolphins is an indication of the health of the Beas ecosystem which is also home to other rare species like the fishing cat and the smooth-coated Indian otter. The river is also home to over 500 species of birds and over 90 kinds of fish.In 2018, 47 gharials, a fish-eating crocodile that had become locally extinct in the 1980s, were added to this river ecosystem. Twentyfive more gharial hatchlings from a hatchery in Morena, Madhya Pradesh, are likely to be released into the river soon.Conservationists also hope that one day, gharials may even return to the Indus river system in Pakistan, the semiaquatic reptile’s natural habitat till the 1930s. “If a few individual gharials go down about 19 km and swim into Pakistan, it is a bonus. Wildlife has no borders,” says BC Choudhury, wildlife scientist and an expert on the gharial. Pakistan has no conservation programme for the reptile.However, Choudhury advises caution about flooding the area with too many crocodiles since not all 185 km of the Beas river is ideal for the gharial.Romulus Whitaker, a conservationist, says follow-up is crucial when re-introducing such extinct species. “Whether such releases actually make a difference can only be judged in the years and decades after the release.” Initially, locals feared the gharials may attack them or their livestock. But Kuldeep Kumar says they were reassured that the gharial, unlike the mugger crocodile, does not attack people.At the moment, the major challenge facing the Beas Conservation Reserve is dams, which affect water flow into the fragile river ecosystem. “It is a highly altered river system caught between two dams. What we now see is a flow regulated by the dams upstream, which can cause huge fluctuations and affect habitats,” says WWF’s Suresh Babu.To resolve this, the Punjab government has set up a panel to develop a water flow regime. A report is expected in the next few months.A long-term plan for the conservation reserve is also being formulated, which will formalise permanent guidelines for the ecosystem, says Choudhury. Last September, the efforts were recognised globally when the reserve was named a Ramsar site under the 1971 Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. “It is a matter of pride. It shows the value given to this area,” says Babu.",Lease of life: The 185-km long Beas Conservation Reserve is helping protect many endangered aquatic species,https://news.google.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?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-74261008,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-897443,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg",2020-02-22,"{'sent': 'An Indus river Dolphin\n\nGharials, which disappeared from the river, have been reintroduced\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Indus'], 'PERSON': ['Dolphin']}}",Gharial

Rusty and Yuki, the Amur tiger cubs born and bred at Longleat, have caught attention across the country.

With their mother and father, Yana and Red, having been placed at Longleat as part of a Europe-wide breeding programme intended to help repopulate one of the most endangered species in the world, Rusty and Yuki have become part of the furniture at the park.

Born on June 17 2019, the cubs are now eight months old and growing fast.

They were shown to the public for the first time late last year, with mum Yana still very much in attendance.

Yana herself, who is now four years old, was brought into the park in 2018 alongside five-year-old Red, the male Amur tiger who keepers at Longleat think could be one of the biggest big cats in the world.

Keeper Caleb Hall said: ""Male Amur tigers are the biggest big cats on Earth, so if Red is fully grown and is as big as he is going to get he could be one of the biggest cats in the world.

""He is genuinely humongous - we think he's somewhere between two and a half to three metres long from the tip of his nose to the tail, and if he stands up on his back legs he could stand three metres tall.

""He's the biggest big cat we've got here, definitely bigger than the male lions.

""He weighs around 260 kilograms as well - he is a seriously big cat, and we think Rusty could be even bigger one day.""

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""They can be quite naughty sometimes - they're definitely a handful""

While Rusty and Yuki are only eight months old, they are growing very quickly.

Rusty, the male cub, is growing larger than the female Yuki and it is estimated he will rival his mother for size within a year and he will be comparable to his father when he is around four years old.

Yuki herself was weighed in at around 30kgs in December 2019 and keepers estimate she has doubled in size since.

The cubs are already starting to develop their own personalities and the keepers have observed a definite pattern in their behaviour that is mirrored in their parents.

Caleb said: ""They're cheeky little things - they can be quite naughty sometimes, they're definitely a handful.

""They're almost like kittens but they're the size of golden retrievers!

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""They've got the same reactions and instincts as kittens, the urges to swat at things, stalk and chase around, but they're the size of larger dogs.

""They're quite typical of their sex in a lot of ways - Rusty is almost identical to Red, he's got the same markings and stripes and behaviours, he carries the same mannerisms, he even runs the same way.

""Equally, Yuki is exactly like Yara, very sweet-natured, likes to stay clean and follows mum around, liking to watch what's going on rather than get involved - they are carbon copies of their parents.

""The problem is when they do play, Rusty is a lot bigger than Yuki already so he tends to win!

""Rusty just wants to play relentlessly - I think Yara is starting to get a little tired of playing with cubs after eight months if I'm honest, she's starting to ignore him a bit more.""

'If someone goes on holiday they barely recognise them when they come back'

The rate the cubs are growing is causing some excitement among the keepers.

The large appetites and fast growth is leading to a situation where a few days without seeing the cubs can leave a keeper surprised when they do return.

However, they still rely on their parents, as all children will do.

Caleb said: ""They don't stop eating and they don't stop growing.

""They grow amazingly quickly - if someone goes on holiday they are genuinely shocked to see them so much bigger when they come back.

""Rusty is probably already half as big as Yara and probably weighs 60kg.

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""They're growing and are definitely developing their own characters but they are still relying on mum to make big decisions.

""They're still relatively dependent on Yara at the moment but we're starting to see them having some more of their freedom around the paddock, they've got so much space so they can.

""Yara is a very good mum but they are her first cubs so she makes mistakes as any new parent does - she lets them get away with things here and there and maybe regrets it later.

""She was a very protective mum when they were young, but since they've come to about five months old she's been much less threatened by us keepers being around.

""Red still definitely does his part too. In the wild he would protect their area, so he goes in there at night and prowls around and they smell him there in the day - it makes them all a lot more comfortable when they know he's been somewhere.""

The future of the Amur tiger across Europe

The programme in which Longleat are involved stretches across Europe and may involve the resettlement of bred tigers in other locations to encourage breeding.

The species is being monitored across the centres and each cub, if it is intended to be bred from, will be matched up to a suitable mate in another location to ensure the protection of the best genes amongst the species.

The decisions on if and where Rusty and Yuki will be moved to and will breed will be made quite a way down the track, however, since the cubs are still very young.

Caleb said: ""We are given recommendations on how to move tigers around based on the best breeding options for them, we're not quite sure when this decision will be taken but it won't be any time soon.

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""There's no pressure on Longleat to move them, we've got plenty of space set up for them so it's about what's right for the species.

""To be honest, we didn't expect to have the cubs so early so it's great for us to have them at all.""

However, even though Rusty and Yuki will not be moved out of Longleat any time soon, they may have to be separated more within the park as time goes on.

Plenty of separate pens have been built already to accommodate them if needed and the increasing independence the cubs will start to develop may necessitate this separation.

Caleb said: ""When they get to the age in the wild that Yana would want them gone, we will start to separate them.

""They've got a big pen with plenty of space so it may only have to happen for feeding times initially, but as Rusty in particular gets close to his mother's size he may well start to dominate at feeding times and that sort of thing.

""By this stage they all eat separate chunks of meat now, as opposed to when they were younger and they would all share.

""They probably go through about 50kg of meat between the three of them in a week at the moment, but we could feed them every day and Rusty would still be hungry at the end of every day - he's got an insatiable appetite.

""He's like his dad that way - Red can go through 40 to 50kg of meat in one sitting if he wants to.""

'They're our pride and joy'

This is the first time in years Longleat has hosted tiger cubs and the keepers are aware of how big a deal this is.

The incredibly rare Amur Tiger was trying to cross a main road near Gogolevka village in the Primorsky Krai, a federal subject in the Far East region of Russia on the border of both China and North Korea. The bus driver reportedly had no way of avoiding the tiger cub.

A video caught the moment the endangered cub was hit. After it was hit, the cub got back up but was dazed and confused. The baby tiger then stumbled back into the woods. The driver reported the accident and a hunting patrol later found the tiger’s remains.

The animal is thought to have died from its injuries and was found to be aged just four or five months old. Sergey Aramilev, head of the Amur Tiger Centre dedicated to saving the threatened species, commented: “This is a truly tragic death of a tiger cub, and in this story there are a number of questions that are not yet answered. “The main one is why the tiger cub was alone on the road, without its mother, which at this age should always be there. “Experts of hunting supervision are now trying to get an answer to this and other questions.” READ MORE: Lethal two-headed cobra discovered which could kill 20 people

“It is truly a tragic set of circumstances: an accident occurred in the dark, this section of the road is not lit, and the cub jumped out in front of the bus at the most inopportune moment. “The driver did not have any chance to avoid the collision…the driver acted correctly, he avoided injuring passengers and almost saved the animal.” But experts are determined to find out the fate of the cub’s mother. “It is very important to understand what happened to the tigress,” he added. “In the best case, she is healthy and alive, and in the worst, some disaster happened to her, and the tiger cub, left alone, went on his last trip.

0,"The largest land mammal on the planet happens to also have the biggest brain and the longest gestation and life span of any creature, second only to humans. However, African elephants, also known as savanna elephants, may just boast the coolest body part, too – trunks!

Having a big nose has never been so handy.

In reality, their trunks are an extension of the upper lip but they serve the same uses as many body parts! Elephants use them as an arm, a hand, an extra foot, a shovel, a snorkel and oh, let’s not forget its role as a nose.

Did you know that an elephant can detect water from over 20 kilometres away? Astonishingly, adult elephants can go several days without water, however, once they find it, they can suck up as much as four gallons.

Imagine having a dangling appendage with 100,000 muscles that has the remarkable dexterity to pluck a berry or single piece of grass off the ground, yet is strong enough to pull a tree out by its roots!

Tissues on the elephant’s trunk are packed with nerve endings and considered by scientists to be the most sensitive tissue ever studied. Trunks can actually feel vibrations from the ground, sensing a far-off storm or the rumble of other herds in the distance.

In addition to all it can do physically, trunks are used to communicate – elephants use them when greeting or showing reassurance and affection.

This subspecies of elephant can be distinguished by its very large ears, which allow them to radiate excess heat. African elephants also have front legs that are longer than their back legs. Massive, these gentle giants reach up to 13 feet in height, weigh up to 11 tons and live up to 70 years.

African elephants are dispersed across eastern and southern Africa with high densities found in Tanzania, Kenya, Mozambique, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa. Herbivores, they will roam great distances in order to get their fill of daily vegetation. Consuming an astonishing 300+ pounds of food every day, they forage on a variety of plants, grasses, roots, fruit and bark.

Herds are led exclusively by females (cows), and all cues are taken from the eldest, called the matriarch. She determines and leads all family activities from eating and drinking, to where they roam and when. Drawing on her lifetime of experience, the matriarch recognizes and deals with immediate threats, leading her family away from danger, when necessary. It is said that families with older matriarchs tend to thrive and prosper.

Family units usually consist of around 10 females with mothers, grandmothers, sisters and aunts and their calves. Male elephants (bulls) are socially independent and generally live a solitary life, only approaching females during mating season.

Talk about a commitment! Elephants have a long pregnancy – the longest of any animal at almost 22 months. They give birth to one calf every two to four years. Learning the tricks of the trunk trade take baby elephants at least a year or more.

It is well known that elephants are highly intelligent, which may have something to do with those massive brains. They are capable of identifying human voices and languages, using tools, and recognizing themselves in a mirror. They also demonstrate empathy and take the loss of love ones very hard, often mourning their dead for extended periods.

What’s black and white and not all over? The answer, unfortunately, is the giant panda. While conservation efforts are underway, these cuddly creatures are facing serious problems in the wild. In honor of National Panda Day on March 16th, let’s take a look at the threats to these gentle giants, as well as learn some fascinating facts about them. Bonus: Adorable pics ahead!

The panda’s plight

Mainly because of habitat loss, there aren’t many giant pandas left in the world. That’s a common problem with many wild animal species you probably never realized were endangered. Other reasons the panda population is threatened: Illegal poaching for the black market remains a problem, pandas often have difficult pregnancies, and mother pandas only have enough milk to feed one cub, even though two or three cubs are often born at once. Plus, pandas are really picky in choosing a mate.

So, how dire is the situation? The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says there are just 1,864 pandas left in the wild. There are an additional 400 pandas in captivity, according to Pandas International. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the giant panda as “vulnerable,” which is the category between “near threatened” and “endangered.” However, there is some good news: The population has started to increase slightly, thanks to breeding programs in China.

Their home turf

All existing pandas come from the bamboo forests of central China, so it’s appropriate to greet them with nǐ hǎo (pronounced “nee haow”), which is how you say “hello” in Mandarin. Pandas also used to live in Laos, Myanmar/Burma, and Vietnam, according to Sciencing.com.

Giant pandas have their own language

Hung_Chung_Chih/Getty ImagesPandas won’t say “hello” back, of course, but scientists say they have more varied vocalizations than any other type of bear. The San Diego Zoo reports that pandas growl, huff, squeak, bark, honk, coo, tweet, and even bleat like lambs.

Pandas International describes a linguistics project by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. Researchers have figured out the meaning behind 13 different panda noises. They say that a mother panda will bark when a stranger approaches her cub and that male pandas baa like sheep when they’re in love. Supposedly, when a baby panda makes a “gee-gee” sound, it means “I’m hungry,” and “wow-wow” means the panda isn’t happy.

The perfect panda picnic

Giant pandas look a lot like teddy bears, especially when they sit down and stretch out their hind legs, a posture National Geographic says they like to use when eating. Speaking of which, a panda’s favorite meal is bamboo. In fact, these gentle giants rarely eat anything else and spend half of every day eating the fibrous stuff. However, bamboo isn’t the most nutritious of foods, especially for big animals like pandas. Bamboo is very low in protein, and the IUCN says pandas can digest less than 30 percent of it. A giant panda needs to eat between 25 and 40 pounds of bamboo daily, as well as have a sedentary lifestyle, to stay alive and healthy. Here are more panda facts that will make you love them even more.

Be glad you’re not a panda

Sure, it might seem like a nice life just to sit around all day and snack on your favorite food. But know that if you were a giant panda, you’d need to get off your couch and visit the bathroom a lot. According to the IUCN, a panda poops at least 100 times a day. Plus, when the bamboo in their territory is gone, pandas have to migrate to search for more.

Leave me alone!

Pascale Gueret/Getty ImagesPandas generally like to be by themselves. They do get together to mate in the spring and a mother will raise her cub until it’s 18 to 24 months old, but otherwise, pandas prefer to be alone with their bamboo. Interestingly enough, studies show that pandas “talk” when they do get together.

Here’s what we do know: Pandas rely on their excellent sense of smell to help avoid one another, says National Geographic. They also use smell to find a mate when they’re ready to have a break from all of that alone time.

Why do pandas do handstands?

While pandas generally prefer to sit around by themselves and eat, they can sometimes be seen doing acrobatics. Pandas mark their territories to tell other pandas who they are and to stay away. Their scent gland is underneath their tails, and they rub this area on trees. In order to get the mark as high as possible on a tree (showing that they’re a great big panda that other pandas should avoid), pandas will do a handstand. Plus, adds LiveScience.com, pandas like to hang in trees and do somersaults when they play.

Are they bears, or aren’t they?

Before scientists were able to test panda DNA, they thought that giant pandas might be part of the raccoon family, another animal that has black markings around its eyes. But it is now confirmed that the panda is part of the bear family. That’s unlike the koala bear, which isn’t a bear at all. It is, however, one of these 11 animals with surprisingly misleading names.

Pandas are different from bears in many ways. They don’t store fat and hibernate like their North American bear cousins. They have an extra-long wrist bone that acts like a thumb to make it easier to hold onto bamboo. And technically, the giant panda is classified as a carnivore. Even though they mostly eat bamboo, they will also occasionally eat fish, rats, and other small animals.

And here’s another fun animal comparison: In Mandarin, the name of the giant panda translates as “giant bear cat,” perhaps because of their cat-like vertical pupils or maybe because they like to lie around all day like cats.

The size of a stick of butter

John Moore/Getty ImagesGiant pandas are truly giant when fully grown—males weigh about 300 pounds. But the WWF reports that panda newborns are 1/900th the size of their mamas. They weigh four to six ounces at birth, approximately the same size and weight as a stick of butter in your fridge. When they’re born, baby giant pandas are tiny, pale, and hairless. They only get their distinctive black and white fur when they’re about a month old. Here are some adorable pictures of baby animals you’ll love instantly.

Living fossils

Pandas International calls giant pandas “living fossils” because the species is thought to have existed for three million years. In order to prevent pandas from going extinct, we need to protect the animals and their habitat, as well as help them reproduce in panda breeding centers. So much of the world’s wildlife is at risk and in need of protection—for example, do you know how many cheetahs are left in the world?

How to help giant pandas

Donating to animal conservation organizations like the WWF is a great way to help pandas and to prevent their populations from shrinking. With the WWF, you can even adopt a panda. Pandas are particularly important to the WWF—the group has used the panda as its logo since it was founded in 1961.

Another simple way you can help? By visiting a panda in a zoo. China leases pandas to zoos around the world and uses the funds to preserve pandas in the wild. In China, you can see newborn, baby, and adult pandas at panda centers such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. In the United States, you can see giant pandas at the Memphis Zoo, at the Atlanta Fulton County Zoo, at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute in Washington D.C., and, in Canada, at the Calgary Zoo.

Koshi Tappu is the only wildlife reserve in Nepal that is situated in the eastern lowlands. It is also the first Ramsar site of Nepal, which was designated in 1976. The Koshi was made a reserve for conserving the only remaining population of the wild water buffalo, the Arna. The Koshi Tappu, which spreads over 175 square kilometers, covers Saptari, Sunsari and Udayapur districts. The reserve lies in the Sapta Koshi floodplains, with the Koshi River flowing through the middle of the reserve.

The river is a good habitat for critically endangered grassland birds as well as wetland migratory birds. Apart from wild animals, the Ganges River dolphin can also be spotted in the Koshi River.

In 2018-19, I along with two of my colleagues surveyed the eastern wetlands of Koshi for a year for our master’s thesis under a grant provided by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Australia and Himalayan Nature. We visited the Koshi in four different seasons.

During the survey, we also managed to visit the marketplace and learn about the dependency of the locals on the reserve and wetlands.

People in Koshi mostly depend on the reserve for various types of resources, like fish, fodder, seasonal fruits and vegetables. During our study, we saw numerous local methods of fishing in the area. The reserve is rich in ningro, young shoots of the edible fern, which is cooked as a vegetable, and is sold aplenty in the market.

Seasonal fruits like custard apple, Chinese date and jungle jalebi are also consumed by the locals from the reserve. The women living in the buffer zone use the reed that grows here for weaving mats and also for fodder, too.

It usually takes two days to weave a mat from the reed, which sells for Rs 250 in the local market. This has definitely improved the livelihood of women in the area.

The reserve also allows people to collect the tall ‘khar’ grass from the reserve. The people of the buffer zone are allowed to enter the reserve for a nominal fee and collect the khar grass, which is mostly used to thatch roofs.

While the locals benefit from the reserve, they face constant attacks from the wildlife elephant and Arna that enter their fields and villages.

There is an electric fence around the reserve, but the elephant manages to get through it and enter the village, damaging crop and property.

0,"Fishing operations in the Indian Ocean have decimated dolphin populations over the last 70 years, according to a new study published in the journal Endangered Species Research.

The fishing operations that have had dolphins swept up as bycatch have meant that nearly 4 million dolphins have died since 1950 and the population of dolphins in the Indian Ocean has declined by nearly 80 percent, as The Guardian reported. Those numbers just represent the dolphins killed directly as bycatch of drifting nets that trail behind large fishing boats and do not represent the number of dolphins, porpoises or whales killed by floating ghost nets, harpoons, other types of tuna fishing or animals that are injured and succumb to their wounds later. That means the actual number of dolphins killed from commercial fishing may actually be much higher, according to the study.

Looking at driftnets, which account for just over one-third of Indian Ocean commercial fisheries, the researchers were able to calculate that the number of dolphins, porpoises, and whales killed directly each year as bycatch peaked at around 100,000 from 2004 to 2006. That number has come down slightly and is now around 85,000 cetaceans annually, according to the study. Unfortunately, the authors do not believe the decline in bycatch is the result of improved practices, which are essentially unregulated. Instead, they believe it reflects the declining dolphin population, according to The Guardian.

The study's lead author, Charles Anderson of the Manta Marine organization in the Maldives, estimated that the dolphin numbers had probably dropped to only 13 percent their pre-1980 levels, which is when large-scale tuna fishing in the Indian Ocean began, as The Guardian reported. ""Declining cetacean bycatch rates suggest that such levels of mortality are not sustainable,"" the study says. ""Indeed, mean small cetacean abundance may currently be 13 percent of pre-fishery levels. None of these estimates are precise, but they do demonstrate the likely order of magnitude of the issue.""

There are many limitations in obtaining the exact number of mammal deaths due to bycatch, one of the study's author's told The Guardian, especially considering that most dolphins caught up in driftnets were not registered and were likely tossed over the side of the boat. These types of nets also snare turtles, whales and sharks. The researcher, Puti Liza Mustika, from James Cook University's College of Business, Law and Governance, clarified that most of the bycatch was dolphins and that there was some reliable data from observers on boats and from previous studies. However, as a researcher, some clearer numbers would be helpful. ""That bycatch number is alarming, but there are a lot of uncertainties because the datasets are insufficient,"" Mustika told The Guardian.",Indian Ocean Dolphin Population Plummets Due to Commercial Fishing,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3dhdGNoLmNvbS9kb3BoaW4tcG9wdWxhdGlvbi1pbmRpYW4tb2NlYW4tZmlzaGluZy0yNjQ1MzY5NDk0Lmh0bWzSAU5odHRwczovL3d3dy5lY293YXRjaC5jb20vYW1wL2RvcGhpbi1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWluZGlhbi1vY2Vhbi1maXNoaW5nLTI2NDUzNjk0OTQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMjg0MDA2MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYxNjExMDA0OH0.Gi-Oj-m352kXRzlL7CoLmyTZjufxq3-Z2Km7oUCcjIQ/img.jpg?width=1200&coordinates=0%2C37%2C0%2C37&height=600,2020-03-03,"{'sent': 'Fishing operations in the Indian Ocean have decimated dolphin populations over the last 70 years, according to a new study published in the journal Endangered Species Research.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the journal Endangered Species Research']}}",Indus River Dolphin

National Chambal sanctuary has been declared as an eco-sensitive zone by the central government. The decision to declare the area as an eco-sensitive zone will prohibit the construction of hotels or resorts within an area of zero to two kilometres from the sanctuary, according to a report by PTI.

The government has notified area to an extent of zero to two kilometre around the Chambal sanctuary as the national chambal sanctuary eco-sensitive zone, according to a notification issued by the government.

The sanctuary based in the Chambal region is a host of a lot of critically endangered species. Gangetic dolphins, gharial and freshwater turtles are among the major species found in the region. More than 75 per cent of the critically endangered Gharial population is based in the sanctuary.

The central government has also asked the Madhya Pradesh government to work on a Zonal master plan for the area. The state government has been tasked with restoring the water bodies in the region, soil conservation and watershed management under the Zonal master plan.

The National Chambal Sanctuary is spread in three districts of Madhya Pradesh i.e, Sheopur, Morena and Bhind district- which constitute the Chambal region in the state. The sanctuary is spread over an area of 435 sq km across the three districts.

With the declaration of the eco-sensitive zone, the commercial establishments will be forbidden to construct hotels or resorts in the region which will help maintain distance between the human settlement and the sanctuary. The development of human settlement in close vicinity of the forests and sanctuaries has proved detrimental to the growth of the wildlife. It has also led to the wildlife entering the human settlement leading to panic among the people.

The new establishments will only be allowed in the pre-defined area for eco-tourism as per the Tourism Master Plan beyond the distance of one kilometre from the wildlife sanctuary till the extent of the eco-sensitive zone, the government notification said.","National Chambal sanctuary, home of gharials and Gangetic dolphins, declared eco-sensitive zone",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG8Os5GCNg3ilcN6ytaVZ9kqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow55veCjDzvdUBMLHh5gU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images.financialexpress.com/2020/03/chambal-l.jpg,2020-03-03,"{'sent': 'National Chambal sanctuary has been declared as an eco-sensitive zone by the central government.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['National Chambal']}}",Gharial

In an effort to curb further spread of the deadly Coronavirus, China has temporarily banned the sale of wildlife.

The virus outbreak that has killed 56 people in China has been traced to a market that sells wildlife.

NGOs have embraced the move, and are calling for it to be made permanent.

This comes as China prepares to host the 2020 Convention on Biological Diversity, a major conservation congress that aims to curb the current extinction crisis, in October.

In May 2019, some 200 representatives from 16 different ethnicities gathered for the first women’s summit in the Xingu Indigenous Territory’s in the state of Mato Grosso. Feeling under threat from policies regarding native peoples under the Jair Bolsonaro administration and tired of their community roles being restricted to domestic tasks, the women met to discuss ways to occupy leadership roles alongside men and, in doing so, gain strength to protect their territory.

Even though many men in the Xingu still disapprove of female empowerment, the event itself already led to changes in local gender relationships: During the summit, some domestic partners took responsibility for household tasks and childcare while the women were away. In the village where the event was held, the men took over traditional female jobs like collecting food, fishing and cooking for the hundreds of women present.

This is a particularly delicate time in the region: 147 square kilometers (57.8 square miles) of the forest were destroyed in the Xingu Socio-environmental Biodiversity Corridor between July and August 2019 — 172% more than occurred during the same period last year. A mosaic composed of 21 indigenous reserves and nine conservation units, the corridor is home to one of Earth’s largest concentrations of environmental diversity.

A plan to plant 2.42 billion trees by the Isha Foundation along the Cauvery River has attracted the chagrin of some scientists.

While scientists say the project is well-meaning, they don’t believe it will cure the Cauvery River’s ills as promised.

The Isha Foundation has yet to announce a number of details of the project, including what tree species will be planted.

India’s rivers are suffering from numerous issues, but researchers contend mass tree planting is too simplistic to fix them all.

In 2013, during the building of the Teles Pires dam in the Brazilian Amazon, the Teles Pires Hydroelectric Company (CHTP) dynamited Karobixexe (Seven Rapids), a sacred site of the Munduruku, Apiaká and Kayabi peoples. Located just outside an indigenous reserve, it received no government protection.

Also during construction, the firm removed funeral urns from a sacred site without indigenous permission and refused to return them. In December, 70 Munduruku occupied the Natural History Museum in Alta Floresta in Mato Grosso state, and took back the 12 funeral urns, plus other artifacts of theirs.

The construction of the Teles Pires dam and destruction of Karobixexe both occurred without prior consultation of the Mundurku as required under law according to the International Labor Organization’s Convention 169, of which Brazil is a signatory.

Other human remains were found by CHTP and 270,000 artifacts were removed to which the Munduruku now have no access. They have also been barred from another sacred site, Dekoka’a (Monkey Hill) impacted by the construction of the São Manoel Hydroelectric Power Station, also located on the Teles Pires River.

Officially established in October 2014, Argentina’s Impenetrable National Park partially opened to the public in early 2018.

The park is home to an estimated 600 species of vertebrates including jaguars and giant anteaters. Conservation organizations and Argentina’s National Parks Administration are planning on reintroducing marsh deer to the park, which have been driven to local extinction in most of their Argentinian range.

Impenetrable National Park is located in the largely semiarid Gran Chaco ecoregion. The Chaco is one of the most deforested areas on the planet, losing more than 2.9 million hectares (7.2 million acres) of its forest between 2010 and 2018. Argentina is home to 60% of the Chaco – but it’s the site of 80% of Chaco deforestation as farmers clear more and more land for cattle and soy.

Park officials say hunting is also taking a toll on wildlife, and satellite imagery reveals wildfire burned through more than 1,000 hectares of park forest in late 2019.

The village of Bule is believed to be the birthplace of traditional “home garden” agroforestry in Ethiopia.

Farmers here practice this ancient multi-storied agroforestry system — the growing of trees, shrubs and annual crops together in a forest-mimicking system — around their homesteads, hence the name home garden.

Trees provide fruit, timber, fodder or soil-building properties and shade for mid-story crops like coffee and enset, with vegetable and medicinal herbs growing on the forest floor.

Farm families are more food secure, because the system provides economic, ecological and environmental attributes and provide year-round and marketable harvests.

The Brazilian Cerrado, the world’s largest tropical savanna, is a biodiversity hotspot with thousands of unique species and is home to 5 percent of the world’s biodiversity.

However, half of the Cerrado has already been converted to agriculture; much of it is now growing soy which is exported abroad, particularly to the European Union (EU) and China, primarily as animal feed. But tracing soy-driven biodiversity and species losses to specific commodities traders and importing nations is challenging.

Now a new groundbreaking study published in the journal PNAS has modeled the biodiversity impacts of site-specific soy production, while also linking specific habitat losses and species losses to nations and traders.

For example, the research found that the consumption of Brazilian soy by EU countries has been especially detrimental to the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), which has lost 85 percent of its habitat to soy in the state of Mato Grosso.

Identifying the feeding habits and foraging preferences of pangolins is key to informing Sri Lanka’s pangolin conservation efforts, a new study says.

It shows that forests are the preferred foraging sites for the island’s endangered Indian pangolins, and that rubber plantations come second.

With forests shrinking, policymakers should consider maintaining rubber plantations and similar preferred foraging habitats for long-term pangolin conservation, the study’s authors say.

The study also identifies termites rather than ants as pangolins’ favorite food — a finding with lessons for rescue and captive-breeding centers that currently serve pangolins an artificial diet short on natural feeds.

In Nepal, fewer than 100 mature adult gharials are estimated to remain, with only one population in the Narayani and Rapti Rivers of Chitwan National Park known to be breeding until recently.

Now, researchers have recorded nesting sites and more than 100 gharial babies in yet another site, in Bardia National Park in southwest Nepal.

The last time gharials were recorded breeding in Bardia was in 1982.

Tommy Apriando, an esteemed investigative journalist and chairperson of the Yogyakarta branch of Indonesia’s Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI), died Sunday at the age of 30 after being hospitalized for complications from diabetes.

In a country where environmental reporting is potentially deadly, Apriando wasn’t afraid to speak truth to power. He took on politicians who used their connections with oligarchs to enrich themselves, exposed abuses by mining and palm oil companies, and told the complex stories that underpin entrenched land conflicts.

Apriando won deep respect from his peers for his courageous reporting, which regularly appeared on Mongabay, China Dialogue, The Pangolin Reports, and The Wire. In 2019, he was elected to lead AJI in Yogyakarta, where he was an outspoken advocate for press freedom and the welfare of other journalists.

Apriando is survived by his wife, Wiwid Ervita, his mother, Jamsiah, and his younger sister, Dwi Unzirzam.

World Wetlands Day was recently held on the 2nd February 2020, with the theme of ‘wetlands and biodiversity’. It is quite difficult to define a wetland, but the standard definition, as put out by the Ramsar Convention, states, “areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six metres (Ramsar Convention, 1971)”. This broad definition usually encompasses coastal wetlands, freshwater swamps and marshes, floodplains, and peatlands as distinct types of wetland ecosystems.

In coastal areas, many wetlands are found in estuaries, which are water bodies typically found where rivers meet the sea. Habitats associated with the brackish water of estuaries include salt marshes, mangrove forests, mudflats, tidal streams, rocky inter-tidal shores, reefs, and barrier islands and beaches.

In the month of January 2020, PIB in its press release announced that 10 more wetlands have been added, taking the total number of Ramsar sites in the country to 37. Maharashtra got its first Ramsar site, and Punjab got three more Ramsar sites in addition to the existing three. Uttar Pradesh, which only had one Ramsar site earlier, got six more wetlands under the said Convention.

The following wetlands are the new Ramsar sites:

Nandur Madhameshwar bird sanctuary- It is located in the Nasik district of Maharashtra. It has an area of 14 km2 and houses a wide range of species in contrast to the semi-arid conditions, caused by the rain-shadow zone of the Western Ghats. It was designated on 21st June 2019. Keshopur-Miani community reserve- It is located in Gurdaspur, Punjab, with an area of 34 Km2. It lies in the middle of Ravi and Beas rivers and is a community managed wetland. A favourite spot for migratory birds, the techniques of participatory management and joint forest management have shown impeccable results. It was designated a wetland on 26th September 2019. Beas Conservation Reserve- It is located in Punjab and is a 185 km2 stretch of Beas River starting from the Harike headworks to Talwara Conservation Reserve. It is also known for housing the endangered Indus river dolphin. It has successfully reintroduced the critically endangered Gharials, which otherwise are more popular in the ravines of Chambal. It was designated on 26th September 2019. Nangal wildlife sanctuary- It is located in Roopnagar district in Punjab near the Sutlej River. It has a very small area of just one km2 and is a site for many residents as well as migratory birds. An extremely eco-sensitive zone, it also houses threatened species like the Indian Pangolin adding to its conservation efforts. It was designated on 26th September 2019. Nawabganj bird sanctuary- Also known as the Chandrashekhar Azad Bird Sanctuary, it is located in the Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh. It has an area of only two Km2. This particular wetland is famous for a wide range of birds, both resident and migratory, and is a site loved by conservationists. An ideal spot for bird-watching, the sanctuary was designated on 19th September 2019. Parvati Agra bird sanctuary- It is located in the Gonda district of UP. It consists of two oxbow lakes and has an area of seven km2. It is a potential site for developing eco-tourism, as it is a haven for a wide range of bird species especially some of India’s threatened Vulture species. It was designated on 2nd December 2019. Saman bird sanctuary- It is located in the Mainpuri district of UP and is a seasonal oxbow lake, which means its existence depends on the south-west monsoon. Another popular bird conservation site, it has an area of five Km2. It was designated on 2nd December 2019. Samaspur bird sanctuary- It is located in the Raebareli district of UP and is a perennial low lying marsh of the Indo-Gangetic plains. It has an area of eight Km2 and houses different species of migratory and resident birds. It is heavily dependent on the monsoons. The agriculture department and the forest department (wildlife) have worked in close association for its conservation efforts. It was designated on 3rd October 2019. Sandi bird sanctuary- It is a freshwater marsh located in the Hardoi district of UP. A haven for birds, it has a very small are of three Km2 and has been listed as an ‘important bird area’ by BirdLife International. It was designated on 26th September 2019. Sarsai Nawar Jheel/ Lake- Located in Etawah district of UP, the lake is a typical Indo-Gangetic wetland fed by the water of SW monsoon. It has an area of two Km2 and is another bird haven famous for housing a large number of Sarus Cranes – the world’s tallest flying birds. This has also been recognised as an ‘important bird area’ by BirdLife International. It was designated on 19th September 2019.

Wetlands are extremely important as they provide a wide range of ecosystem services, which are provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural. Conserving such wetlands will also lead to conserving many other indicator species, which would eventually determine the health of the wetlands. One such species is ‘dragonfly’, which indicates how clean a wetland is.","With More Wetlands This Year, India Is Saving The Planet 10 Steps At A Time",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlvdXRoa2lhd2Fhei5jb20vMjAyMC8wMy90ZW4tbmV3LXJhbXNhci13ZXRsYW5kcy1pbi1pbmRpYS_SAUpodHRwczovL3d3dy55b3V0aGtpYXdhYXouY29tLzIwMjAvMDMvdGVuLW5ldy1yYW1zYXItd2V0bGFuZHMtaW4taW5kaWEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://dz01iyojmxk8t.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/06122558/Untitled-design-64.jpg,2020-03-06,"{'sent': '#WhyOnEarth aims to take the truth to the people with stories, experiences, opinions and revelations about the climate', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['WhyOnEarth']}}",Indus River Dolphin

It goes without saying that both giant and red pandas are incredibly charismatic and intelligent. Today and every day, we encourage them to keep physically active and mentally sharp by presenting them with a variety of enrichment. This can be anything from sensory experiences (like spices for scent-anointing or a tub full of bubbles for popping), to physical objects and toys (like boomer balls and puzzle feeders), to social interactions (like husbandry training sessions or painting with keepers) and environmental stimuli (like giving them access to a different yard or adding new groundcover to explore).

0,"A team of reproductive scientists, veterinarians and panda keepers at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute performed an artificial insemination on giant panda Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) yesterday morning, March 22, at 9:45 a.m.

Scientists and keepers had been closely monitoring Mei Xiang’s behavior and hormones since she began displaying behavioral changes March 12, indicating she was entering her breeding season. Hormone analyses determined Mei Xiang’s urinary estrogen concentrations also began to increase on the 12th, meaning she was within a week or so of ovulating and able to become pregnant. Female giant pandas are only in estrus, or able to become pregnant, for 24 to 72 hours each year.

Since the window when a giant panda can conceive a cub is so short, the Zoo’s panda team performed an artificial insemination on Mei Xiang. They artificially inseminated her using frozen semen from Tian Tian (t-YEN t-YEN) for the procedure.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” said Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. “Our team carefully planned this procedure with the safety of staff and Mei Xiang as the number one priority, taking extra precautions due to COVID-19.”

During the past week, Mei Xiang became increasingly restless, wandering her yard, scent-marking, vocalizing and playing in water—all behaviors that increase in intensity before she reaches peak estrus. Tian Tian immediately noticed the hormonal changes in Mei Xiang and began displaying behaviors toward her indicating he was ready to breed. He vocalized to her and constantly tried to keep her in his sight for the past week. During the past few days, he spent much of his time at the “howdy window” that separates their yards. Mei Xiang did not respond positively to any of Tian Tian’s vocalizations until yesterday.

As Mei Xiang exhibited estrus behaviors, the Zoo received approval for its breeding plans from the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which monitors giant panda research programs in the United States. Mei Xiang is 21 and near the end of her reproductive life cycle, but there are pandas who have had cubs when they were older than she is now. Based on data from scientists in China and other zoos with pandas, females can breed into their early 20s.

As a public health precaution due to COVID-19, the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is temporarily closed to the public. Special precautions implemented to minimize person to person contact ahead of Mei Xiang’s artificial insemination included delivering medical supplies and setting up equipment in advance, as well as, limiting the number of staff present during the insemination event. Per usual procedures, the Zoo’s expert team of panda keepers closely watched Mei Xiang’s behavior, which is the best indicator, in addition to hormone analysis, that she has reached peak ovulation. These behaviors include an increase in positive vocalizations like bleats and chirps and walking backward with her tail up. Historically this behavior has tracked with peak estrogen and progesterone rise. Due to the successful banking of semen from Tian Tian over the past several years as part of the Smithsonian’s cryopreservation initiative, the team used frozen semen instead of fresh to reduce overall staff contact time and work load in consideration of the needs of staff and the other animals in the collection.

The Zoo’s webcams, including the giant panda webcam, remain online, but volunteers are not operating them, so animals may not be visible at all times.

The panda team will not know if the artificial insemination was successful for several months. Giant panda pregnancies and pseudopregnancies generally last between three to six months. Veterinarians will conduct ultrasounds to track changes in Mei Xiang’s reproductive tract and determine if she is pregnant during the next several months. Scientists will also monitor her hormones to determine when she is near the end of a pseudopregnancy or pregnancy. There is no way to determine if a female is pregnant by hormone analysis and behavior alone. Mei Xiang’s hormones and behavior will mimic a pregnancy even if she is experiencing a pseudopregnancy. The only definitive way to determine if she is pregnant before giving birth is to see a developing fetus on an ultrasound.

Giant pandas are listed as “vulnerable” in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are an estimated 1,800 in the wild. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is a leader in giant panda conservation. Ever since these charismatic bears arrived at the Zoo in 1972, animal care staff and scientists have studied giant panda biology, behavior, breeding, reproduction and disease. These experts are also leading ecology studies in giant pandas’ native habitat. The Zoo’s giant panda team works closely with colleagues in China to advance conservation efforts around the world. Chinese scientists are working to reintroduce giant pandas to the wild.

The Zoo’s giant Panda reproduction research collaboration contract with the China Wildlife Conservation Association expires Dec. 7. The Zoo is in the process of renewing this agreement.

As of March 12, Mei Xiang started to show behavioral changes — becoming extremely restless, wandering her yard, scent-marking, vocalizing and playing in water –, which indicated that she was entering her breeding season. Scientists and keepers have been monitoring her closely since that date.

They also determined that urinary estrogen concentrations began to increase on the same day, a sign she was about to ovulate.

Female giant pandas are only able to become pregnant for 24 to 72 hours each year after entering this phase, according to the Zoo’s statement, which is the reason why the team had to perform the insemination immediately. Even though Mei Xiang is 21, it is known that females can breed into their early 20s.

For the operation, the team used frozen semen from Tian Tian, who actually noticed the hormonal changes in Mei Xiang and tried to get her attention, showing he was also ready to breed. Mei Xiang, on the other hand, did not respond to his vocalizations until Saturday.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, was quoted as saying in the statement.

“Our team carefully planned this procedure with the safety of staff and Mei Xiang as the number one priority, taking extra precautions due to COVID-19.”

Some exciting news for animal lovers: Giant panda Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated over the weekend at the Smithsonian National Zoo! The procedure was performed on Sunday, March 22, after the beloved panda began exhibiting behaviors common with ovulation. Considering female pandas only conceive during a single 24-72 hour period during the year, this marks a huge moment for panda conservation, as reflected in the successful breeding program between China and the United States.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for, and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,"" said Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars Director, Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, said in an official press release.

Having occurred amidst the coronavirus pandemic, zoo staff took necessary measures in protecting themselves and the people around them during the procedure. They also used frozen semen from Tian Tian, which the zoo has collected through the years.

Mei Xiang started displaying signs signaling she was ready to breed on March 12, with the giant panda marking her scent throughout the habitat and playing with her water. She also responded to courtship behaviors by the zoo's panda patriarch, Tian Tian. The male giant panda also fathered Bao Bao and Bei Bei, who have both been transferred to China (Bei Bei left in 2019). Panda breeding season typically begins in March and runs until May, so it seems Mei Xiang is right on schedule!

So when will we know she's pregnant? Female pandas can experience a ""pseudopregnancy,"" which means they can display similar behaviors of pregnancy without actually being pregnant. Both pregnancies and pseudopregnancies last between 3-6 months, so experts won't know her status until they conduct an ultrasound. In the meantime, we'll be waiting by the Panda Cam!

She’s back! Well, her voice is back. On April 3, Disney will be releasing a thrilling nature documentary, Elephant, which revolves around an elephant family as they trek through the Kalahari Desert for hundreds and hundreds of miles — all so they can finally experience the joy of not luxuriating in a desert. It’s heartwarming, a little sad at times, and definitely great for families who are currently trapped in their homes. It’s also a return to form for Meghan Markle’s acting career and marks her first Hollywood role since her engagement to Prince Harry back in 2017. Markle narrates the entire 90-minute doc, for which Disney donated a sizable amount of money to her charity of choice.

Vulture’s Elephant highlight, without getting too much into the details, is when Markle is forced to narrate a moment when a baby elephant goes on a farting spree while playing in the mud. “Oh, dear,” she coos. “Ah, who did that?” Some other line readings you can look forward to are the following:

“It’s time for an elephant feast!” “The mud has a dark side.” “That’s a crocodile! Probably best to stick with the herd.” “The death of a matriarch is a momentous event in his young life.” “A little extra protein never hurt anyone.” “She has her hands full trying to raise her 1-year-old son. And this kid is a handful.”

0,"Netflix’s recent documentary miniseries Tiger King has wild animals, ex-felons, a brief presidential campaign, polygamy, a murder-for-hire plot, and a huge cast of eccentric characters. It follows Joseph Maldonado-Passage, better known as “Joe Exotic,” the owner of Oklahoma’s Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, which was, in its heyday, a prominent cub-petting, tiger-breeding operation and private zoo. Now Maldonado-Passage is serving 22 years in prison for plotting to have a critic murdered, killing five tigers, and illegally selling tigers across state lines.

Because the series is character-driven, it doesn’t spend a lot of time on the animal welfare and trade issues that surround the captive-tiger breeding industry. Exotic pets, captive wildlife, the illegal wildlife trade, and even Joe Exotic are topics National Geographic routinely covers, so here’s some contextual information.

Is tiger breeding conservation?

Some private tiger breeders argue that they’re helping shore up tigers, which are endangered in the wild. But their cats will never be released into the wild, both because they wouldn’t know how to fend for themselves and because of their genetics. There are multiple subspecies of tigers in the wild, each adapted to live in a certain part of the world. A Bengal tiger is not a Siberian tiger is not a Sumatran tiger. Most privately owned tigers in the U.S. are of mixed or unknown lineage and therefore are excluded from participating in captive-breeding efforts at accredited zoos and institutions that seek to preserve the subspecies.

What makes a good sanctuary or zoo?

According to the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries, an accrediting organization, a true sanctuary exists to provide lifetime care to animals that have been abused, neglected, discarded, or are otherwise in need of help. A true sanctuary does not breed or allow hands-on interactions with animals, and it maintains high standards of care and operation.

For zoos in the U.S., accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums requires facilities to go above and beyond the basic requirements set by the government in terms of animal health, welfare, guest education, safety, recordkeeping, and more. Conservation is typically promoted as an important part of a zoo’s mission. (Many other countries have accrediting organizations too.)



“Pseudo-sanctuaries” and “roadside zoos” are loose terms that describe unaccredited facilities with low, or at least problematic, standards of operation and care.

What’s the deal with cub petting?

It’s easy to understand the impulse to want to play with an adorable tiger cub. But did you ever wonder why a facility seems to always have them? Or what happens when they’re not cute and tiny anymore?

Cub-petting facilities often speed-breed their tigers so there’s a constant supply, National Geographic reported in December. As soon as a litter is born, the cubs are removed from the mother, making her go into heat sooner so she can breed again.

View Images An endangered Sumatran tiger watches over her playful cubs at Zoo Atlanta.

Interacting with humans is also stressful for cubs. They’re very young; they’re not with their mother; and they’re being passed around amid bright lights, noise, and milling people that, to their tiny selves, could be predators.

Cubs are only economically (and legally) useful for a short time—eight weeks to 12 weeks old. They quickly get too dangerous to interact with visitors. They may become breeders themselves, or go on exhibit. There’s evidence that some are killed.

What's up with the ligers?

Cross-bred species abound in private zoos and menageries. In the wild, lion-tiger hybrids such as ligers and tigons don’t exist. In fact, the lions and tigers live in separate parts of the world. Cross-breeding species can cause genetic defects and health problems, according to Luke Hunter, a big cat scientist and conservationist, who talked to National Geographic in 2017 about big cat hybrids.

White tigers aren’t hybrids, but they’re not exactly natural, either—at least, not in the numbers we see in captivity. They’re simply tigers with white fur, and they’re rarely found in the wild. Intensive inbreeding to create and sell white tigers over the years means some suffer congenital defects that require lifetime care, wrote AZA CEO Dan Ashe in a recent post.

How can I tell if the tigers are well cared for?

If you’re thinking about visiting a sanctuary or zoo, here are some tips to help you identify ethical and responsible places. Tigers are big, nocturnal, solitary animals, and that means they have some special needs in captivity, according to graduate research by Leigh Pitsko, now at Smithsonian’s National Zoo. They need space to exercise, and they shouldn’t be crowded with other tigers. They need a place to hide if they’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed by human visitors, and they should always have access to shade and water. Toys, activities, and climbing equipment are important for keeping tigers’ brains active, and enclosures with natural flooring substances, not concrete, are important not only for the health of their feet and skin but also for their well-being. The more natural their enclosure, the better.

0,"Editor’s note: Netflix’s new docuseries “Tiger King” takes viewers into the strange world of big cat collectors. Featuring eccentric characters with names like Joe Exotic and Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, the series touches on polygamy, addiction and personality cults, while exploring a mysterious disappearance and a murder-for-hire.

To Allison Skidmore, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies wildlife trafficking, the documentary didn’t bring enough attention to the scourge of captive big cats.

A former park ranger, Skidmore first started studying the issue in the U.S. after the infamous death of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe in 2015. She was shocked to learn about how little oversight there was stateside. We asked her about the legality, incentives and ease of buying and selling tigers.

1. How many captive tigers are in the US?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer. The vast majority of captive tigers are crossbred hybrids, so they aren’t identified as members of one of the six tiger subspecies – the Bengal tiger, Amur tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger and Malayan tiger. Instead, they’re classified as “generic.”

Less than 5% – or fewer than 350 – of tigers in captivity are managed through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a nonprofit organization that serves as an accrediting body in the U.S. They ensure accredited facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by law.

All the rest are privately owned tigers, meaning they don’t belong to one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ 236 sponsored institutions. These are considered generic and fall outside of federal oversight.

There’s no legal requirement to register these generic tigers, nor a comprehensive national database to track and monitor them. The best educated guess puts the number of tigers at around 10,000 in the U.S. Estimates put the global captive tiger population as high as 25,000.

In comparison, there are fewer than 4,000 tigers in the wild – down from 100,000 a century ago.

2. How do tigers change hands?

The Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna prevent the importation of tigers from the wild. So all tigers in the U.S. are born in captivity, with the rare exception of an orphaned wild cub that may end up in a zoo.

Only purebred tigers that are one of the six definitive subspecies are accounted for; these are the tigers you see in places like the Smithsonian National Zoo and generally belong to the Species Survival Plan, a captive breeding program designed to regulate the exchange of specific endangered species between member zoos in order to maintain genetic diversity.

All other tigers are found in zoos, sanctuaries, carnivals, wildlife parks, exhibits and private homes that aren’t sanctioned by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They can change hands in any number of ways, from online marketplaces to exotic animal auctions. They can be bought for as little as US$800 to $2,000 for a cub and $200 to $500 for an adult, which is less expensive than many purebred dog puppies.

3. Can I legally buy a tiger?

The U.S. is plagued with complicated and vague laws concerning tiger ownership.

However, there are no federal statutes or regulations that expressly forbid private ownership of tigers. State and local jurisdictions have been given this authority, and some do pass bans or require permits. Thirty-two states have bans or partial bans, and 14 states allow ownership with a simple license or permit. Four states – Alabama, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Nevada – have no form of oversight or regulation at all.

An overarching, cohesive framework of regulations is missing, and even in states that ban private ownership, there are loopholes. For example, in all but three states, owners can apply for what’s called a “federal exhibitor license,” which is remarkably cheap and easy to obtain and circumvents any stricter state or local laws in place.

You now need a permit to transport tigers across state lines, but there’s still no permit required for intra-state travel.

4. What’s in it for the owners?

Some see it as a business venture, while others claim they care about conservation. I consider the latter reason insincere.

Many facilities promote themselves as wildlife refuges or sanctuaries. These places frame their breeding and exhibition practices as stewardship, as if they’re contributing to an endangered animal’s survival. The reality is that no captive tiger has ever been released into the wild, so it’s not like these facilities can augment wild populations. A true sanctuary or refuge should have a strict no breeding or handling policy, and should have education programs dedicated to promoting conservation.

Allison Skidmore , Author provided

Ultimately, tigers are big money makers, especially tiger cubs. The Animal Welfare Act allows cub petting from eight to 12 weeks of age. People pay $100 to $700 to pet, bottle-feed, swim with or take a photo with a cub.

None of these profits go toward the conservation of wild tigers, and this small window of opportunity for direct public contact means that exhibitors must continually breed tigers to maintain a constant supply of cubs.

The value of cubs declines significantly after 12 weeks. Where do all these surplus tigers go? Unfortunately, due to a lack of regulatory oversight, it’s hard to know.

Since many states don’t account for their live tigers, there’s also no oversight regarding the reporting and disposal of dead tigers. Wildlife criminologists fear that these tigers can easily end up in the black market where their parts can cumulatively be worth up to $70,000. There’s evidence of U.S. captive tigers tied to the domestic black market trade: In 2003, an owner of a tiger “rescue” facility was found to have 90 dead tigers in freezers on his property. And in 2001, an undercover investigation led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ended up leading to the prosecutions of 16 people for buying, selling and slaughtering 19 tigers.

5. What role does social media play?

Posing with tigers on social media platforms like Instagram and on dating apps has become a huge problem. Not only can it create a health and safety risk for both the human and tiger, but it also fosters a false narrative.

If you see thousands of photos of people with captive tigers, it masks the true problem of endangered tigers in the wild. Some might wonder whether tigers are really so endangered if they’re so easy to pose with.

The reality of the wild tiger’s plight has become masked behind the pomp and pageantry of social media. This marginalizes meaningful ideas about conservation and the true status of tigers as one of the most endangered big cats.

0,"Meghan Markle's first post-Megxit project is Disney Plus' new documentary ""Elephants.""

The documentary is a sweet tale about African elephant Shani and her son Jomo on an epic journey across the Kalahari Desert.

It will be too sweet for some, but families with young children should enjoy the homely tale that is full of cute moments and bereft of anything dark or graphic.

While the documentary doesn't break any new ground, Markle's enthusiastic narration gives a lot of life and heart to an already cute tale.

The run-time may be a little too long to hold the attention of some younger viewers, however.

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

The furore surrounding Meghan Markle and her first project post-Megxit has been so intense that the movie itself, Disney Plus' documentary entitled ""Elephant,"" is at risk of being forgotten about.

The attention has very much been on Markle's involvement rather than the documentary itself — and Disney Plus should probably be glad.

""Elephant,"" which follows African elephant Shani and her son Jomo on a journey across the Kalahari Desert with their herd, is largely forgettable. However, it is also a cute little tale that, while safe, should prove enjoyable enough for young kids and their families interested in this sort of subject.

Why you should care: It's Meghan Markle's first post-Megxit project

Meghan Markle is undoubtedly the biggest draw here. When Disney announced last week that Markle was narrating this documentary, the media went into a bit of a frenzy, with some tempted to call her a collaboration with Disney a glitzy grab at trying to get back to Hollywood.

However, as Insider's Royals Reporter Mikhaila Friel explained, this is actually a rather clever choice of first project for Markle, and is actually a tribute to her royal roots.

A role which didn't involve a step in front of the camera was probably wise for her first return to the screen, although her narration reminds us that she is an able actress. Regardless, her involvement is the USP of this documentary.

What's hot: Markle's narration brings a lot of life and heart to a very cute tale

""Elephant"" is clearly aimed at families with children on the younger spectrum, and everything is geared toward that audience.

The journey that the elephants go on is filled with various moments of danger (a baby stuck in mud, crocodiles, and the lack of water), but all of these moments don't feel very dangerous and they are all quickly resolved — probably so as not to worry the kids. This is Disney, after all, so parents need not worry about anything getting too graphic. It never does. Everything is treated with a child-like playfulness, which is not a criticism.

Indeed, parents and kids will be able to relax into this cosy film and be carried away on a light tale that doesn't get bogged down with information, or any graphic set pieces. Instead, it is content to float along to and keep you entertained.

Markle's narration, and the script itself, also seem geared toward young children. There are so many moments of cutesy comedy, with Markle churning out lines like ""Wait a minute... who is this guy?"" every five minutes or so. Markle's whole-hearted commitment to the story told in this documentary will be a delight to kids. She reads every line in the script with a huge amount of enthusiasm.

For kids interested in this sort of Disney Plus content, she is a perfect fit and brings a lot of warmth to a cute tale. She delivers the script like an endearing nanny reading a story to children, and young ones will easily be brought into the tale of ""Elephant"" thanks to her.

As expected from a nature documentary by Disney launched on the very slick Disney Plus, ""Elephant"" has a huge amount of visual panache, with the camera work expectantly excellent and plenty of stunning shots to amaze viewers of any age. It looks extremely well-made and is, indeed, very slick.

This is Meghan Markle's first project since leaving the Royal Family. Disney Plus

What's not: It will be sickly sweet to some, and feels too long for a documentary that doesn't break any new ground

It's a very, very sweet documentary. Sickly sweet, in fact. To a lot of older viewers, especially the more cynical amongst us, it will play as cloying, sugary, irritation. Meanwhile, Markle's narration, while good for kids, will quickly prove to be plain annoying for some.

The enthusiasm in her commentary is almost too much at times as it, too, borders on cloying. While not a comment on Markle's delivery itself (which she nails), it's just a style of narration that some will find grating and irritating.

It also feels far too long. Clocking in at a minute less than an hour and a half, it feels stretched out and a bit thin. It would benefit from a shorter running time with a more compressed story, and could likely have been done in less than an hour.

This running time makes even less sense considering that ""Elephant"" is clearly aimed at younger viewers, all of whose attention spans will not last an hour and a half on a documentary, particularly when there is every Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar film imaginable available on Disney Plus.

As a documentary, there isn't much information explored or told here that we haven't seen before. There have been plenty of documentaries and TV shows about elephants, and Disney's ""Elephant"" does not break any new ground — I doubt any older viewers will come away from it with any knowledge they did not possess before seeing it.

The bottom line: Slick, but far too candy-coated for adults

Slick and sweet are, ultimately, the two words I would use to describe this well-made documentary that, while it doesn't provide anything original or ground-breaking, would, with a slightly shorter running time, be perfect viewing for families with young kids to watch together with a mug of tea or hot chocolate on the sofa.

0,"Denver Zoo in Colorado is providing daily updates to patrons on the lives of its animals, as part of a national “closed but still caring” campaign prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.

Footage released by Denver Zoo on April 4 shows nine-year-old Amur tiger Yuri clawing, scratching, and biting a large cardboard box in the zoo’s Tiger Encounter exhibit.

0,"TUCSON, AZ — It's a girl! Just as families celebrate the arrival of a newborn, Tucson's Reid Park Zoo is offering the public the first pictures of a calf born Monday to its African elephant matriarch, Semba.

If you're looking for a virtual escape from the boredom of sheltering in place to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, you have the opportunity to lose yourself in photos and zoo webcam videos of elephants — the exceptionally smart and highly social giants of Africa's sub-Saharan savannas — and all the other animals at Reid Park Zoo. More on that later on in this story; but first, here are the deets of the birth:

The healthy calf was born at 3:33 a.m. Monday, bringing to an end 22 months of pregnancy — the longest of any mammal on the planet. The zoo said in a blog that the yet-to-be-named calf weighed 295 pounds and is ""healthy, standing and nursing.""

The new calf joins a brother, 9-year-old Sundzu, and a sister, Nandi, who will turn 6 this summer. Semba's pregnancy and labor both went smoothly and without complications, according to Dr. Sue Tygielski, Reid Park's director of zoological operations.

Elephant births — this is the second at Reid Park Zoo — are nothing if not unpredictable. The zoo animal care staff has been on around-the-clock ""baby watch"" for about seven weeks, the zoo said.

""Elephant births are exciting but also a test of patience for staff and the elephant mom,"" Tygielski said.

When the moment arrived, Semba handled it like a pro.

Zoo officials are celebrating not just the birth of the elephant calf but African elephants in general.

""As African elephants continue to face increasing challenges in the wild, each birth contributes to the global population and sustainability of this vulnerable species,"" Tygielski said in a blog post on the zoo's website. ""Today, the birth of this calf gives us cause for celebration at Reid Park Zoo, and it gives us optimism for the future.""

Only about 415,000 African elephants remain in the wild, and they are scattered across the savannas of sub-Saharan Africa. About 70 percent of their range exists on protected lands, yet the African Wildlife Foundation estimates 8 percent of African elephants are slaughtered every year for their large ivory tusks, which are converted into jewelry, crafts, musical instruments and religious objects. Due to poaching, African elephants could disappear entirely in our lifetimes, the organization dedicated to their protection warns.

The Reid Park Zoo's animal care staff is closely monitoring Semba and her calf to make sure everything is going smoothly. So far, it is.

""Semba is an excellent mom, and she has had close and nurturing interaction with the calf,"" Tygielski said.

Coronavirus Open/Closed In Tucson: Business owners, are you open or closed during the coronavirus outbreak? We've put together a directory of Tucson business hours and services offered during this difficult time. Make sure you're on it.

With the birth, the zoo now has six elephants. Semba's calf is the second born at the zoo; the birth of her second baby, Nandi in 2014, was the first born there.

The elephants are behaving as a typical family would when a new baby is born.

Scientific research, including observations and findings by field researchers, shows that as a species, pachyderms are a lot like people.

They are very social and frequently touch and caress each other by entwining their trunks. They're highly emotional and empathetic, grieving, mourning and feeling distress just as we do. The research also shows elephants express joy while playing games, when they greet family members and other elephant friends, or when a new calf is born.

Because the zoo tries to replicate the experiences of elephants in the wild as much as possible, the baby is getting to know the rest of the herd — just as parents would introduce their baby to siblings and other family members.

""Shortly after birth, Semba encouraged the calf to meet and touch Lungile and Nandi,"" the zoo said on the blog. ""Later in the day, Mabu and Sundzu had the opportunity to see the calf. Over the next few days, the herd will spend time together as a family.""

The zoo staff noticed breeding behavior between Semba and Mabu in the late spring of 2018 and soon confirmed Semba was pregnant.

Her prenatal care was not unlike what humans receive.

Semba received regular ultrasound examinations to monitor the calf's development and blood tests to monitor her hormone levels during pregnancy. Just as Tucson parents do when they're expecting a new baby, the zoo staff ""baby-proofed"" the habitat at the Click Family Elephant Care Center.

How To See Elephants During Coronavirus

Visitors can't see the elephants in person right now because the zoo is closed due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. But the zoo is sharing pictures of the baby elephant and all the other animals on its website. The zoo's Facebook page is also full of videos of animals that offer a pleasant distraction.

""This is a great day for Reid Park Zoo and, really, a beacon of hope,"" zoo President and CEO Nancy Kluge said in the blog. ""Coming during this challenging time in the world, this baby elephant is a symbol of the beauty and resilience of life for so many.

""We are just thrilled for Semba and the whole herd. We are grateful to our community for following Semba's pregnancy, especially while the zoo has been closed. We look forward to the day when we can welcome the public back to Reid Park Zoo to help us celebrate the joy of this new baby and our elephant herd.""

The first few weeks are a crucial bonding time between mom and calf.

""Semba and her new calf will be on a portion of the habitat soon, and we can't wait to share the calf via webcam and videos until visitors can come to the zoo again,"" Tygielski said.",Newborn Elephant At Tucson Zoo A Pleasant Coronavirus Distraction,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vcGF0Y2guY29tL2FyaXpvbmEvdHVjc29uL25ld2Jvcm4tZWxlcGhhbnQtdHVjc29uLXpvby1wbGVhc2FudC1jb3JvbmF2aXJ1cy1kaXN0cmFjdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://patch.com/img/cdn20/users/790386/20200407/013346/styles/patch_image/public/elephant-calf-1024x683___07132614536.jpg,2020-04-07,"{'sent': ""TUCSON, AZ — It's a girl!"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['TUCSON'], 'GPE': ['AZ']}}",Elephant
0,"A middle-aged couple of giant pandas in a Hong Kong theme park have mated for the first time in more than 10 years, after finally enjoying a period of privacy thanks to the coronavirus lockdown.

Ying Ying and Le Le have been at Ocean Park since 2007 but, despite the encouragement of zookeepers, they had shown little inclination to have sex while daily hordes of visitors were watching their every move.

Chinese scientists, after losing patience with natural breeding, extracted sperm from Le Le and artificially inseminated Ying Ying, but this resulted in miscarriages. When the pandemic forced the closure of the park on 26 January, the 14-year-olds were halfway through the panda’s average lifespan and almost a decade past the start of sexual maturity.

But, after more than two months of being alone together, the couple have recently shown signs they were in the mood for love. Local reports say Ying Ying – in her oestrogen cycle – spent more time in the water and Le Le left more scent markings around the enclosure.

On Monday morning, the pair were seen cuddling more intensely than usual and then finally did what comes naturally, much to the delight of park managers.

“The successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination,” Michael Boos, executive director for zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park, noted in a press release.

It is not yet clear if Li Li is pregnant but vets say hormone fluctuations and behavioural changes may give a clue by late June. “We hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year,” Boos said.

He said a panda cub would contribute to the conservation of a vulnerable species. Once the lockdown ends, such a popular draw could also rescue the tourist resort, which has recently reported financial difficulties.

The commercially-oriented park made no mention of the likelihood that the pandas were finally able to breed thanks to reduced stress from intrusive crowds. Instead it said the animals’ “success” was attributable to years of “trial and learning”, and the collaboration of experts from the Hong Kong park and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong.

Zoologists have long argued the panda’s reputation for a low sex drive was misleading because it was based solely on captive animals.

“The problems often attributed to them – short penises, narrow vaginas and low sex drives – are not an issue in the wild,” Jim Harkness, a panda expert and the former China representative for WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), said. “It is a phoney issue to say that pandas face a breeding crisis that we have to solve.”

He said the best way to protect the endangered species was to extend its habitat in the wild.",Hong Kong's pandas mate for first time in decade in privacy of coronavirus lockdown,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEAAqBh078GTkUE4w3NkxxxAqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDZ4PsF?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb817845a9aac8512a56f023dd5e57271b3052e/128_214_2532_1520/master/2532.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a1e7d54f5fcc7a1322150f9ff53e193c,2020-04-07,"{'sent': 'A middle-aged couple of giant pandas in a Hong Kong theme park have mated for the first time in more than 10 years, after finally enjoying a period of privacy thanks to the coronavirus lockdown.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong']}}",Giant White Panda
0,"Five minutes into the first episode of Netflix’s viral documentary series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem, and Madness, its codirector, Eric Goode, encounters a newly purchased snow leopard in the back of a van, suffering in the Florida heat. “That set me on this journey to really understand what is going on with people keeping big cats in this country,” Goode says in the series’ only narration. It’s a moment of feline sympathy that launches the show and sends Goode on a five-year quest to document Big Tiger—a cat-sprayed industry of breeders, traffickers, and wealthy narcissists exhibiting wild animals across the United States. The bigger the ego, the bigger the cat.

Goode, a somewhat well-known conservationist and entrepreneur, should be a natural fit for this series: he founded the Turtle Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit, in addition to creating and designing several nightclubs and hotels, including the Bowery Hotel in New York City. Unfortunately, Goode brings to Tiger King the intellectual rigor and social responsibility of... a nightclub and hotel developer. Don’t get me wrong, Tiger King is as fun as shootin’ up a stop sign. But the scene with the leopard in the van is the only indication in the five-hour series that anyone behind the camera gives half a litter box about wildlife. Instead, it selectively leaves out information to craft a narrative that entertains at the expense of both the cats and the actual earthbound truth.

I’m not a big-cat person. My familiarity with this world comes from the several months I spent last year producing and editing a podcast series called Cat People with reporter Rachel Nuwer. In the series, we explore and try to explain America’s tiger problem, including two episodes that cover much of the same ground as Tiger King. And while Cat People is a work of journalism that goes in a very different direction with the material than the quarantine-fueled supernova of mass entertainment that is Tiger King, the docuseries skims over or entirely leaves out the context viewers need to understand anything tiger related.

Tiger King looks at three organizations, each with its own charismatic figurehead. Joe “Exotic” Maldonado-Passage runs the GW Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, Bhagavan “Doc” Antle founded The Institute for Greatly Endangered and Rare Species (TIGER) in South Carolina, and Carole Baskin operates Big Cat Rescue in Florida. Tiger King would have you believe that all three facilities and their owners are versions of the same thing—egomaniacs who get off on owning wild animals and then selling that feeling of power and primal connection to the public. The show presents Joe Exotic as honest in his dishonesty, Doc Antle as a con man maintaining plausible deniability, and Carole Baskin as a hypocrite, having fooled her followers (and maybe herself) into believing that she’s somehow different than the other two. It glosses over the fact that her facility is, in most ways, fundamentally different.

You know why there are more tigers in captivity than in the wild? Because the general public will pay huge amounts of money to play with a tiny tiger cub for a few minutes. But tigers only stay tiny for a few weeks, so to maintain their supply, breeders like Joe Exotic and Doc Antle, as the series shows, churn out cubs for their petting operations and then unload them when the felines grow up, start chomping on customers, and develop a $10,000-a-year meat habit.

What Tiger King largely brushes aside is that Big Cat Rescue, on the other hand, only accepts animals confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who are trying to get rid of them. The series quickly skims over the fact that these cats are almost always adults and that the sanctuary forbids petting—if a staff member or volunteer touches an animal for any reason, they’re fired and never allowed to return. Finally, Big Cat Rescue will only take animals if the owners sign a contract declaring that they’ll never own, or even have a photo taken, with another big cat. If they violate the contract, there are financial penalties. The docuseries doesn’t mention this at all.

The Baskins aren’t just rescuing big cats, they’re also working on the problem at its source. The biggest threat to tigers’ survival around the world is habitat loss and poaching. When American diplomats try to push other countries to address their high levels of poaching, however, they’re basically laughed at and told to clean up their own problem first. The Baskins are trying to do exactly that. In 2003, they helped pass a bill making it illegal for owners and breeders to sell big cats as pets across state lines. Then, in 2016, they were part of a collection of environmental groups that convinced the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to close a loophole that allowed licensees like Joe Exotic and Doc Antle to sell big cats to each other. The Baskins’ latest lobbying effort is a bipartisan piece of legislation called the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which Tiger King briefly mentions before going back to more salacious material. It would ban all cub petting and exotic-animal encounters, including for hybrids like ligers and tiligers, effectively shutting down the mechanism that drives the tiger industry.

Instead of making this basic difference clear, the series paints Carole as greedy and manipulative, and it portrays her followers and contributors as having been suckered. Yes, she is uncomfortably cat obsessed. Yes, her organization’s music videos are pretty cringey. And it’s true that no one knows what happened to her second husband, Don Lewis, which Tiger King revels in for a whole episode. But it’s also true that all the fact-checked pieces of journalism about Carole Baskin (and quite a few have been published) end there—no one knows. Tiger King, on the other hand, gives a megaphone to the conjecture that Carole killed her husband and fed him to the tigers. The backlash to that conjecture? It defames her, of course, but it also limits her and her husband’s ability to do big-picture conservation work. It hurts the cats.

Let’s jump back to the breeders for a second, though, because that’s where Tiger King really drops the ball. The show gives voice to the idea that breeders are helping wildlife by increasing their numbers. “We’re makin’ more of ’em,” Joe says. This is one of the most common arguments you hear from tiger owners and breeders. It’s also intellectually dishonest, and the fact the series does not give anyone a chance to correct it in the documentary is irresponsible. Virtually all privately owned tigers in the U.S. are mutts who do not belong to any of the six distinct subspecies found in the wild and therefore are genetically useless to conservation efforts. The show lets Joe and others suggest that if it looks like a tiger, it must be a tiger, never bothering to point out that that’s not actually the case. Tony the Tiger would do better in the wild. At least he wouldn’t muddy wild genes.

These choices add up to a show that becomes propaganda for its own binge-worthy thesis: the whole industry is petty and shallow, to the point that none of these people who have devoted their lives to big cats actually care about animals. It’s good TV. It’s just not true.

Goode has stopped doing interviews about Tiger King, but he expressed some regret to Vanity Fair last month that the series wasn’t more focused on the animals. “Netflix is very adept at making binge-worthy television,” he said. Tiger King was supposed to be Blackfish for cats. Goode told his subjects he was making a film focused on environmental problems. He ended up with something that may actually be a step backward for tiger conservation in the United States.",'Tiger King' Is a Wild Ride.

WASHINGTON (CN) — Pointing to the strain on government resources during the coronavirus outbreak, a federal judge refused Thursday to expedite the issuance of permits that would allow hunters to import the body parts of African elephants shot for sport into the U.S.

Pro-trophy hunting and tourism groups are challenging the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s delay in acting on pending elephant trophy import permit applications as the Covid-19 pandemic stresses the agency’s resources.

The Dallas Safari Club, Namibian Ministry of the Environment and Tourism, Namibian Association of Community Based Natural Resource Management Support Organizations and a group of individual elephant sport hunters had urged the federal court in Washington to force the Fish and Wildlife Service to speed up the processing of the pending permits.

But U.S. District Judge Amit P. Mehta, appointed by Barack Obama in 2014, rejected the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction Thursday.

“Because plaintiffs have failed to show that defendant’s inaction has irreparably harmed the organizational plaintiffs, their members, or the individual hunter plaintiffs, the court denies the motion for a preliminary injunction,” Mehta wrote in an 18-page opinion.

The African elephant is listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act and is protected by strict hunting and international trade rules.

The Fish and Wildlife Service, however, allows a sport-hunted African elephant trophy to be imported into the United States if various conditions are met.

One of these conditions is that the agency has determined “that the killing of the trophy animal will enhance the survival of the species,” which allows hunters to be granted a so-called threatened species permit based on the idea that tourism revenue to African countries can help with conservation efforts. This, according to court records, is known as an “enhancement finding.”

The agency also sometimes made countrywide enhancement findings that applied to all sport-hunted elephant trophies in a particular country, but it announced in March 2018 that it would approve the importation of elephant trophies on a case-by-case basis.

The Fish and Wildlife Service has acknowledged that since it made the policy change, it has not issued any final determinations on pending trophy permit applications.

The groups and hunters suing the agency argue the delay has gone on long enough, but Mehta pointed to the current global crisis in denying their request for injunctive relief that would force the government to process all pending applications within 90 days.

“In light of the unprecedented disruptions created by the Covid-19 pandemic and the service’s likely diminished capacity to process permit applications during this period… this court finds it particularly unwise and not in the public interest to order the expeditious processing of sport trophy permit applications during this time,” the judge said.

Mehta also pointed to social-distancing guidelines that recommend limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people and working from home whenever possible, which also applies to federal government employees.

“The court cannot ignore the current Covid-19 pandemic and the particular hardship a mandatory injunction would impose in the present situation,” the ruling states.",Judge Won’t Fast-Track Permits for Importing Elephant Trophies,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9qdWRnZS13b250LWZhc3QtdHJhY2stcGVybWl0cy1mb3ItaW1wb3J0aW5nLWVsZXBoYW50LXRyb3BoaWVzL9IBXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9qdWRnZS13b250LWZhc3QtdHJhY2stcGVybWl0cy1mb3ItaW1wb3J0aW5nLWVsZXBoYW50LXRyb3BoaWVzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AP18247360634059-1024x618.jpg,2020-04-09,"{'sent': 'Elephants drink water in the Chobe National Park in Botswana in March 2013.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Botswana']}}",Elephant
0,"During these unusual times, many of us are turning to our television screens to binge-watch the latest shows — after all, we can all use a little escapism. One show, in particular, seems to have caught the nation’s fascination — “Tiger King.” Unfortunately, there is so much more to the story than what this sad reality show reveals.

After watching the first few episodes, it didn’t take long to understand why so many people were fascinated by the story of Joe Exotic, Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage, and others like him. For me, it was a display of blatant animal cruelty, substandard conditions, improper care and the often unpleasant personality traits of individuals involved in the exploitation of animals — and the exploitation of people.

On the surface, one might think hanging around exotic big cats is a dream come true. But for the animal victims in these lucrative businesses, their lives are far from a dream. The profits come from people paying top dollar to have their picture taken with a cub. But, cubs grow up — so to keep turning a profit, more cubs must be produced.

According to the Performing Animal Welfare Sanctuary in California:

• Cub petting operations must constantly breed their females. This “speed breeding” physically depletes the mothers, and cubs are often born sickly or dead.

• Cubs are ripped from their mothers shortly after birth, traumatizing both mother and cubs. The cubs are then hand-raised, depriving them of immune-boosting antibodies found in their mother’s milk and leaving them vulnerable to disease, including some that can be transmitted to adults and children who handle them.

• Once they grow big enough to be used for photos ops, cubs are subjected to hours of rough handling, denied sleep and often abused.

• After about eight to 12 weeks, the cubs can no longer be used, as they are more dangerous for the public to handle. They may be sold to other roadside zoos or private individuals, where conditions may be as bad or even worse, retained to breed more cubs, or, as “Tiger King” suggests, killed.

For many of us in the world of animal law enforcement, dealing with the captive wildlife trade and all the issues that go along with it can’t end soon enough. For decades, we’ve been trying to educate people, encourage enforcement in jurisdictions with little to no regulations on exotic animal ownership, and working hard to combat the breeding and resulting surplus of tigers in pseudo-sanctuaries, backyards and private breeders.

Reputable animal sanctuaries like PAWS and Big Cat Rescue only accept animals confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who are trying to get rid of them. The sanctuaries prohibit petting, and in the case of Big Cat Rescue, will only take animals if the owners sign a contract declaring that they’ll never own, or even have a photo taken with, another big cat.

It’s easy to breed tigers for profit, but it it’s harder to care for them in ways that help them thrive. Two national groups that ensure good care standards for exotic animals are the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries. If you come across a facility or individual promoting exotic animals, check to see if they are a member of either of these organizations before giving them your business or donations.

And, H.R. 1380, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, will provide a national framework to prevent many of the cruelties portrayed in “Tiger King.” Tigers, along with other exotic animals, belong in the wild and in properly accredited zoos and sanctuaries, not in the hands of individuals who exploit them.

While it’s unfortunate Netflix didn’t use this opportunity to expose the level of cruelty and inhumane treatment of these animals, I am heartened to see this is as starting point for conversations about how we treat wild animals and how we can work to end their exploitation.

0,"Joe Exotic, featured in the Netflix documentary series ""Tiger King,"" is the former owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park (also known as the G.W. Zoo) in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. He is serving a 22-year prison sentence for crimes including illegally transporting and selling tigers.

The over-the-top, oddball cast of characters in Netflix’s popular ""Tiger King"" series have one thing in common: They all claim to love tigers . They even insist that through the ownership and operation of zoos and petting events, they raise public awareness about tigers and so, in turn, are helping endangered species.

But those who work on the front lines of tiger conservation strongly disagree.

Experts told Live Science that the roadside and private zoos of ""Tiger King,"" all of which are unaccredited and unregulated, hold no value for tiger conservation. Rather, the zoos contribute nothing to the preservation of tiger populations in the wild; they breed captive animals that are prone to genetic defects and health issues; and they may even increase the threats to wild tigers from poachers.

""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness"" debuted on Netflix on March 20, delivering an almost unbelievable seven-episode story of tiger ownership and public display alongside drug addiction, gun fetishizing, polygamy, vendettas, suicide and assassination-for-hire. In fact, the human drama in ""Tiger King"" is so outlandish that it upstages the tigers.

Well, almost.

Tigers (Panthera tigris), of which there are nine subspecies, once roamed forests and grasslands across Asia, from Turkey to Russia's eastern coast, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Only a century ago, there were approximately 100,000 tigers in the wild. Today, just 2,000 to 3,000 tigers exist in the wild: in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia and Thailand, where they occupy less than 6% of their former range, the IUCN says.

But the idea that this rare cat can be helped by captive-breeding as many of them as possible is a misconception, said Dale Miquelle, coordinator of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Tiger Program and director of the WCS Russia Program.

""The problem is not that tigers can't breed in the wild. They are perfectly capable if they are provided with the minimum needs for survival — sufficient space, sufficient prey and protection from poaching,"" Miquelle told Live Science in an email.

Regulated breeding by reputable zoos can produce captive populations that may be suitable for reintroducing into the wild in areas where tigers have already vanished. However, as long as human activities continue to drive tigers to extinction in their native habitats, breeding more tigers won't help the species unless those ongoing threats are addressed, Miquelle said.

Regulated breeding

An estimated 5,000 tigers live in zoos or private collections in the U.S. alone. But just 6% of those tigers inhabit facilities that are accredited members of organizations such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Such zoos strictly monitor animal breeding, and have fundraising and public education programs that support tiger research and conservation, Leigh Henry, director of Wildlife Policy at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), told Live Science in an email.

About 230 zoological parks and aquariums are AZA-accredited; together, they care for more than 800,000 animals and support hundreds of projects worldwide to conserve vulnerable species and habitats, according to the organization's website .

AZA zoos participate in the Species Survival Plan (SSP), ""which strives to maintain captive populations that could be used for reintroduction should a species go extinct in the wild,"" said John Goodrich, chief scientist and director of the Tiger Program for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization. This guideline ensures that subspecies are separated, and that closely related tigers aren’t interbred — both criteria help to produce healthy, genetically diverse animals that could survive in the wild.

""This SSP strictly controls the captive breeding of species like tigers to ensure their genetic integrity and to ensure that the scale of breeding does not exceed that needed to meet the conservation goal,"" Goodrich told Live Science in an email. ""This stands in stark contrast to petting zoos like those featured in 'Tiger King.'"" (One zoo in the show is an exception: Big Cat Rescue, a nonprofit sanctuary in Tampa, Florida, which houses rescued animals and does not breed tigers or offer cubs for petting.)

Some of the ""Tiger King"" cats are not even true tigers, but rather ""human-created oddities"" — hybrids such as ""ligers,"" the offspring of lions and tigers, or white tigers, which are also bred through artificial selection, Miquelle said. And zoos that offer cub petting and photos require a steady supply of very young cubs, since they become too dangerous to handle once they reach a few months of age. Constant breeding with no oversight results in animals of uncertain lineage that can't be released in the wild, suffer from health issues and genetic defects, and so are of no value to tiger conservation, according to Miquelle.

An indirect threat

Roadside zoos and the thousands of tigers they keep may even indirectly increase poaching of wild tigers for body parts that are sold in illegal wildlife markets, said Henry. Because tiger ownership in the U.S. isn't strongly regulated, no central agency tracks who owns tigers, where they keep the cats, when tigers are traded or sold, ""or what happens to their valuable parts when they die,"" Henry explained.

This means that when captive tigers in the U.S. die, their body parts could be funneled into the international illegal trade pipeline, perpetuating the demand for tiger parts for traditional medicines and folk remedies. That, in turn, could encourage more poaching in countries where tigers live, endangering wild populations, Henry said.

With the runaway popularity of ""Tiger King,"" — it was seen by 34.3 million people in the U.S. in its first 10 days — tigers are basking in the public spotlight. But viewers who are newly intrigued by the endangered cats and want to help them should do so by supporting legitimate zoos and conservation organizations that are fighting to protect tigers in their natural habitats and to pass legislation that will end the illegal wildlife trade and regulate tiger ownership, Goodrich told Live Science.

""Given adequate protections, wild tiger numbers will continue to increase across their natural range — but conservation efforts need to be focused on recovering these wild populations,"" he said.",Outrageous 'Tiger King' zoo owners say they help tigers.

Editor’s note: Netflix’s new docuseries “Tiger King” takes viewers into the strange world of big cat collectors. Featuring eccentric characters with names like Joe Exotic and Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, the series touches on polygamy, addiction, and personality cults while exploring a mysterious disappearance and a murder-for-hire.

To Allison Skidmore, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies wildlife trafficking, the documentary didn’t bring enough attention to the scourge of captive big cats.

A former park ranger, Skidmore first started studying the issue in the U.S. after the infamous death of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe in 2015. She was shocked to learn about how little oversight there was stateside. We asked her about the legality, incentives, and ease of buying and selling tigers.

1. How many captive tigers are in the U.S.?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer. The vast majority of captive tigers are crossbred hybrids, so they aren’t identified as members of one of the six tiger subspecies – the Bengal tiger, Amur tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, and Malayan tiger. Instead, they’re classified as “generic.”

Less than 5 percent – or fewer than 350 – of tigers in captivity are managed through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a nonprofit organization that serves as an accrediting body in the U.S. They ensure accredited facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by law.

All the rest are privately owned tigers, meaning they don’t belong to one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ 236 sponsored institutions. These are considered generic and fall outside of federal oversight.

There’s no legal requirement to register these generic tigers, nor a comprehensive national database to track and monitor them. The best educated guess puts the number of tigers at around 10,000 in the U.S. Estimates put the global captive tiger population as high as 25,000.

In comparison, there are fewer than 4,000 tigers in the wild – down from 100,000 a century ago.

2. How do tigers change hands?

The Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna prevent the importation of tigers from the wild. So all tigers in the U.S. are born in captivity, with the rare exception of an orphaned wild cub that may end up in a zoo.

Only purebred tigers that are one of the six definitive subspecies are accounted for; these are the tigers you see in places like the Smithsonian National Zoo and generally belong to the Species Survival Plan, a captive breeding program designed to regulate the exchange of specific endangered species between member zoos in order to maintain genetic diversity.

All other tigers are found in zoos, sanctuaries, carnivals, wildlife parks, exhibits, and private homes that aren’t sanctioned by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They can change hands in any number of ways, from online marketplaces to exotic animal auctions. They can be bought for as little as $800 to $2,000 for a cub and $200 to $500 for an adult, which is less expensive than many purebred dog puppies.

3. Can I legally buy a tiger?

The U.S. is plagued with complicated and vague laws concerning tiger ownership.

However, there are no federal statutes or regulations that expressly forbid private ownership of tigers. State and local jurisdictions have been given this authority, and some do pass bans or require permits. 32 states have bans or partial bans, and 14 states allow ownership with a simple license or permit. Four states – Alabama, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Nevada – have no form of oversight or regulation at all.

An overarching, cohesive framework of regulations is missing, and even in states that ban private ownership, there are loopholes. For example, in all but three states, owners can apply for what’s called a “federal exhibitor license,” which is remarkably cheap and easy to obtain and circumvents any stricter state or local laws in place.

You now need a permit to transport tigers across state lines, but there’s still no permit required for intra-state travel.

4. What’s in it for the owners?

Some see it as a business venture, while others claim they care about conservation. I consider the latter reason insincere.

Many facilities promote themselves as wildlife refuges or sanctuaries. These places frame their breeding and exhibition practices as stewardship, as if they’re contributing to an endangered animal’s survival. The reality is that no captive tiger has ever been released into the wild, so it’s not like these facilities can augment wild populations. A true sanctuary or refuge should have a strict no breeding or handling policy and should have education programs dedicated to promoting conservation.

| Allison Skidmore



Ultimately, tigers are big money makers, especially tiger cubs. The Animal Welfare Act allows cub petting from eight to 12 weeks of age. People pay $100 to $700 to pet, bottle-feed, swim with, or take a photo with a cub.

None of these profits go toward the conservation of wild tigers, and this small window of opportunity for direct public contact means that exhibitors must continually breed tigers to maintain a constant supply of cubs.

The value of cubs declines significantly after 12 weeks. Where do all these surplus tigers go? Unfortunately, due to a lack of regulatory oversight, it’s hard to know.

Since many states don’t account for their live tigers, there’s also no oversight regarding the reporting and disposal of dead tigers. Wildlife criminologists fear that these tigers can easily end up in the black market where their parts can cumulatively be worth up to $70,000. There’s evidence of U.S. captive tigers tied to the domestic black market trade; in 2003, an owner of a tiger “rescue” facility was found to have 90 dead tigers in freezers on his property. And in 2001, an undercover investigation led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ended up leading to the prosecutions of 16 people for buying, selling, and slaughtering 19 tigers.

5. What role does social media play?

Posing with tigers on social media platforms like Instagram and on dating apps has become a huge problem. Not only can it create a health and safety risk for both the human and tiger, but it also fosters a false narrative.

If you see thousands of photos of people with captive tigers, it masks the true problem of endangered tigers in the wild. Some might wonder whether tigers are really so endangered if they’re so easy to pose with.

The reality of the wild tiger’s plight has become masked behind the pomp and pageantry of social media. This marginalizes meaningful ideas about conservation and the true status of tigers as one of the most endangered big cats.

Longleat Safari Park released candid photos of their lions, tigers and wolves showing visitors what they're missing during the lockdown.

Big cat keeper Caleb Hall used the time the park was closed to pictures of the Wiltshire park's famous lions as well as their two colonies of tigers and wolf pack.

The Amur tiger cubs Rusty and Yuki, who were born in July last year, were captured playfighting, resting and hanging out with their four-year-old mother Yana.

Longleat's pack of wolves is made up of alpha male Jango and alpha female Eliska and their six pups.

Caleb said: 'Despite all the dramatic changes taking place across the country, the animals here in the park are pretty much carrying on as if nothing has happened.

'We are all hoping it won't be too long before we welcome the public back but, until then, I plan to be regularly uploading new images online and sharing them on our various digital platforms.'

Longleat opened in April 1966 as the first drive through safari park outside of Africa and has been welcoming millions of visitors through its gates ever since.

The lions were the first animals to arrive. They have two prides of lions on the estate who live in separate enclosures.

The easiest of their lions to spot are called Harry, Claus and Simba.

It closed to the public from March 27 due to the coronavirus outbreak but they offer a 'virtual safari' which people can watch from home.

The last time the park had to close to the public was during foot and mouth restrictions in 2001.

Ellie Armstrong, science advisor for the nonprofit Tigers in America, told Insider that wildlife professionals in the US knew a documentary about the domestic tiger trade was in the works, but were horrified when they finally saw ""Tiger King.""

She said they had known tiger breeding and trafficking was a problem overseas, but didn't realize the extent to which it was happening in the US.

Director Eric Goode told Vanity Fair he had ""originally set out to do a slightly different story,"" admitting the personalities in the show ""did trump the issue of the ethicacy of keeping these animals in captivity, and especially the way these people were using these animals — exploiting them for profit.""

Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.

It's hard to avoid the buzz around Netflix's hit ""Tiger King"" docuseries at the moment, but two wildlife professionals say viewers are taking the wrong messages away from the show.

Officially titled ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,"" the Netflix documentary chronicles the escalating conflict between big cat breeders operating private zoos and animal rights activists, and the story ultimately spirals into an alleged murder-for-hire plot, as Insider's Margot Harris reported.

Insider's Jason Guerrasio added: ""But what makes this seven-episode docuseries something you can't turn away from is the flamboyant character called Joe Exotic. And that's saying really something because some of the other characters in the series include a conservation owner who is accused of running a cult, another who is a former cocaine drug lord, and a woman rescuer who is accused of murdering her first husband and feeding him to her exotic wild cats.""

Since the show was released, social media has been filled with Joe Exotic memes, tiger-related TikToks, and a conspiracy theory suggesting character Carole Baskin killed her husband, Don Lewis, then fed his body to the big cats in her sanctuary.

While the general public is understandably obsessed with a cast of characters weirder than any even Hollywood's finest could dream up, experts say Exotic's biggest victims, the tigers, get lost in all the crazy interpersonal drama.

Animals rights issues are a backdrop to the show's wild characters

Ellie Armstrong, science advisor for the nonprofit Tigers in America and a PhD candidate at Stanford University, told Insider that wildlife professionals in the US knew a documentary about the domestic tiger trade was in the works, but were horrified when they finally saw ""Tiger King.""

""The last I'd heard, it wasn't happening,"" she said. ""I guess things changed when Joe got arrested, and the producers decided to make a reality show instead of a documentary.""

She said they had known tiger breeding and trafficking was a problem overseas, but didn't realize the extent to which it was happening in the US.

Conservation biologist Imogene Cancellare, meanwhile, has spent years studying big cats, including working for an accredited wildlife sanctuary, Carolina Tiger Rescue, and researching the genetic connectivity of wild snow leopards across Central Asia.

Currently a PhD candidate in the Rare and Elusive Species Lab at the University of Delaware, she loathed the Netflix show, accusing the producers of relegating the tigers to ""background noise"" for most of the episodes.

Imogene Cancellare in the Valley of the Cats, China. Imogene Cancellare

""Conversations have been about the larger-than-life people rather than the plight of private exotic animal ownership and what it means for the animals,"" she told Insider. ""Producers played up the conspiracies with Baskin, but failed to distinguish her real — and much needed — efforts in combating animal abuse.""

For much of the series, Exotic is presented as a goofy anti-hero, despite being seen stealing a just-born tiger cub from its helpless mother who is still in labor.

The series also suggests he ""killed tigers, sold others in the middle of the night, and tried to hire someone to kill another person,"" as Cancellare puts it, but still: ""For too many people, the takeaway is 'Carole Baskin's a bitch.' It's wild misogyny.""

When directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin spoke to Vanity Fair about how the series came about, Goode, himself a conservationist, admitted the personalities in the show ""did trump the issue of the ethic-acy of keeping these animals in captivity, and especially the way these people were using these animals — exploiting them for profit.""

He added: ""Personally, I had originally set out to do a slightly different story.""

He later clarified his statement, saying: ""I went into this to explore a different side of the animal world in terms of wild animals in captivity. After spending years with these subjects the project moved in a different direction.

""Netflix is very adept at making binge-worthy television and with these larger-than-life subjects that was pretty easy to do. However, my goal is and has always been the same, which is to raise awareness and help save the species.""

What goes on behind the scenes at private zoos

When the baby tigers were brought out at Joe's zoo, hearts melted. But most of the visitors who pay for a similar experience, or witness it on TV, don't realize what likely went on behind the scenes, according to Armstrong.

""Tiger cubs separated from their mother aren't pleasant, snuggly little creatures,"" Armstrong said. ""They're screaming, biting, scratching, and difficult to handle.

""A big part of getting a cub ready for one of these pay-to-pet operations is making it submissive, and you can imagine what that entails. They're dangerous at a very young age, and their claws and teeth very sharp. Exhibitors will often declaw the cubs and even file down their teeth to make them safe for visitors.""

Ellie Armstrong in the field. Ellie Armstrong

Declawing may seem like a relatively harmless procedure, but there's a reason why most veterinarians refuse to declaw domestic house cats today — it actually involves amputating the last digits of their paws, Armstrong said, and many of the cats never fully recover.

Meanwhile, teeth filing at the roadside zoos has become so pervasive that there's a whole foundation, the Peter Emily Foundation, dedicated to repairing sanctuary cats' teeth.

Cancellare told Insider that instead of getting around-the-clock care from their mothers, these tiger cubs suffer from a host of maladies, including chronic exhaustion, stress diarrhea, and malnourishment.

Baby tigers have a relatively short window where they're small enough to be safely handled, so pay-to-pet operators like Exotic and Doc Antle, another zoo owner from the series, need to constantly replenish their supply of cubs by breeding. After the cubs outlive their usefulness, they're often either sold or killed, Armstrong said.

Not only do the tiger cubs suffer, but so do their mothers. After her cubs are ripped away from her, the mother immediately goes back into heat, Armstrong said. They become like breeding factories, producing three litters and up to 12 cubs each year, before eventually dying prematurely.

Tigers in roadside zoos and private collections often die of neglect or untreated curable illnesses, while others are killed outright because of the need for space, according to Armstrong. Some are even sold to taxidermists or into the parts trade.

For operations that have been breeding and selling for 20 years, Armstrong estimates the number of tigers killed ""could easily be in the thousands.""

Tilting the 'Tiger King' spotlight

Cancellare was reluctant to comment on the particular motivations of the ""Tiger King"" cast, but lamented that most private owners seem to view tigers as commodities instead of the regal animals they are.

""Because it's so easy to acquire a tiger, it's easy for people to collect and treat them as livestock for personal gain under the guise of conservation efforts,"" Cancellare said.

While the docuseries itself may not have delved too deeply into the abuse the tigers endure, it has sparked conversation amongst concerned wildlife professionals on social media and elsewhere.

Cancellare herself did a deep dive on the problems presented in the show on Twitter shortly after the series premiered.

""You can tell from the way people often pose with wild animals they're not realizing the implications of their actions,"" Armstrong told Insider.

""We believe discussions like this will help to raise awareness and at some point, people will stop patronizing roadside zoos and faux sanctuaries.""

What viewers can do to help

Instead of visiting unaccredited roadside zoos, Armstrong asks people to visit true sanctuaries, like PAWS in California, Indiana's Exotic Feline Rescue Center, or In-Sync Exotics in Texas, though a more thorough list can be found at tigersinamerica.org.

She also recommends donating to Tigers in America's Rescue Fund or another sanctuary and advocate for the Big Cat Public Safety Act (HR 1380).

Legitimate zoos and sanctuaries often support research efforts for wild tigers as well.

""Asking your accredited zoo or sanctuary what projects they support can be a good way to learn how you can support wild cats,"" Cancellare said. ""Non-profits like Panthera are collaborating with scientists worldwide to address the conservation threats to tigers in the wild. Support of their work, either through boosting them on social media or donating directly, ensures that conservationists can thoroughly address conservation concerns.""

Rumours are already circling around a potential follow-ups to ""Tiger King"" — including a movie starring Kate McKinnon as Baskin — but not surprisingly, both Cancellare and Armstrong have their reservations.

""I think the filmmakers have already shown us that they're not responsible storytellers,"" Armstrong said. ""We could use a real documentary, say a 'Blackfish' about big cats, and not a 'Swamp People' with tigers reality show.

""The fact that Joe killed at least five of his healthy tigers because he needed more cage space, but is still portrayed as someone who deserves our sympathy, did their viewers a serious disservice.""

0,"The most popular show on Netflix has made a cult hero of a man who abused and killed caged animals.

I am referring to “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” a documentary about a roadside zookeeper in Oklahoma named Joe Exotic, a.k.a Joe Maldonado-Passage a.k.a Joe Schreibvogel. He ran one of the largest tiger breeding and cub-petting operations in the country.

Joe Exotic is serving a 22-year sentence for wildlife crimes and a murder-for-hire plot to kill an animal rights activist. He is the Charles Manson of animal cruelty.

ADVERTISEMENT

Animals in cages are vulnerable and helpless. According to a lawyer for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, who testified at his trial, Joe Exotic shot five of his tigers in the head to free up space to board tigers for money and sold baby tigers to persons who he knew would crush their skulls with a hammer. He ripped months-old baby tiger cubs away from their mothers and declawed them, which is akin to cutting off a person’s fingers. It can cause lameness, psychological distress and even death to the animals.

Sure, Joe Exotic was exotic. He was a gay man in Oklahoma who had two-tone hair and a pistol and wore sequins; at one point, he had two husbands. Yes, we are all getting a little crazy in self-isolation, which is why the insanity of “Tiger King” may have been so appealing. And the people behind “Tiger King” appeared more interested in showing us Joe’s colorful life than what he did to his animals. The directors barely interviewed wildlife experts, who would have wiped away Joe’s appeal if allowed to describe his cruelty in detail in “Tiger King.”

All that still does not excuse rapper Cardi B’s tweet that, despite his proven crimes, she was going to start a GoFundMe for Joe. “He shall be free,” she wrote. (Now she says she was only fooling.) It doesn’t excuse actor Jared Leto posting a picture on Instagram of himself in a Joe Exotic costume; or Sylvester Stallone and his family dressing up as the cast of “Tiger King”; or an endless number of actors posing as Joe Exotic in publicly posted photos meant to land them a role in a movie version; or the fans who approached Joe’s staff members, even in a pandemic, to shake their hands and take pictures.

Many of Joe’s staff, according to an investigation by the Humane Society of the United States, abused, hit and mishandled animals. Yet the “bonus” episode of “Tiger King” was largely devoted to Joe’s business associates and employees. With smiles on their faces, they described how they have become celebrities and which actors should play them in a movie about Joe Exotic.

The Joe Exotic adulation will only encourage people to patronize private zoos like Joe’s. It certainly makes it easier for Joe Exotic to do his time because, according to “Tiger King’s” director, even in prison Joe’s fame has made him “happier than he has ever been.”

Joe Exotic and his accomplices deserve only revulsion and condemnation. A well-documented link exists between animal abuse, interpersonal violence and other serious crimes. As one study found, “indicators of animal abuse are remarkably similar to those of child abuse.” Forty-three percent of school shooters have abused animals. Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer impaled frogs, cats and dogs’ heads on sticks.

If any good is to come out of “Tiger King,” Congress must finally pass the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would go a long way to stopping the mistreatment of the thousands of privately owned big cats in the United States. Such a law would have prevented the owner of “Tony the Tiger” to keep a Bengal-Siberian tiger in a cage at a Louisiana road-side gas station named the Tiger Truck Stop.

When animal activists tried to stop the sickening spectacle, Joe Exotic rallied support for the tiger’s owner. Before it was finally euthanized because of health problems, the tiger had spent its life in that cage.

No one should be entertained by any of this.

0,"Meghan Markle's first major project since stepping back from her senior role in the royal family is finally here. The Duchess of Sussex lent her voice to the new Disney nature documentary Elephant, and this morning, she appeared in an exclusive clip on Good Morning America to promote the movie.

“I am really grateful to be able to bring this story of elephants to life,” Meghan said in the behind-the-scenes interview, which was filmed by Disney last year.

“I’ve been really lucky to be able to have hands-on experience with elephants in their natural habitat. When you spend time connecting to them in their wildlife you understand that we have a role to play in their preservation and their safety.”

The film, which is streaming now on Disney+, centers around a herd of elephants on an “epic journey” across the Kalahari Desert, and specifically follows an African elephant named Shani and her son Jomo.

“These creatures are so majestic and at the same time, they are so sensitive and so connected,” Meghan said on GMA. “You see in this film just how remarkable they are. Their memories are amazing, the close connection of the herd, the protectiveness of their young—I think they are a lot more like us than they are different.”

Back in January of this year, it was reported that Meghan had signed a voiceover deal with Disney to benefit the wildlife charity Elephants Without Borders, and this project is in partnership with the conservation organization.

“I hope that when people see this film they realize how connected we all are and if we had more of an awareness about the obstacles they are facing we would take care of each other, this planet and these animals in a very different way,” she said.

0,"A new scientific survey provides evidence of breeding tiger populations in eastern Thailand’s Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai forest complex, one of the last stands of the Indochinese population.

The outcome is the result of a decade-long program to protect tigers in this area.

Researchers deployed an unconventional survey design for this study, investigating the reliability of previous methods of estimating wildlife populations.

Camera traps in eastern Thailand’s Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai (DPKY) forest complex have yielded photos of tiger cubs, providing long-awaited evidence that the big cat is breeding in this part of Southeast Asia.

Conservationists conducted the camera-trap survey in the Thap Lan-Pang Sida Tiger Conservation Landscape (TCL) of DPKY, where recent reports suggest a small, but vital, population of tigers (Panthera tigris) occurs. (There’s currently debate about whether Indochinese tigers constitute their own subspecies, P. t. corbetti, or are simply a population of mainland Asian tigers, P. t. tigris, that also include the larger Bengal and Siberian tigers.)

“Efforts to improve anti-poaching patrols and law enforcement efforts are critical to providing a safe area for tigers to breed,” said Supagit Vinitpornsawan, the former head of the DPKY Wildlife Research Station. “Recent results of our monitoring indicate these efforts may be paying off.”

Published in the journal Biological Conservation, the new scientific survey shows a glimmer of hope for a decade-old program known as the DPKY Tiger Recovery Project. Conservationists say they may even be on track to meet a goal of increasing Thailand’s tiger numbers by 50% by 2026. It may be that Thailand’s tigers can avoid the fate of those in other countries.

Currently, conservationists believe only 221 Indochinese tigers remain in two Asian countries, Thailand and Myanmar, after a camera trap study in 2019 revealed the last remaining populations in Laos had vanished. Populations in Vietnam and Cambodia are also believed to be locally extinct.

But the DPKY population has room to grow. The estimated population for the study area is around 20 individuals, with a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 33 tigers. The researchers estimate the population density is only 0.63 tigers per 100 square kilometers (39 square miles) — a much lower density than other habitats in the tiger’s current range. For example, in Huai Kha Khaeng, in Thailand’s Western Forest Complex (WEFCOM), a previous study estimated a density ranging from 1.27 to 2.09 tigers per 100 km2 from 2005 to 2012. Still, differences in study design make exact comparisons difficult.

Categorized as endangered on the IUCN Red List, Thailand’s tigers are imperiled by poaching for tiger parts, poaching of their prey, and illegal rosewood logging. All these threats are present in the forest complex where they reside.

“If we fail to contain [the illegal wildlife trade] it is likely we will see the extinction of the species in the wild in the not too distant future,” said Chris Hallam, a conservation scientist in charge of monitoring and operations for Panthera USA. Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organization, collaborated on the survey with Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP), the Freeland Foundation, and Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU).

Tiger numbers in the wild have dropped from 100,000 a century ago to around 3,900 today, most of which survive in India. There are more captive tigers in the U.S. than there are wild ones worldwide.

For this study, the researchers used spatially explicitly capture-recapture (SECR) sampling, a popular method of population estimation. However, with so few tigers out there, reliable results were difficult, and, in the end, they found non-regular survey designs more beneficial.

“In our study, we utilized computer simulations to investigate and evaluate how different camera-trap placements and survey duration effect population estimates,” said Eric Ash, lead author of the study and a researcher with WildCRU.

The paper questions previous methods of estimating wildlife populations, a potentially valuable step toward improving our understanding of tiger distribution across their range.

To avoid extirpations similar to those in Laos and Cambodia, “monitoring is critical for managers to evaluate populations over time and determine the efficacy of conservation actions. It can also determine areas of conservation priority in which protection efforts can be focused,” Ash said.

But even remote monitoring with camera traps can lead to harrowing moments. Hallam says his biggest thrill during the camera trapping was “coming across a fresh urine spray from a tiger while putting out cameras.”

He added, “With such thick habitat and low densities, seeing tigers is difficult in the DPKY, but knowing I was mere seconds from one was both terrifying, exhilarating and humbling all at once.”

The zoo released footage on April 18 that shows its 400-pound male Amur tiger, Yuri, as he attempts to master a wooden ramp in his enclosure.

According to the zoo, Yuri’s female counterpart, Nikita, has no qualms about using the ramp. She was a “queen of the catwalk,” they said, compared to the more reluctant Yuri. However, “with our guests away, and with lots of encouragement,” the zoo said, Yuri finally conquered the ramp.

0,"Tiger expert Dr John Goodrich was researching Siberian tigers when he stumbled on an animal infected with the canine distemper virus (CDV) in Pokrovka, Russia, in 2003.

Like the tigers in Mersing and Dungun (see story here), the animal had – as recounted by Goodrich to National Geographic – “just walked into town and sat down”.

“I am aware of both cases in Malaysia and agree that it raises concerns for tiger health, ” says Dr Goodrich via email.

He was working with the Wildlife Conservation Society in 2003. Today, he is chief scientist and tiger programme director at conservation organisation Panthera and acknowledged as one of the world’s preeminent tiger biologists. He also serves in the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Cat Specialist Group.

Researchers estimated that at least 1% of the Siberian tiger population – numbering between 250 and 400 at the time – died of CDV between 2009 and 2013.

Dr Goodrich says no attempt was made to contain the disease at that time. “That is, it was allowed to run its course. There was no vaccination campaign for dogs, ” he says, replying to our question about whether Russian scientists embarked on a dog vaccination programme to help curb the disease.

While he believes that vaccinating dogs against infectious diseases is “always a good idea” because it promotes the health of domestic animals and can reduce the transmission of diseases among domestic and wild animals and humans, it is “not necessarily the best use of conservation funds for tigers as an emergency measure”.

“That is because while dogs may transmit canine distemper to tigers, there are many, many species of wild carnivores that are susceptible to and can act as reservoirs of canine distemper, ” he points out.

And in Russia, Dr Goodrich further elaborates, the CDV is likely endemic in a variety of wild carnivores, such as foxes and raccoon dogs, that serve as reservoirs for the disease. As tigers regularly interact with these smaller carnivores, often killing them for food, they can be exposed to the virus.

“Vaccinating domestic dogs may not have the intended impact on the prevalence of the disease in tigers because they get it from wild species anyway.

“Bottom line is that if research shows that domestic dogs and not wild carnivores are the key reservoir of the disease, then a vaccination campaign may help to protect tigers but it is likely that wild populations of other carnivore species are acting as reservoirs, ” says Dr Goodrich.

He says from his observation in the Siberian tigers case, it is imperative that animals are first diagnosed only based on the detection of the actual virus in them. This is because the presence of antibodies indicates only that an animal has been exposed sometime in the past and it might not be a current infection, he explains.

“Clinical diagnoses based on symptoms are often erroneous because there are other common neurologic diseases – for example, rabies, brain tumors, or even tapeworm cysts – that show very similar symptoms, ” he warns.

Like WWF-Malaysia’s Dr Mark Rayan Darmaraj, Dr Goodrich believes that having interconnected forest tracts is crucial to the survival of the Malayan tiger against the CDV.

The best defence to protecting tigers from the CDV and other infectious diseases is to maintain large, healthy populations through having vast expanses of forest, he stresses.

This is because while the CDV outbreak did result in significant loss of tigers from the study area in Russia, the population rebounded after that particular surge of infection was over.

“This was because it (the study area) was part of a large population of tigers covering some 100,000sq km of contiguous habitat.”

Dr Goodrich has previously worked in Malaysia and says the peninsula’s Central Forest Spine is still large enough to contain a similarly robust tiger population.

“Peninsular Malaysia is fortunate in that it still has vast tracts of intact forests large enough to contain a very robust tiger population.

“Maintaining this forest and protecting its tigers and their prey from poaching is the best way to secure the future of Malayan tigers.”",The best way to maintain a robust population of wild tigers,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiECVsHJHE5iAU3AtgCZzWsmAqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/21/651269.jpg,2020-04-21,"{'sent': 'Dr John Goodrich was researching Siberian tigers when he stumbled on an animal infected with the canine distemper virus (CDV) in Pokrovka, Russia, in 2003.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['John Goodrich'], 'ORG': ['CDV'], 'GPE': ['Russia', 'Pokrovka']}}",Tiger
0,"The Wild Animal Sanctuary near Keenesburg, Colo. — which relocated Fireball, Pearl, Enzo and 36 other cats two years ago to sprawling enclosures on its 789 acres — is experiencing a simultaneous drop in food and financial donations caused by panic buying and soaring unemployment.

“We had trucks come in with only 15 percent of what they would normally have,” said Pat Craig, who founded the sanctuary in 1980 and made it into one of the world’s largest nonprofit exotic animal refuges.

“We had to buy food to make sure we didn’t deplete our reserves,” he added. “We already spent quite a bit of money — $200,000, maybe more.”

The unplanned outlay replaced meat, fruit and vegetable donations from big box stores, which plummeted 80 percent in March. It coincided with the disappearance of income typically generated by tens of thousands of visitors each year. The sanctuary is closed because of stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the virus.

Some 550 critters — including lions, grizzlies, wolves and bald eagles — reside at the facility about 36 miles northeast of Denver and at a second 9,684-acre location in southern Colorado. Feeding them is no small task.

The animals consume as much as a small city — up to 80,000 pounds of food a week, including roasts, raw eggs, blueberries and cucumbers. The facility relies on $700,000 in donated groceries a month to feed its charges, Craig said.

Helping to fill the gap, Cisco recently dropped off a tractor-trailer load of fruits and vegetables, Craig said, adding that he is working with meat suppliers to procure chicken and beef. As supply chains correct somewhat, Craig said he anticipates that big-box food contributions will bounce back in April to 75 percent of normal. But that level is still untenable for the sanctuary’s tight budget.

“Being down 25 percent could still cost millions of dollars, depending on how long it lasts,” said Craig, who opened the sanctuary when he was 19, starting out with a few acres on his family’s farm.

Meanwhile, he continues to find space for animals, many of whom are former residents of the nation’s loosely regulated system of small and private zoos. The sanctuary took in a record 204 creatures in 2019, including 10 bears and three hyenas from a shuttered wildlife center in California, 13 bears from two Argentine zoos, and two lions, two Asian black bears and three tigers from a zoo in Virginia.

In November 2017, Craig worked with the PETA Foundation to relocate 19 tigers from the facility featured in “Tiger King” to his Colorado refuge. The cats had been shipped to Oklahoma — in a cattle truck in the middle of summer — by a Florida zoo in violation of a court order.

“Myself and several colleagues, and Pat and his team, arrived at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park with armed security based on threats of violence Joe [Maldonado-Passage] made against PETA and the Wild Animal Sanctuary in the past,” said Brittany Peet, PETA’s director of captive animal law enforcement.

Craig said he returned to Oklahoma the following month at Maldonado-Passage’s request to take an additional 20 cats and three black bears. The rest of the animals at the zoo — which housed as many as 200 tigers at a time, Maldonado-Passage has boasted — remained in the custody of its new owner. Maldonado-Passage is now serving a 22-year federal prison sentence for murder-for-hire and wildlife violations, including the killing of five tigers.

But the tigers’ plight is only touched on in “Tiger King,” which focuses mostly on the bizarre battle between Maldonado-Passage and his nemesis, animal rights activist and big cat sanctuary owner Carole Baskin.

“With its mullets, maulings and murder-for-hire intrigue, Tiger King and Joe Exotic have taken the streaming world by storm,” Nielsen Media Research said in a statement, estimating that more than 34 million U.S. viewers watched the series in the 10 days following its release. “The real-life documentary featuring big cats and even larger personalities seemed to give covid-confined consumers a way to escape from an even more real news cycle.”

Craig, other sanctuary owners and conservationists say they hope to steer the conversation away from the show’s histrionic humans to the tigers taken from their mothers when just hours or days old and offered to the public as playthings at private zoos and public events.

“Our sanctuary members who have big cats feel that the show did not go deep enough into the cruelty involved in the process of breeding, exhibiting, selling, trading and buying of big cats and the dismal lives they endure and what people can do about stopping it,” Vernon Weir, director of the American Sanctuary Association, which represents more than 40 members, including Craig’s refuge, wrote in an email.

Animal protection advocates support a bipartisan bill that would outlaw most private ownership of big cats and ban public contact with such animals, a practice they say that incentivizes the sort of intensive breeding Maldonado-Passage engaged in — and mass dumping when the animals get too large for petting.

Known as the Big Cat Public Safety Act, it has languished in Congress in previous sessions. But the directors of “Tiger King” say the series is generating momentum for the bill, which they support, and some lawmakers have echoed that.

The PETA Foundation said it scored a victory for big cats when a federal court ruled this year that prematurely separating tiger cubs from their mothers and forcing them to play with the public violates the Endangered Species Act.

Peet said her organization hopes to use that precedent to shut down the big cat-petting business. It’s an effort she hopes will give Craig’s ever-expanding Colorado refuge some breathing room.

“I’ve worked with the Wild Animal Sanctuary to rescue dozens of big cats and bears,” Peet said. “I could literally call Pat right now and if I told him I had animals in need of rescuing he would be on the road in an hour.”

0,"The number of captive tigers in Europe and the US is more than double the number left in the wild, according to a new report.

There are at least 1,600 captive tigers in Europe, compared to just 3,900 wild globally, says the global animal welfare organisation, FOUR PAWS.

FOUR PAWS state that tigers and cubs are being used as photo props and for selfies at facilities in countries including France, Germany, Spain and Malta.

""We know of one place where it is €50 for 10 minutes with a big cat cub,"" said Kieran Harkin, Head of Wildlife Animals in Trade at FOUR PAWS International.

It is estimated that many tigers eventually “lose their commercial value” and their body parts are sold for use in “traditional medicine” in Asian markets like China and Vietnam.

Previous data from 2018 had officially documented only 698 captive tigers in Europe, according to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

The new report comes just one month after a controversial Netflix true crime documentary ‘Tiger King’ exposed the breeding and trade of tigers in the United States.

FOUR PAWS told Euronews their concern that the demand for breeding cubs could result in a ""never-ending cycle"".

Horror stories of tigers being driven ""in the back of cars""

The private ownership of exotic pets, and the use of tigers in circuses is still legal in a number of EU countries, but FOUR PAWS says the trade is “poorly regulated and monitored” and many animals are suffering abuse in terrible conditions.

""Its quite easy for anyone to source and purchase a tiger in countries where private keeping is still legal,"" Kieran Harkin told Euronews.

""You only need to show enclosures and some authorities are not qualified enough to check if these enclosures are adequate enough for a tiger’s welfare"".

While owners usually have to apply for import and export permits, but Kieran Harkin says the European Union offers an exemption to this across borders.

""There are very few checks and we have heard all sorts of horror stories of people driving tigers and other big cat species in the back of cars"".

Most European countries also require prospective owners to have a licence for keeping a dangerous animal, but Harkin says the application and issuing of these licenses is ""also quite an easy process"".

FOUR PAWS also told Euronews that the sale of tigers for commercial gain can be a ""highly lucrative industry"".

A live tiger captive-bred in Europe can reportedly be worth up to €22,000, while a kilo of tiger bones could be valued at €1,700.

Which European countries have the most captive tigers?

CITES prohibits the commercial trade of wild tigers, and aims to ensure that any legal trade of tigers and parts has no impact on the survival of the species. But captive tigers are listed under a separate CITES Appendix, which does allow for their legal trade.

The Czech Republic and Germany have reported the highest figures of captive tigers in Europe, with 180 and 164 respectively.

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom, where the private keeping of captive tigers is legal, is third in the continent with 123 recorded animals.

Slovakia also reported 119 captive tigers, despite CITES recording just 3 in the EU country in 2018.

Just 17 of the 36 European countries contacted by FOUR PAWS, including only 12 EU member states, responded with figures.

NGOs estimate that Italy, one of those countries which did not respond, has 400 tigers kept in zoos, private homes and circuses.

FOUR PAWS says that many captive animals cannot be rehabilitated into the wild, while their illegal trade also fuels the demand for worldwide poaching of wild tigers.

""There will always be a higher onus on a wild tiger than a captive tiger, so by stimulating a greater demand for captive tigers, you’re actually placing more threat on wild populations,"" said Harkin.

""More efforts are needed,"" admits the EU as further measures considered

FOUR PAWS has urgently called on the European Union to ""suspend the export and re-export of live tigers and tiger parts"", except to legitimate sanctuaries.

The animal welfare organisation has further recommended that the EU introduces a comprehensive ban on commercial tiger trade to combat animal abuse.

""We need the EU to turn off the tap and stop this influx of tigers, and stop this breeding and distribution of tigers for different reasons, for circuses, for private keeping, and for petting across Europe,"" Harkin told Euronews.

""If we stop the commercial trade, and the only tigers that we see or are being bred across Europe have a legitimate conservation process, then that’s the ideal situation"".

""We do not need to be petting tigers, breeding hybrids and all this other entertainment"".

FOUR PAWS has previously launched projects focusing on the suffering of animals which are kept in inappropriate conditions, as well as in disaster and conflict zones.

The European Commission adopted an Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking in February 2016 to improve efforts against wildlife crime in the EU.

But despite encouraging signs, the Commission has said that “more efforts are needed” to combat the illegal trade of exotic animals.

“Wildlife trafficking continues to pose a serious threat to biodiversity, the rule of law and sustainable development, said Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, in 2018.

“We need to further intensify our efforts to reach the objectives of the Action Plan by 2020, and meet the target of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”.

""The European Union have been very good, working in other areas of the world when it comes to illegal wildlife trade,"" said Harkin, ""but it needs to look internally at its own jurisdictions"".

""We need a greater political appetite to do more and greater enforcement in Europe"".

Progress on the European Commission action plan is due to be assessed later this year. In a further statement to Euronews, a Commission source agreed that tigers need to be strictly protected.

""The Commission has therefore closely followed the recent cases of illegal trade in tigers in several EU Member States, and facilitated the exchange of relevant information among enforcement authorities through its expert group on wildlife trade enforcement.""

The EU say that, while there is no central register of tigers kept in the EU, authorities with member states have the responsibility and capability to control the keeping and breeding of tigers.

""The Commission has intensified its cooperation with the relevant enforcement authorities of the Member States and has asked them to pay special attention to these issues.""

""[We] will continue to monitor the situation, together with the CITES authorities of EU Member States and will consider whether further measures at EU level are needed.""

FOUR PAWS says they are also reaching out to members of the public to not take part in private interactions with big cats and recognise that ""these are not acceptable places in the modern world"".

‘If it is your dream wildlife or to interact with wildlife, do it in the wild - it does not compare with seeing a big cat in a sad state in a cage,"" Kieran Harkin told Euronews.

Masks are now required when caring for cats at the Greater Vancouver Zoo in Aldergrove, after a tiger in an American zoo tested positive for COVID-19.

“We have implemented increased precautionary measures such as all animal care staff are required to wear masks in specific situations particularly when in close proximity to felines,” animal care manager Menita Prasad said.

“As this is the first case of its kind, we are aware that certain animal species are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19,” she explained.

News broke in early April that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the corona-virus, after showing respiratory symptoms on March 27, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

The Aldergrove zoo has lions, a Siberian tiger, and cheetah that fit into the feline category.

Prasad said, prior to the instance, the zoo follows safety protocols to “minimize disease transmission” between animals and staff.

As COVID-19 cases have emerged in Langley, and the first animal transmission of the virus has struck the U.S., staff at the local zoo and the animals they care for continue to practise social distancing.

The 120-acre facility has been closed to the public, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 18.

COVID-19 and pet owners

The same U.S. Agriculture Department report that revealed a tiger at the Bronx Zoo was infected with COVID, encouraged everyday pet owners, if sick, to “wash their hands before and after the interaction.”

And if COVID-positive, people should restrict contact with their pets and animals, it said.

Conversely, “at this time, there is no evidence to suggest that any animals, including pets or livestock, can spread COVID-19 infection to people,” it added.

The ""critically endangered"" Gangetic Dolphins have indeed been spotted from the ghats of Kolkata!https://t.co/RYJjRET74q — News18.com (@news18dotcom) April 22, 2020

After nearly 30 years, 'critically endangered' South Asian River Dolphins (also known as Ganges Dolphins) are back across the ghats of Kolkata, all thanks to the reduced water pollution, due to the lockdown.

Well, this was possible only because the water quality in Hoogly river has improved significantly due to reduced pollution and industrial activity.

According to reports, in an interview with TOI , Biswajit Roy Chowdhury, a senior environmental activist stated he spotted a couple of dolphins at Babughat.

Even Wildlife photographer Ganesh Chowdhury couldn't believe that the dolphins had made a comeback after so many years. In an interview with TOI, he says:

I can remember even 30 years ago, these dolphins used to be spotted from different ghats of Kolkata. Then, as the water pollution levels increased, these mammals disappeared. Dolphins coming back simply indicates that the quality of Hoogly water has improved.

For those who don't know, the Gangetic Dolphins are the only freshwater dolphins in the world so, this is kind of a big deal.

As per News18 , 30 years ago, these rare Gangetic dolphins were regular visitors along the shores of Kolkata but, they were forced to leave their habitat (the Hoogly river) due to increased water pollution and human activity.

In a study conducted in 2017, by the Worldwide Fund for Nature-India, it was found that the population of Gangetic dolphins was barely 1,200 to 1,800. And, apart from pollution, one of the biggest threat to their existence in the Hoogly river was human activity and transport.

A 6-month-old giant panda met visitors to the Shanghai Wild Animal Park in the Pudong New Area on Saturday.

The giant panda, who is yet to be officially named, is known as ""Jia Jia boy"" to zookeepers as his mother is named Jia Jia. He was born on October 6 last year, and weighed 185 grams at birth.

He grew to 1,542 grams when he was one month, and now he is over 18 kilograms, leading to his other nickname ""little fatty.""

He was timid and slender when he was born but is now chubby with large eyes, animal keepers said.

He is also very active, naughty and bold, and likes climbing.

But he sometimes acts like a spoilt child, snatching food from his mother and distracting her while she is trying to feed.



The park operator has installed several screens showing a video clip of the boy's growth, and a real-time live broadcast at the giant panda area.

Visitors are reminded to keep quiet and not use flash photography when viewing the pandas.

A video clip of Ganges River Dolphin, an endangered freshwater dolphin breed, enjoying in the Ganga river in Meerut is going viral and taking internet by storm.

The video was shared by Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Akash Deep Badhawan on the microblogging site, Twitter.

It shows a pair of dolphins enjoying a swim in the Ganges. Badhawan, however, did not mention if the video was shot by him recently.

Alongside the video, he wrote, “DYK? Ganges River Dolphin, our National Aquatic Animal once lived in the Ganga-Brahmaputra-Meghna river system is now endangered. They live in fresh water and are practically blind, with small slits as eyes. Was fortunate to spot these in Ganges in Meerut.”

The IFS officer further wrote, “Officially discovered in 1801, these creatures are practically blind, with small slits for eyes. They hunt using ultrasonic sounds to track other fishes in the vicinity. Usually, solo, sometimes they are found in small groups, especially Mother and calf.”

He further added that, “Their habitat is largely tracts of Ganges where fish is aplenty and water currents are slow. Here, dense human population has led to fishermen catching them along with fish and they become a ‘bycatch’. However, they are still hunted at times for their meat and oil by few.”

Gangetic dolphins in Uttar Pradesh are mainly seen in Katarniaghat in the Terai belt of the state.

The population of Gangetic dolphins across the country is merely 600 of which their population at Katarniaghat wildlife sanctuary is around 100. Regular monitoring and awareness programmes have led to an increase in the dolphin population in the state of Uttar Pradesh. (IANS)

0,"The craziest Tiger Woods comeback you’ve probably forgotten about

Welcome back to the Tiger Woods YouTube Project, where we’re in the midst of a winning streak. Oh, and Tiger is, too. Today, Bay Area resident Josh Sens breaks down one of Woods’ most unlikely comeback victories on a Monday finish at Pebble Beach in 2000.

Yeah, we already borrowed one video from 2000, but that was a heck of a year — which means it’s worth reinforcing from a few different angles. Before we join the action, let’s contextualize where Tiger Woods was competitively at this point in time. He’d finished off 1999 with wins in seven of his final 10 PGA Tour events, including his last four: two WGCs, the Tour Championship and the National Car Rental Classic at Disney.

Then 2000 began at the Mercedes Championship in Maui, where Woods and Ernie Els entered Sunday tied and remained that way heading to No. 18, where each made eagle (I repeat: each made eagle!) to get into a playoff. Woods birdied the first playoff hole and poured in a 40-footer on the second to win. In summary, it didn’t seem like Woods could lose at this point.

Tiger Woods YouTube Project, Chapter 16: The ridiculous comeback

RELATED: Chapter 15 — “How Tiger and MJ became friends”

But it sure started to look like Woods would finally lose in his next start out. Midway through the final round at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he trailed by 7 shots. You already know what happened later that summer at Pebble, when Woods ran and hid from the rest of the field in a 15-shot romp. But you may well have forgotten the biggest late charge of his career. Let’s rewatch the film, shall we? And then we’ll hear from Northern California correspondent Josh Sens.

Here’s Josh Sens, proud Oakland resident, with 10 takeaways upon rewatching Woods alongside the rest of you. Enjoy!

1. For starters, Tiger was so much younger. Granted, we all were. But what makes Tiger’s youth so striking in these clips is the fact that he was playing like a man among boys. This was skinny Tiger, pre-bulked up Tiger, and he’s practically swimming in his Sunday red (except that it’s a Monday; more on that in a minute). He also almost sounds like pre-pubescent Tiger. Listen to his voice, caught on microphone here and there. It’s that youthful nasal twang that is still evident when he speaks today but now not nearly as pronounced. If you close your eyes and cup your ears to the 2000 Tiger, you think, Wait, THIS is the guy who rules the world?

2. I’d forgotten that this was a Monday finish. Another wet week at the AT&T. That’s how it always used to seem to be. Not long after came an extended drought here in Northern California, which made a lot of us who live here wonder if it would ever rain again. It rained again last year, at the 2019 AT&T, when Phil Mickelson won on Monday at Pebble. It was the first Monday finish in the event since 2000. But I digress. Point is, it was not your regularly scheduled programming . I don’t have the TV ratings handy, but I wonder how many fans who’d watched on Sunday wound up missing out on this historic close.

3. And dang, what a close. Woods was five back to start the day and seven behind as he made the turn. His run really starts on 12, where he stuffs his tee shot to a pin tucked left on that long par-3. Yes, the conditions were spongy, but watch how softly Tiger’s ball lands there, on a slender tongue of the putting surface. If you’ve played that hole, you know how ridiculously tough that shot is for most mortals. But that was Tiger. Making the implausible look routine.

4. And then, of course, there’s the hole-out for eagle on the par-4 15th. 97 yards, with a wedge. A thunderbolt, electrifying TV. Re-watching it, I got a kick out of hearing the call from then-CBS commentator Bobby Clampett, who grew up on the Monterey Peninsula and had once been seen as the can’t-miss kid. With Tiger’s ball in the air, Clampett says he likes the club selection, and then, his voice rising, that he likes the shot. As the ball drops, Clampett punctuates the moment with a nice minimalist ‘Oh!’—a restrained call, straight out of the Frank Chirkinian school.

5. Tiger has a lot of special gifts, but in those days, one of his greatest X-Men powers was his ability to make everyone fold around him, even if they weren’t in his immediate orbit. You get a glimpse of this in the YouTube clips. No sooner has Tiger holed out for eagle on 15 than we cut to leader Matt Gogel botching a drive, and Vijay Singh leaving one in the bunker. Tiger was paired with Jim Furyk that day. We get a flash of Furyk’s name on the back of his caddie’s jumper, but otherwise, he’s nowhere to be seen. In addition to making them fall apart, Tiger had a way of turning his playing partners invisible, too.

6. Tiger entered this event having won five in a row. Five in a row! Soon to be six. The record winning streak in PGA Tour history belongs to Byron Nelson, with 11. That was in 1945. Ben Hogan won six straight in 1948. But extended win streaks simply don’t happen in the modern game. Aside from Tiger’s. In 2006-07, it’s worth remembering, he reeled off seven in a row.

7. So, Tiger jars his approach for eagle on the par-15th, and then, on the next hole, also a par-4, he nearly repeats the feat. As his ball is in the air, Peter Kostis — another broadcaster no longer on the CBS team — says that the shot sounded heavy. Um. Guess not. A nano-second later, the ball nearly drops in the cup.

8. Pebble itself plays so differently depending on the time of year. Winter and summer are polar opposites. It’s not just the wet and soft conditions turning firm and dry. The prevailing wind flip-flops, coming from the south in winter and the north in the summer. That’s something that comes into clear relief in years when the course also hosts the U.S. Open. 2000 was just that sort of year. And we know who won that one as well, in record fashion, on a Pebble that was playing very differently. Anyway, I was reminded of the winter winds while watching Tiger play 18 in the AT&T. Driver, long iron to just in front of the green. In the summer, when the wind is up, you don’t usually see guys playing the 18th that way. Not even guys like Tiger.

9. Speaking of the 18th, Tiger’s drive on that hole hugged the coastline on the left. It was an aggressive line, very risky. If it were almost any other player at almost any other time, you’d have to figure that he pulled it. But this was peak-Tiger, at a moment in a tournament when it mattered most. So you got to figure he hit it exactly where he was aiming.

10. So Matt Gogel, then a rookie, was going for his first PGA Tour win, but he stumbled home in 40 and lost to Woods by two. Crushing, right? But to Gogel’s credit, he wins this very event two years later. Nice bounce-back. I mention Gogel here because in the YouTube clip, they show two views simultaneously as Gogel is putting out on 18, with Tiger looking on from a split screen. When his win becomes official, Tiger celebrates in a three-way hug with two other guys who were in his inner-circle but no more: Stevie Williams and Butch Harmon. Our colleague Michael Bamberger just published an excellent book called The Second Life of Tiger Woods. Given all that Woods has been through, that celebration at Pebble in 2000 seems like many lives ago.

The Netflix series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” exposed stunning allegations of animal abuse.

Exotic was convicted of nine violations of the Endangered Species Act after charges that included shooting and killing five healthy tigers in October 2017.

He was also found guilty in a murder-for-hire plot to kill a rival animal habitat owner and is currently serving a 22-year sentence.

But many are asking: Were others involved in Exotic’s criminal enterprises?

The one-hour special, produced by TMZ and available right now on Fox Nation, included reporting that the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Fish and Wildlife have launched investigations into the sale and transportation of endangered species, notably tigers.

Exotic’s former business partner and current owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, Jeff Lowe, as well as a South Carolina zoo owner Bhagavan “Doc” Antle are featured in the Netflix series and they spoke to TMZ.

Both vehemently any allegations of animal abuse, but others are not so sure.

“All I can say is that ‘Doc’ Antle is under investigation by multiple agencies,” said Brittany Peet, an attorney for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). “I have not heard that Jeff Lowe is under investigation, but he should be.”

In fact, Peet claimed that Exotic dished to her about his dealings with other zoo owners.

“He wanted to try to ally himself with us,” said Peet, “He even suggested that he might someday be a spokesperson for PETA speaking out against the cub petting industry and the roadside zoo industry. And he offered to share with me dirt that he had about others in the captive wildlife industry. And he did.”

In two extended interviews, also now available on Fox Nation, former prosecutor and Fox Nation host Nancy Grace spoke to a juror on Exotic’s trial and a former employee of the zoo, who told her that there are more animal abusers out there.

“I’m sure if they dig deep enough, they’re going to find a lot more players in this,” said Kelci “Saff” Saffery, a former animal handler at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. “I mean, the entire animal industry is connected.”

Saffery also detailed how Exotic would kill any animal — not only tigers — if he determined that he could profit off their deaths.

Kristen, the juror who sat on the panel that convicted Exotic, told Grace that she wished that former Lowe has taken the stand in the trial.

“I was honestly disappointed that Jeff Lowe didn’t take the stand. I did kind of want to hear how he was tied into it all,” she said.

0,"At the end of a dim hallway in Casablanca’s Université Hassan II, I’ve walked into a dusty room containing a remarkable set of fossils—bones that raise foundational questions about Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, one of the weirdest dinosaurs ever discovered.

Longer than an adult Tyrannosaurus rex, the 50-foot-long, seven-ton predator had a large sail on its back and an elongated snout that resembled the maw of a crocodile, bristling with conical teeth. For decades, reconstructions of its bulky body have ended in a long, narrowing tail like the ones on its many theropod cousins.

The red-brown remains laid before me are altering that picture. These bones assemble into a mostly complete tail, the first yet found for Spinosaurus. It’s so large, five tables are required to support its full length, and to my shock, the appendage resembles a giant bony paddle.

View Images Shovels scrape and pickaxes fly as crew members chip away at Morocco’s Zrigat site, where paleontologist Nizar Ibrahim and his colleagues have been excavating a Spinosaurus skeleton.

Described today in the journal Nature, this tail is the most extreme aquatic adaptation ever seen in a large dinosaur. Its discovery in Morocco stretches our understanding of how one of Earth’s most dominant groups of land animals lived and thrived.

Delicate struts nearly two feet long jut from many of the vertebrae that make up the tail, giving it the profile of an oar. By the end of the tail, the bony bumps that help adjacent vertebrae interlock practically disappear, letting the tail’s tip undulate back and forth in a way that would propel the animal through water. The adaptation probably helped it move through the vast river ecosystem it called home—or even dart after the huge fish it likely preyed upon.

“This was basically a dinosaur trying to build a fish tail,” says National Geographic Emerging Explorer Nizar Ibrahim, the lead researcher examining the fossil.

The structure of the bones—along with state-of-the-art robotic modeling of the tail’s movement—add fresh and compelling evidence to an argument that has raged for years among paleontologists: How much time did Spinosaurus actually spend swimming, and, by implication, how close did large predatory dinosaurs ever get toward a life in the water? In 2014, researchers led by Ibrahim argued that the predator was the first confirmed semiaquatic dinosaur, a hypothesis that generated pushback from peers who questioned whether the fossil Ibrahim’s team were studying was actually Spinosaurus, or even a single individual.

View Images Samir Zouhri, a paleontologist at Université Hassan II, Casablanca, explores a site near Sidi Ali, Morocco, for more fossils from the time of Spinosaurus.

By the time of Spinosaurus, 95 to 100 million years ago in the Cretaceous period, several groups of reptiles had evolved to live in marine environments, such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and the long-necked plesiosaurs. But those dino-era sea monsters sit on a different branch of the reptile family tree, while true dinosaurs like Spinosaurus have long been believed to be land dwellers.

Now, with evidence from the newly analyzed tail, there’s a strong case that Spinosaurus didn’t merely flirt with the shore but was capable of full-fledged aquatic movement. Collectively, the findings published today suggest the giant Spinosaurus spent plenty of time underwater, perhaps hunting prey like a massive crocodile. “This tail is unambiguous,” says team member Samir Zouhri, a paleontologist at the Université Hassan II. “This dinosaur was swimming.”

Other scientists who have evaluated the new study agree that the tail puts some lingering doubts to rest and strengthens the case of a semiaquatic Spinosaurus.

“This is certainly a bit of a surprise,” says University of Maryland paleontologist Tom Holtz, who wasn’t involved with the study. “Spinosaurus is even weirder than we thought it was.”



Bones and bombs

The story of Spinosaurus is nearly as unusual as the newfound tail, an adventure that winds from bombed-out German museums to the Martian-like sandstone of the Moroccan Sahara.

The remains of this odd animal first emerged from the depths of time more than a century ago, thanks to Bavarian paleontologist and aristocrat Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach. From 1910 to 1914, Stromer organized a series of expeditions to Egypt that yielded dozens of fossils, including pieces of what he would later name Spinosaurus aegyptiacus. In his first published description, Stromer struggled to explain the creature’s anatomy, speculating that its oddness “speaks for a certain specialization.” He envisioned the animal standing on its hind limbs like an off-balance T. rex, its long back bristling with spines. When the fossils went on display in Munich’s Paleontological Museum, they brought Stromer renown.

During World War II, Allied bombing prompted Stromer—a critic of the Nazi regime—to beg the museum director to move the fossils to safety. The Nazi director refused, and bombing destroyed the fossils in 1944. Drawings, photos, and descriptions in journal articles were all that remained to prove Stromer’s Spinosaurus fossils ever existed.

In the decades that followed, Spinosaurus took on a certain mythos, as generations of paleontologists found more of its close relatives across the world, from Brazil to Thailand, and tried to make sense of how they lived. Unearthed across four continents, these additional “spinosaurids” almost certainly ate fish based on their skull anatomy, tooth structures and, in one case, fish scales that were found preserved in a spinosaurid ribcage.

In the early 20th century, paleontologists were toying with notions of aquatic dinosaurs, including one idea that large plant-eating dinosaurs lived in lagoons to help support their immense weight. But decades of anatomical research now show that dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes, even the titans among them, thrived on terra firma. The anatomy of other spinosaurids’ hind limbs strongly suggested that they, too, walked on land.

Without a new Spinosaurus skeleton to examine, the species seemed destined to remain ambiguous.

Lost and found

Clarity would come decades later from southeastern Morocco, where thousands of artisanal miners have scoured the region’s rocks and found fossils that span hundreds of millions of years of Earth’s history. Hoping to find dinosaur remains in particular, some diggers have focused their energies on the Kem Kem beds, a sandstone formation between 95 and 100 million years old that starts 200 miles east of Marrakesh and extends 150 miles to the southwest. The rocks preserve traces of what was once a vast river system where fish the size of cars once swam. If you spot an exposed patch of the Kem Kem beds’ red sandstone on the side of a butte, you’re liable to find the mouth of a tunnel too short to stand up in, carved by local miners with a sharpened piece of rebar.

When miners come across fossils, they usually sell the bones to a web of wholesalers and exporters. This fossil mining industry provides vital income to thousands in this region, though it operates in a legal and ethical gray area. Locals dig year-round, making them almost certain to find more scientifically valuable specimens than academic paleontologists, who dig only a few weeks a year.

That’s why paleontologists get to know local diggers and frequently check their hauls. An assistant professor at the University of Detroit Mercy, Ibrahim, who is of German and Moroccan descent, travels from village to village whenever he visits Morocco, discussing locals’ latest finds in Darija, the local Arabic dialect, over steaming glasses of fresh mint tea.

On one such visit to a village outside the town of Erfoud in 2008, Ibrahim—by then a specialist in the Kem Kem beds—met a man who had found bones the scientist later realized might belong to a Spinosaurus. The encounter may as well have been fate. Ibrahim had loved Spinosaurus ever since he was a young boy growing up in Berlin.

Ibrahim’s research partners at the Natural History Museum of Milan alerted him to even more bones from the same local miner in Italy and helped secure their return to Morocco. A second trip by Ibrahim, Zouhri, and University of Portsmouth paleontologist David Martill in 2013 at last led the team to the Kem Kem outcrop where the fossils originated, and they started finding more bone fragments.

Ibrahim used these fresh fossils, previously found bones, and Stromer’s articles to attempt a fresh reconstruction of Spinosaurus. Their work, published in Science in 2014, declared the Moroccan fossils as a replacement for the original Egyptian ones lost in World War II bombings. Their reconstruction revealed the creature was 50 feet long when fully grown, longer than an adult T. rex.

The study also argued that Spinosaurus had a slender torso, stubby hind limbs, a skull shaped like a fish-eating crocodile’s, and thick-walled bones similar to those in penguins and manatees—features that pointed to some kind of semiaquatic lifestyle.

View Images Samir Zouhri examines a large Spinosaurus tooth at a villager’s home in Taouz, Morocco. Paleontologists in the region build relationships with locals to make sure that scientifically important fossils make their way to the public trust.

The study polarized paleontologists. Some reacted positively, convinced by the new data on Spinosaurus’s thick-walled bones. “That really sealed the deal for me,” says Lindsay Zanno, a North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences paleontologist who wasn’t part of Ibrahim’s research team. “Bone has memory,” she adds, noting that the microstructure of bone looks different in terrestrial animals, flying animals, or animals that spend most of their time in water.

For other paleontologists, however, the evidence presented in 2014 didn’t clinch the case for an actively swimming Spinosaurus. Those researchers thought it likely that Spinosaurus, like other spinosaurids, ate fish by wading into the shallows like grizzly bears and herons. But based on the incomplete Moroccan remains, could researchers now say for certain that the prehistoric predator did more than its kin and quickly swam after aquatic prey? If so, how did it move through the water?

Still others expressed doubt that the Moroccan bones belonged to a Spinosaurus. While the newfound Moroccan bones were clearly spinosaurid, the number of spinosaurid species in North Africa was, and is, a matter of scientific debate. Did the fossil’s anatomy exactly match Stromer’s lost Egyptian creature? Or did they instead belong to a close, but distinct, relative? “No one was particularly sure quite how many species or genera we’ve got [in North Africa], and quite where any one of them is in time and space,” says Dave Hone, a paleontologist at Queen Mary University of London and a spinosaurid specialist.

Seeking to put the controversy to rest, Ibrahim and his colleagues returned to the Moroccan site, with the support of the National Geographic Society, to check for more bones in September 2018. Time was of the essence: He had heard from local contacts that commercial fossil diggers were tunneling into nearby hills for bones. Ibrahim could not risk letting the rest of what he believed to be the world’s only known Spinosaurus skeleton vanish into collectors’ curio cabinets.

Fossil bonanza

The 2018 dig started brutally. To clear tons of sandstone, the crew bought the region’s only working jackhammer. It broke within minutes. Days were so grueling that several team members were hospitalized once they returned home. But the promise of discovery kept them going, along with Nutella breaks that temporarily took their minds off the punishing work. Finally, they started finding one caudal vertebra after another from the animal’s tail, sometimes just minutes and inches apart. The team was so giddy over the bonanza, they drummed out musical beats with their rock hammers and broke into song, belting out, “It’s another caudal!” to the tune of Europe’s “The Final Countdown.”

I got a taste for the site’s challenges, and the rush of discovery, when I joined the team in July 2019 for a return expedition. The 117-degree heat and arid winds wicked liters of water from my body as we chipped our way through an outcrop marbled like bacon. Fanned along the outcrop below, Ibrahim’s Detroit Mercy students lugged rocks in buckets made from recycled tires and scoured the debris for even the tiniest flecks of bone.

By the end of the next day, we’d found several Spinosaurus fossils, including foot bones and two dainty caudal vertebrae that would have formed the tip of the dinosaur’s tail. When the fruits of all this labor were at last laid out on tables back in the Casablanca lab, Ibrahim and his colleagues knew they had something truly remarkable.

By the end of 2018 alone, the dig team had uncovered more than 30 Spinosaurus tail vertebrae. Crucially, some of the tail bones neatly match up with illustrations of more fragmentary spinosaurid tail vertebrae that Stromer published in 1934, bolstering the case that a spinosaurid species living in Cretaceous North Africa ranged from Morocco to Egypt. In addition, Ibrahim and his team haven’t found any duplicate bones at the Moroccan site—a clear sign that the fossils belong to just one individual, an extremely unusual occurrence in the Kem Kem beds’ rough-and-tumble riverbeds.

Made for water

With the creature’s nearly complete tail now in hand, Ibrahim and his colleagues are more confident than ever that Spinosaurus was a swimmer—an assertion they’ve started putting to the test in the lab.

In February 2019, Ibrahim contacted Stephanie Pierce, curator of vertebrate paleontology at Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, with a question: Could she help him test how much thrust a dinosaur’s tail would generate in water? Though digitally modeling animal motion is one of her specialties, Pierce knew that answering the question required dynamic, real-world experiments. She and her colleague George Lauder, a fish biologist, agreed to join the team.

Nearly six months after the Harvard duo joined Ibrahim’s team, I walked into Lauder’s lab, a room whirring with ventilation and the fans of overworked computers. Lauder, sitting at a workbench, reached for an orange plastic sheet—the laser-cut outline of a Spinosaurus tail—and attached it to a metal rod. He then walked across the lab to what looked like an elaborately built fish tank and mounted the tail inside a tangle of metal beams hanging from the ceiling.

View Images With new bones come new models: Guzun Ion of DI.MA. Dino Makers, a museum sculpture firm in Fossalta di Piave, Italy, molds an updated version of the tail for a life-size Spinosaurus sculpture.

The device is a robot called the “Flapper,” which dangles beneath a water flume whose flow speed Lauder can control with exquisite precision. Studded with lights, cameras, and sensors, the ensemble can precisely track the aquatic movements of a swimming animal or a swimming robot—and the forces they impart as they move.

As I watched, Lauder lowered the Flapper into the water, and the plastic model Spinosaurus tail attached to it sprang to life with a motion meant to mimic a swimming alligator. With each flap, a shadow rushed across the tail—and data streamed into Lauder’s computers. The Flapper recorded the forces imparted by the tail, reflecting how well it would have propelled Spinosaurus through water.

Pierce and Lauder’s results, which are included in the Nature paper, show that the tail of Spinosaurus delivers more than eight times the forward thrust in water than the tails of the non-spinosaurid theropods Coelophysis and Allosaurus—and does so twice as efficiently. The finding suggests the giant Spinosaurus spent plenty of time submerged, possibly navigating rivers like a modern crocodile but on a massive scale.

That conclusion sets Spinosaurus apart from other water-loving dinosaurs described since 2014, including species that may have lived like geese or turtles. The more Lauder talks about a paddle on the rear of a predator up to 50 feet long, the more his eyes widen at the unprecedented nature of the discovery. “It’s unbelievable!” he says.

In future experiments, Pierce and Lauder say that a modified version of the Flapper trials could test a 3D model of the tail, or even a full-body model of the updated Spinosaurus, which would help clarify how the dinosaur’s six-foot-tall dorsal sail affected its swimming. To achieve that dream, though, Ibrahim wants to incorporate every last scrap of bone he can, which is why his team returned to the desert in the height of summer 2019 for more digging.

Some of the fossils I saw them find on that expedition will soon help test another aquatic feature of Spinosaurus: its possibly webbed feet. With more bones in hand, researchers can finally reconstruct the dinosaur’s whole foot to help test how widely Spinosaurus splayed its toes.

Crucially for Ibrahim, any fossils the team finds remain in Morocco, growing the collection that Zouhri, the Université Hassan II paleontologist, oversees in his Casablanca lab. The hope is that someday, these bones and the scientists studying them will seed Morocco’s first national museum of natural history—and inspire people across North Africa to dream of the lost worlds beneath their feet.

“What I want to do is build a home for Spinosaurus,” Ibrahim says. “This is going to become a symbol—an icon—of African paleontology.”",Bizarre Spinosaurus makes history as first known swimming dinosaur,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEHDE1TNXeAQMu9dJJwm7dW4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAowmrWECzDc_IADMJS5ngY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/science/2020/04/29/spinosaurus/spinosaurus-mm9074_191021_og2.ngsversion.1588180800002.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2020-04-29,"{'sent': 'At the end of a dim hallway in Casablanca', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Casablanca']}}",Indus River Dolphin

0,"As the coronavirus pandemic diverts attention and funds from wildlife protection to public health and global lockdowns deprive rural poor of desperately needed income, countries around the globe are witnessing an uptick in poaching of endangered species.

The Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC) on Wednesday reported stockpiling of ivory and other animal products as borders remain shut. In addition to the illicit trade of these products, the WJC cautioned that authorities risked leaving endangered species more vulnerable to poachers as they enforce lockdowns.

“A major concern is that poaching incidents may increase during the lockdown period, as criminal networks exploit perceived opportunities of park closures, reduced patrols in protected areas or the diversion of law enforcement resources to deal with COVID-19 issues,” it said.





Elephants, crocodiles, musk deer in Nepal

Poachers in Nepal are taking advantage of slack monitoring and sparse public movement during the COVID-19 lockdown, with the country seeing a surge in killing of wildlife under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.

On Monday, authorities said poachers killed at least six Himalayan musk deer near Mount Everest in the Sagarmatha National Park.

Tashi Lhamu Sherpa, deputy mayor of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, said the endangered animals were killed in a trap in a forest near Namche, a town on the way to Everest Base camp.

The poachers removed the glands, referred to as musk pods, from two male deer.

""Locals spotted the dead deer before the poachers could harvest the musk pods from the rest of deer that had fallen to the trap,"" Sherpa told the German Press Agency (DPA).

Musk pods, found in the male musk deer, are reportedly used to make perfumes, cosmetic products and Chinese herbal medicine. They are highly sought after commodities on the black market.

""Our studies show that most of the musk pods are smuggled to China,"" said Bhumiraj Upadhyaya, chief conservation officer of Sagarmatha National Park.

In the first 10 days of the lockdown that began on March 24, an elephant and three crocodiles were killed by poachers, officials said.

""We have increased patrolling following a rise in the movement of poachers, but it’s not surprising as we were expecting that something like this would happen,"" Bishnu Prasad Shrestha, a spokesperson for Nepal's Department of National Park and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC), told DPA on April 4.

DNPWC officials said that three critically endangered Gharial crocodiles were killed around Chitwan National Park, while the elephant was found electrocuted in the buffer zone of the Bardiya National Park in western Nepal.

Giant ibis in Cambodia

Some are turning to poaching as COVID-19 lockdowns deprive them of much-needed income. In Cambodia, the killing of three critically endangered giant ibis birds in early April was believed to have been driven by economic desperation amid the lockdown.

Three giant ibis were killed in a ""single deliberate poisoning event,” according to the country's Wildlife Conservation Society. The group said the bird killings were part of a growing poaching trend amid economic disruptions due to coronavirus.

The giant ibis is a protected species only found in Cambodia where the population is estimated to be less than 300. The three birds were illegally killed for their meat and were found on April 9 inside a wildlife sanctuary, WCS said in the statement.

WCS country director Ken Serey Rotha told the Phnom Penh Post newspaper on Tuesday that wildlife hunters had used the pesticide carbofuran to kill the birds, which could further poison other animals and people if the birds were eaten.

The bird meat would have been consumed locally or sold at the market, WCS said.

Colin Poole, WCS's Greater Mekong regional director, said conservationists' continued commitment to local people in rural areas was important now more than ever, since they have no social safety net, and are on the front lines of the defense of forests and wildlife in their areas.

""Suddenly, rural people have little to turn to but natural resources, and we're already seeing a spike in poaching,"" Poole said in the statement.

In addition to the giant ibis poisoning, more than 100 painted stork chicks were poached in a separate incident in March at the nation's Prek Toal Ramsar Site, which is the largest waterbird colony in South-East Asia, according to WCS.



Pangolin scales, ivory in Southeast Asia

The WJC said Wednesday that a ban on the sale of wild animals in China was causing backlogs in smuggling networks of pangolin scales and ivory across Southeast Asia. However, criminal gangs are adapting to tighter border controls amid the pandemic.

WJC operatives, often acting undercover, reported large stockpiles of ivory in Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos following a string of recent seizures.

In Vietnam alone, smugglers had access to more than 22 tons of pangolin scales, the WJC said.

""Brokers have made it clear that they intend on returning their operations to previous levels as soon as possible,"" Sarah Stoner, WJC's director of intelligence, told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

She said she expected high-value wildlife smuggling to rebound whenever COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.

The pangolin, an endangered species, is one of the most trafficked animals on earth, fueling a multi-billion-dollar trade for their scales, prized as medicine in many Asian countries.

Rhinos in South Africa

Travel restrictions are also pinching conservation efforts as wildlife sanctuaries can no longer lean on foreign volunteers to keep operations running. In South Africa, a rhino orphanage in Limpopo province was suddenly deprived of volunteers who regularly fly in from abroad to help keep the center running.

Manager and founder Arrie van Deventer, a 66-year-old retired teacher, made frantic pleas on social media for South Africans to help out.

""We were swamped,"" he said. He picked two volunteers from the several hundred offers. They are now staying put with the four permanent staff since last month's nationwide lockdown imposed by President Cyril Ramphosa.

The center has the tough job of looking after an orphaned baby rhino whose mother was killed by poachers when it was 7 days old. Mapimpi was dehydrated and withered. They found him trying to eat sand. Now he seems well-fed, relaxed and playful. At the age of 5, the rhinos in the orphanage are released back into the wild.

""We have dozens of rhinos that come through here, and 95% of them are because of the poaching pandemic,"" Deventer said. The precise number, like the sanctuary's location, are closely guarded secrets in order to protect them from poachers.

The game reserve adjacent to the orphanage has been attacked, unsuccessfully, twice.

Africa's rhino population has been decimated over the decades to feed demand for rhino horn, which, despite being made of the same stuff as hair and fingernails, is prized in East Asia as a supposed medicine and as jewelry.





Mandrills, African gray parrots in Cameroon

Financial pressures are being felt by wildlife reserves and conservancies across Africa, where money from tourism and foreign donations typically bankrolls efforts to protect the continent's most endangered animals from poachers and habitat loss.

The Limbe Wildlife Centre in western Cameroon, home to hundreds of gorillas, chimpanzees and other primates, has seen half its revenues evaporate in recent months with park visits canceled and cash-strapped donors in the U.S. and Europe freezing their contributions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Without a resumption of funding within the next three months, the center, a partnership between the Cameroonian government and an international foundation, could be forced to close its doors, said Guillaume Le Flohic, the park manager.

Besides vulnerable primates like mandrills, the Limbe center rescues dozens of African gray parrots, one of the world’s most trafficked animals, each year.

Le Flohic said he did not know what would happen to the animals if the park cannot come up with the more than $15,000 it needs for monthly operating expenses.

0,"Roads are proliferating worldwide at an unprecedented rate, with potentially severe impacts on wildlife. We calculated the extent and potential impacts of road networks across the 1,160,000-km 2 , 13-country range of the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris)—a conservation umbrella species. We found that roads were pervasive, totaling 134,000 km across tiger conservation landscapes (TCLs), even in tiger priority sites and protected areas. Approximately 43% of the area where tiger breeding occurs and 57% of the area in TCLs fell within the road-effect zone. Consequently, current road networks may be decreasing tiger and prey abundances by more than 20%. Nearly 24,000 km of new roads will be built in TCLs by 2050, stimulated through major investment projects such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Given that roads will be a pervasive challenge to tiger recovery in the future, we urge decision-makers to make sustainable road development a top priority.

We calculated three metrics—road density, distance to the nearest road, and relative mean species abundance (MSA)—to characterize how road networks influence tiger habitats. We also used published forecasts of global road expansion to calculate the length of new roads that might exist in tiger habitats for each tiger range country (where projections were available) by 2050. Combined, these metrics provide starting points for range-wide monitoring and impact assessments of road development projects, thereby enabling evaluation of progress toward country-level conservation and sustainable development goals. Our preliminary risk assessment for tigers can inform future research activities and road mitigation or placement strategies at policy-relevant scales, as well as act as a template for similar studies on other road-sensitive species.

Protecting tigers is a global conservation priority, exemplified by a landmark international initiative to double global tiger numbers (called “Tx2”) from 2010 to 2022 ( 22 ). The member organizations of this initiative selected 29 priority sites from 76 tiger conservation landscapes [TCLs; blocks of tiger habitat ( 23 )] across the tiger’s range that were considered crucial for reaching the Tx2 target. In addition to TCLs and the Tx2 priority sites, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) synthesized tiger occurrence records in 2014 to produce an updated tiger range map ( 19 ). Tx2 sites, TCLs, and the IUCN range map help delineate tiger habitats and are important for rallying support for tiger conservation; however, their designation does not come with specific road or land use restrictions. In contrast, protected areas that fall within the tiger range do restrict human development to varying degrees depending on protection status and social-ecological factors ( 24 ). Spatial assessments of road networks across these various classifications are lacking, which limits tiger conservation planning.

Here, we used a recently developed global roads dataset ( 1 ) to investigate the extent and potential influence of road networks across the 1,160,000-km 2 , 13-country range of the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris). Despite being a conservation flagship species, few studies assess the impacts of roads on tigers and their recovery [e.g., ( 17 , 18 )]. In the Russian Far East, for example, roads reduce tiger survival rates due to collisions with vehicles ( 17 ). In the Kerinci Seblat region of Sumatra, tigers avoided areas closer to public roads, suggesting that roads act as important barriers to movement ( 18 ). The emerging impacts of road development on tigers are critical for several reasons. First, much of the tiger’s remaining range occurs outside protected areas where policies on road development are less stringent ( 4 , 19 ). Second, tigers are found mostly in South and Southeast Asia, which will experience accelerating pressure from human development in the coming years ( 5 ). Third, road construction often catalyzes and exacerbates the three main threats to tigers—prey depletion, habitat degradation, and poaching ( 4 ). Fourth, tigers are concentrated in source populations across their geographic range, meaning that even a small amount of road construction could disproportionately affect tiger recovery by permanently isolating tiger populations from each other ( 20 , 21 ).

While roads are now ubiquitous across much of the earth, the construction of new roads will be concentrated in areas with high biodiversity value ( 2 , 5 ). In Asia alone, road length is expected to double between 2017 and 2020 ( 11 ). The Asian Development Bank estimated that about $1.5 trillion per year needs to be invested in new infrastructure projects in the Asia-Pacific region from 2016 to 2030 to meet growth projections ( 12 ). China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for example, is considered the largest infrastructure project of all time and will entail major risks to biodiversity across Asia, as well as Eurasia and parts of Africa ( 13 , 14 ). Many of these new roads and highways will likely traverse reserves or other highly biodiverse areas ( 14 ). Although roads are one of the most important impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, most “road ecology” studies have focused on localized patterns of wildlife mortality or behavior associated with road design as well as investigating the use and effectiveness of impact mitigation measures ( 15 ). While insightful, these fine-scale interactions are often site specific ( 16 ) and might fail to estimate the full extent of the impacts from roads on wildlife at broader scales. These broad scale effects are relevant to regional road development policies. Furthermore, we know little about how patterns in road construction will affect biodiversity in the coming decades.

Road networks are expanding worldwide at an unprecedented rate ( 1 – 3 ). Earth could accumulate another 3 to 4.7 million km of roads by 2050 ( 1 ). Although roads can facilitate economic development and improve human welfare, they can also have severe effects on wildlife populations by exacerbating habitat fragmentation and human disturbance ( 4 – 7 ). For example, roads affect wildlife by acting as barriers to movement and reducing gene flow, as well as through direct mortality caused by collisions with vehicles ( 8 ). Roads also increase access to remote areas, facilitating human settlement growth, natural resource extraction, and hunting and illegal harvest ( 9 ). Moreover, traffic disturbance from noise, lights, and motion reduces the quality of habitat near roads ( 10 ).

We estimated that nearly 24,000 km of new roads will be built in TCLs by year 2050, although this is an underestimate, because data from Myanmar does not exist. The estimated increase in road length and percent change in road length within TCLs varied greatly by country ( Fig. 4 ). The countries with the largest TCL area, and thus potentially the most important foci for the global tiger conservation community, have among the highest expected increases in kilometers of road length and percent change in road length (table S7). For example, India—which has more than 16% of the global TCL area—is expected to add by far the greatest amount of roads in TCLs (14,500 km), which is a 32% increase from current levels. Although Nepal and Bhutan have less total TCL area compared to several other countries, they are expected to add 43% (880 km) and 40% (609 km) more kilometers of roads, respectively, over the next three decades.

Map (top left) showing the four occurrence categories referenced in the 2014 IUCN tiger range estimates. Top right shows the proportion of each occurrence category with different levels of MSA. The MSA levels were the same as those in ( 56 ) to aid comparison. MSA ranges from 0 to 1, with lower values indicating a larger reduction in mammal abundance due to nearby roads. MSA levels <0.95 are considered influenced by roads, and levels <0.5 are considered heavily affected. We used MSA as a proxy estimate of road impacts on tigers and their prey. Bottom panels show MSA values (500 m by 500 m, color corresponds to MSA level in the top right panel) for four TCLs spanning the different IUCN occurrence categories. The four TCLs are designated Tx2 priority sites, and their location is indicated by the numbers in the top left panel.

On the basis of relative MSA values, we predicted that roads in tiger habitat have reduced mammal abundances by ~20% compared to what would be expected if roads did not occur in tiger habitat. This suggests that roads have decreased the abundances of tigers and the species that tigers rely on directly for prey. More than half (54%) of the tiger’s entire range mapped by IUCN in 2014 was influenced by roads, as reflected by an MSA < 0.95, and nearly 20% was heavily affected (MSA < 0.5). Moreover, roads influenced 43% of areas where tiger breeding had been detected (a crucial sign of population establishment) between 2009 and 2014. Some sites with known tiger breeding can have extensive road networks (e.g., Fig. 3 , bottom), with 14% of the total area of those sites having predicted mammal abundances less than half of those estimated in nondisturbed areas ( Fig. 3 , top right). Of additional concern is that the predicted average mammal abundance as influenced by roads was lowest in sites where tigers were detected between 2009 and 2014 (MSA = 0.76 ± 0.23) than in any another occurrence category, even compared to sites where tigers were considered to have been recently extirpated (MSA = 0.81 ± 0.22). Almost one-quarter of the area where tigers had been detected between 2009 and 2014 was heavily affected by roads (MSA < 0.5; Fig. 3 , top right).

More than half of the global supply of tiger habitat is within the road-effect zone (i.e., <5 km from nearest road), likely decreasing prey abundance and increasing levels of human-wildlife conflict and poaching. Distances from the nearest road ranged from 0 to 121 km in TCLs (Russia), with a median of 3.9 km (interquartile range = 8.1 km). However, more than half (57%) of the area in TCLs was less than 5 km from the nearest road—this is notable because this is a distance below which roads negatively affect the abundance of mammals ( 25 ). Despite having more roads overall, roads were more dispersed in Tx2 sites than in non-Tx2 sites. In Tx2 sites, the median distance to the nearest road was 4.1 km (interquartile range = 8.8 km), compared to 2.9 km (interquartile range = 6.3 km) in non-Tx2 sites (table S5). About 56 and 65% of the areas in Tx2 and non-Tx2 sites, respectively, were less than 5 km from the nearest road ( Fig. 2 ). Moreover, of all distance categories, the shortest distance category (0 to 500 m from the nearest road) was the most common for both Tx2 (14%) and non-Tx2 sites (19%; Fig. 2 ). Distances from the nearest road were generally longer in protected portions of the TCLs compared to nonprotected portions. In protected portions of TCLs, the nearest road was, on average, 9.5 km away from any given location, whereas this distance was 8.4 km in nonprotected portions. There was a substantial portion (44%) of the protected areas of TCLs that were less than 5 km from the nearest road ( Fig. 2 ), but this was much less than that of nonprotected portions (61%).

Road densities also varied widely within countries ( Fig. 1 ). For example, road densities in Indonesia ranged from the third highest of all TCLs (444 m/km 2 , Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape) to the second lowest (17 m/km 2 , Bukit Balai Rejang–Selatan; table S4 and fig. S1). Average road density within the 76 TCLs was 184 m/km 2 , ranging from a low of 13 m/km 2 in Xe Bang Nouan in Laos to a high of 628 m/km 2 in Rajaji Major in India. Of the 10 TCLs with the highest road densities, 2 are considered global priorities (Corbett-Sonanadi, Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape) and two are regional priorities for tigers (Panna East, Radhanagari). Road densities were also almost 25% greater in Tx2 (209 m/km 2 ) than non-Tx2 sites (168 m/km 2 ; table S4), suggesting that roads will be a pervasive challenge to tiger recovery in those priority areas.

Road densities varied widely across tiger range countries ( Fig. 1 and table S1). For example, China’s mean road density in TCLs (274 m/km 2 ) was nearly eight times greater than that in Malaysia (35 m/km 2 ). Road densities were, on average, 34% greater in nonprotected portions (154 m/km 2 ) of TCLs than the strictly protected areas inside TCLs (115 m/km 2 ), indicating that road density increased with the relaxation of protection status (tables S2 and S3). This was not the case in Cambodia, Malaysia, and Russia where road densities were actually higher in protected areas than outside them and in India where densities were about the same ( Fig. 1 ). Note also that Bangladesh, China, and Laos have no strict protected areas in their TCLs. Furthermore, the road densities in the protected areas of TCLs of some countries were higher than those in the nonprotected areas of TCLs in neighboring countries (tables S2 and S3). Mean road densities in the protected areas in Nepal’s TCLs (168 m/km 2 ), for example, were two times greater than the nonprotected portions of TCLs (84 m/km 2 ) in Bhutan. The difference was almost three times as great between Thailand (117 m/km 2 ) and Malaysia (40 m/km 2 ).

DISCUSSION

Our analysis demonstrates that tigers face a ubiquitous and mounting threat from road networks across much of their 13-country range. In terms of road density, TCLs varied considerably by protection status and country. In particular, road densities were higher in nonprotected areas of TCLs compared to protected areas, suggesting that protected areas are limiting growth of road networks in TCLs. These protected areas in TCLs are important, because they support tiger “source” populations that can disperse and repopulate larger landscapes (26). However, the relatively high road densities outside protected areas pose a considerable challenge to long-term tiger conservation. Regional road policies may be creating tiger “islands,” whereby tiger source populations are becoming increasingly isolated from each other. Tiger dispersal and population expansion into the nonprotected forests connecting those populations are necessary to ensure that the global tiger population has opportunities to grow (27). Even protected areas were not immune to road development, with those in the TCLs in India having the greatest density than any other tiger range country. Likewise, road encroachment into areas where tigers have been recently detected (2009–2014) is already pervasive and even greater than places where tiger presence is unknown or unlikely. Tiger habitats have declined by more than 40% since 2006 (19), underscoring the importance of maintaining roadless areas and resisting road expansion in places where tigers still exist before it is too late. Doing so can create opportunities for populations of tigers and their prey to make significant recoveries (28). Considered an umbrella species (29), protecting tigers from road impacts will also promote conservation of many other threatened species and some of the world’s greatest biodiversity hot spots.

Slowing road development in the tiger range is a pressing need. Our findings suggest that the 134,000 km of roads in the tiger’s current range may be decreasing abundances of tigers and their prey by more than 20%. Roads can affect tiger abundances via several mechanisms. In India, for example, increasing vehicular traffic is likely increasing direct mortality of tigers and their prey due to vehicle collisions (30, 31). Recent reports indicate that 10 tigers have died from vehicle collisions in India from 2015 to 2017 (32), although this number is likely an underestimate due to nondetection or nonreporting. Moreover, a simulation study in Central India found that tiger extinction risk rose steeply (through genetic isolation) when traffic volume increased on roads (33). Growth in road networks can also be associated with large-scale habitat degradation and thereby decrease the carrying capacity for tigers in landscapes altered by roads. For example, the Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape, which had one of the highest road densities in our analysis, lost nearly 40 km2 of forest from 2000 to 2012 largely due to expansion of palm oil plantations. Adult tigers in that landscape decreased from 36 to 22 over that same time period (34). Beyond land transformation, incursion of low-density, low traffic volume logging roads can increase human access to remote forests and exacerbate hunting and poaching pressure on tigers and their prey for years after road construction (35, 36). These “secondary effects” of roads on wildlife, therefore, extend far beyond the road corridor per se (37). Evidence of these secondary effects occurred in Russia where tiger prey species were negatively correlated with road density and tiger survivorship and reproduction were higher in roadless areas than areas with primary or secondary roads due largely to road-facilitated poaching (38, 39). In addition, construction of roads or railways in key wildlife corridors can fragment tiger habitats, especially in bottlenecks where tigers have very limited options for movement (40). Nepal, for example, is set to build 18,000 km of new roads by 2050 (1). Many of these roads are expected to cut through narrow forest tracts in the tiger-occupied lowlands, which could seriously jeopardize the gradual recovery of tigers in the country (27).

The rush to build major new roads throughout forested regions of South and Southeast Asia, financed through China’s BRI, could have severe impacts on tigers (41). As signatories on the Convention on Biological Diversity, all tiger range countries have legally binding responsibilities to create legislation that minimizes harm to threatened species including tigers (42). The BRI could be an important partner in that endeavor by adopting biodiversity conservation as one of its core values and learning from and supporting national-level conservation initiatives. That would set the stage for the BRI to plan and implement a network of protected areas and wildlife corridors that help meet, or exceed, the Convention on Biological Diversity’s targets for protection and safeguard tigers from the impacts of roads (13). The creation of bilateral agreements that include provisions for reducing wildlife poaching and trafficking between China and countries that are part of the BRI would also lessen the impacts of that infrastructure initiative on tigers and other species of conservation concern (8). Another policy to minimize road impacts on tigers and other wildlife would be to require Chinese-funded BRI efforts overseas to ascribe to the same strict environmental regulations on road development that now exist within Chinese borders (14). Likewise, national bodies and international funding agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, should mandate international oversight and standards on environmental impact assessments (14).

Our results highlight the need to make sustainable road development a top priority. Smart green infrastructure can promote tiger-friendly road projects by avoiding tiger habitats, minimizing and mitigating adverse impacts through design that accounts for consequences on tigers, and compensating for damages to tiger habitats to ensure net positive impacts (42). These strategies are part of the “mitigation hierarchy,” which provides a template for minimizing environmental harm through policy recommendations at national, sectoral, and project levels. For example, the first filter is to prohibit road development or other infrastructure from priority tiger populations or those areas identified as “no go” zones in national tiger action plans or other legislation. Upgrading existing roads, for example, paving a bulldozed track, should also be avoided in or near tiger priority areas, as those roads increase access to remote forests and might increase the likelihood of vehicle collisions with tigers and their prey (43). In places where roads are being planned, strategic environmental assessments can identify methods for reducing cumulative impacts, such as zoning around infrastructure to prevent settlement growth and clearance of forest cover. Crucially, environmental impact assessments should include secondary effects on tigers and meaningfully consult with stakeholders (including local communities where roads will be developed) before project approval (43). Biodiversity offsets financed through various mechanisms—e.g., tax and subsidy shifts, protected area transfer funding, and payments of ecosystem services—can also minimize adverse impacts of road projects on tiger habitats (5, 42). However, offsets should not be misused and compromise existing international agreements on the protection of biodiversity (44). Although most of the national-level tiger action plans mention the impacts of roads, mainstreaming smart green infrastructure design principles into the plans would provide concrete ways of understanding, monitoring, and mitigating the effects of road development on tigers. More details and recommendations on developing tiger-friendly transportation infrastructure are available in Quintero et al. (42) and in table S9.

Our metrics provide tools to support sustainable road development. For example, the estimates of road density can be used to classify regions according to their magnitude of road networks. These classifications can then be used to map areas unaffected by roads (i.e., roadless areas), which could be explored as “controls” for future studies. Distance from the nearest roads can be used to geographically define zones of influence within regions to target conservation action. Within the zones of influence, the cell-by-cell estimates of MSA highlights where road impacts on tigers and their prey are potentially (or could be) most pronounced. Combined, these metrics enable rapid risk assessment and can help identify no-go zones for road infrastructure. Identifying no-go zones will be especially useful for those countries where we projected high levels of future road encroachment into tiger habitats, such as in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Our spatial predictions of risk also allow screening of proposed road developments before decisions on road design, site, and construction preparation have already been made. This is important, as once those decisions have been made, impact assessments are too late to influence road planning (42). Our methodology can also provide baseline data to target locations for different conservation strategies, such as alternative road alignments to avoid key tiger habitats, road bundling, closure of vehicular traffic at night, decommissioning existing roads from tiger landscapes with source populations, road signage indicating the presence of tigers, and construction of wildlife crossing structures to maximize connectivity (45). Targeted road mitigation measures can, for example, support reintroduction efforts of tigers to places they have recently become functionally extinct, such as in Cambodia and Vietnam (46).

Our analysis is only a first step toward understanding and managing road encroachment into tiger habitats. Several avenues of research are needed to improve understanding. For example, how do roads alter tiger movements, hunting success, and mating? How do changes in those fitness-related behaviors translate to population-level effects? What are cost-effective methods for designing wildlife crossings that are most likely to encourage tiger movement over transportation infrastructure and maintain connectivity? Care is also needed to account for local contexts and variation in both space and time. For example, some areas might have relatively high tiger densities despite high road densities (e.g., Corbett National Park, India) because land clearing and road development occurred in the past and tiger numbers have since rebounded. In those cases, tigers may be capable of adapting to road impacts, although the conditions (e.g., low vehicle traffic) that enable tigers to cope with roads need to be better understood. In other cases, recent road development can drive declines in tigers and their prey, regardless of the current road density in the landscape (47). Furthermore, road development may create an extinction debt, in which there is a time lag between road construction and declines in tiger populations (48), necessitating long-term monitoring of tigers.

To our knowledge, fine-scale spatial data on abundances of tigers and their prey across gradients of road densities do not exist. Therefore, we used MSA as a proxy estimate of road impact on the abundances of tigers and their prey. The mammal datasets used in the meta-analysis were largely of European or North American species and biased toward carnivores and ungulates, comprising 16.3 and 58.1% of the data, respectively (25). We consider calculation of the MSA values to be a suitable first step in assessing road impacts on tigers across their range for the following three reasons. First, tiger abundances are tightly linked to ungulate prey abundances (49, 50). Second, tiger occupancy and habitat use have been shown to be negatively affected by roads (39, 51–53). Third, previous studies in Southeast Asia, although scarce, show negative relationships between roads and ungulate habitat use (54). Collecting more data on road effects on Asian wildlife species is needed to give us more accurate information for a region undergoing rapid change. In addition, our analysis treated all road types as having the same effect on abundances, which is largely appropriate, as most of the roads in the TCLs were considered “tertiary” roads (e.g., roads connecting villages or unpaved rural roads; table S8). However, larger roads, and especially unfenced highways, can act as population sinks for both tigers and their prey due to elevated human-caused mortality. Note that the global roads dataset we used, although the most complete to date, likely does not include every road within TCLs. Our findings, therefore, are conservative estimates of the true scope of the pervasive influence of roads on tigers and their prey.",Road development in Asia: Assessing the range-wide risks to tigers,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vYWR2YW5jZXMuc2NpZW5jZW1hZy5vcmcvY29udGVudC82LzE4L2VhYXo5NjE50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/18/eaaz9619/F1.large.jpg,2020-05-01,"{'sent': 'We calculated the extent and potential impacts of road networks across the 1,160,000-km 2 , 13-country range of the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris)—a conservation umbrella species.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Panthera']}}",Tiger
0,"Doc Antle, born Mahamayavi Bhagavan Antle, is the South Carolina-based founder and director of The Institute for Greatly Endangered and Rare Species (T.I.G.E.R.S.), a wildlife preserve for exotic animals located in Myrtle Beach.

The 60-year-old was born with the Hindu name and told the Miami Herald how he bonded with the hundreds of animals on his family’s ranch. In an article with the Macon Chronicle-Herald, he told reporters that he obtained a Ph.D. in zoology from the British College of Natural Science that he got after high school.

Antle told the Herald how he raised his first tiger cub in 1982, after borrowing it for a presentation. That cub would go on to be featured in an Exxon commercial, kicking off a career with big cats that has lasted for decades. Antle has been prominently featured on the new Netflix series, The Tiger King.

Here’s what you need to know:

1. He Runs a 50-Acre Wildlife Preserve

According to his Myrtle Beach Safari’s webpage, he founded T.I.G.E.R.S. in 1983 to promote “global conservation education through entertaining and interactive programs.” Those interested in visiting have the option to play with lion cubs, swim with an elephant and have other close encounters with exotic animals after for a fee.

There are nearly 200 animals on the preserve, which include a cheetah named Ramses; a 9,000-pound, 34-year-old African elephant named Bubbles; and 11-foot tall liger named Hercules. The site also features Siberian and Bengal tigers, chimpanzees, gibbons and African fish eagle.

He also founded the Rare Species Fund in 1983. His website states that he has several projects that the fund has supported in Uganda, Kenya, Indonesia, India, Brazil, Chile and other countries. The projects are described as being for the development and support of wildlife policies, research, education and conservation.

Countless celebrities have been photographed at the safari and/or with his animals, including football player Ndamugkong Suh, celebrity chef Bobby Flay and professional boxer Floyd Mayweather. His website states that despite the coronavirus pandemic, the safari is still open with limited availability for “small tours.” It had closed temporarily Apr. 1, but states that tours can be held as long as guests follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention safety guidelines. Tours start at $339 per person and options include “wild encounters,” “African Safari” and weddings.

2. He Was Featured on the Popular Netflix Documentary Series, ‘Tiger King‘

Doc Antle was featured in the show as one of the sources of inspiration and mentorship for Joe Exotic, the subject of the Netflix series Tiger King and the former operator of his own wildlife preserve. During the show, Antle was credited as one of the pioneers of providing interactive experiences with lions, tigers and other big cats. However, many questions were raised about Doc Antle’s private lifestyle and the way he operated his wildlife preserve.

One of his biggest critics featured in the film was a former trainer at his facility named Barbara Fisher, who said she worked there from 1999-2007.

So…Bhagavan has been saying I was never anything but a part-time babysitter. I’ve been saying I raised cubs and did photos all day every day for years…here’s a photo someone took with my wrist and tattoo in it. https://t.co/7DvMPhlL93 — Barbara Fisher (@BeeCrockfish) April 26, 2020

In an article she wrote for the Iowa Examiner, Fisher described a cult-like atmosphere where the female trainers competed for Antle’s attention, worked every day of the week from 8 a.m. to midnight and made the equivalent of $100 per week.

In an interview with Elle magazine, Fisher said, “I hope the takeaway from Tiger King is that this is an unregulated world where people can get away with anything they want to.”

In an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine, Antle disputed any claims of abuse, running a cult or underpaying the trainers. He admitted that he had multiple girlfriends who all knew each other, but denied having a “harem,” which was suggested in the series. Mirror reported that Antle sleeps with guns nearby due to the death threats he said he received after the show aired. In a Facebook post, he also said he was disappointed about how he was portrayed in the Netflix series.

During his operation of the preserve, South Carolina law enforcement served Antle with a warrant to take DNA swabs from his lions in Dec. of 2019, according to WMBF News, a local South Carolina TV station. Antle said it was animal rights, anti-zoo driven. TMZ reported that Antle is under federal investigation for his treatment of endangered species in their episode, “TMZ Investigates: Tiger King – What Really Went Down?”

There is also a petition circulating to “investigate Doc Antle for animal abuse.” People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has accused Antle of exploiting his animals and helping mainstream the tiger cub-petting industry, which the organization described as cruel and dangerous. Antle has denied these allegations.

3. His First Wife Died in a Tragic Car Accident

His wife, Dawn Marie Thurston, was originally from Crozet, Virginia . She attended Western Albemarle High School, according to a sophomore photo from the school’s yearbook

It’s unclear when or how they met, but Thurston and Antle were featured together in a 1989 article from the Macon Chronicle-Herald and referred to as Mrs. Bhagavan Antle. The couple was visiting Macon, Missouri to buy new animals at the Lolli Brothers Exotic Animal and Bird Sale to bring back to the old T.I.G.E.R.S. location in Buckingham, Virginia. In the article, she talked about helping to train many of his animals, such as a 48-day-old liter, Nikki.

“Nikki sucks on my finger to go to sleep,” she was quoted as saying. “She was up until 2 this morning.”

She was also involved with some of the animals that are still on the preserve; a 1995 photo of her riding Bubbles, the elephant, with Antle was printed in The Observer, a Virginia paper.



4. His Children, Kody and Tawny, Have Their Own Followings

On August 13, 1997, his wife, Dawn Marie Thurston, died at the age of 29 in an car accident, according to a death notice in The Observer, a paper out of Charlottesville, Virginia. She is the mother of Antle’s two children, Kody and Tawny Antle.

Kody Antle has built his own public profile as the “real-life Tarzan.”The 30-year-old often promotes the wildlife preserve on his very popular social media sites; 2 million people follow his Instagram page and 13.4 million follow him on TikTok In a video interview with In The Know , Kody described himself as being lucky to be born into the world of exotic animals. “I had tigers as my big sisters and brothers and I had an elephant as my big sister growing up. It’s just been a whole life filled with animals.”

His sister, Tawny Sky Antle, calls herself an Animal Mama, Tawny the Tiger and Queen of the Jungle on her Instagram page. She also has a social media following of 186,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel and nearly 100,000 on Instagram.



In an Instagram Q&A, she said that she has been to 17 countries, her favorite animals are great apes and she wears the baby tooth of the first tiger she raised on a necklace.

She also told fans, “Behind the scenes, I am not just an animal lover, but I’m an animal lover through and through. I am extremely passionate about wildlife conservation, am a vegetarian and get my hands dirty every day. This is my life, not a job.”

Even though they both grew up on a 50-acre preserve surrounded by wildlife, they also formed close bonds with other children as seen in these Instagram photos featuring Kody, Tawny and Sri Devi. In the photos, Sri Devi tags them for #siblingsday and uses the last name Antle on her Instagram page.



Sri Devi Antle desrcibes herself as an aerialist and dancer who often performs in themed shows. She also occasionally poses with baby tigers.

5. His Animals Have Been Featured in Several Shows, Movies and Films

Antle’s lion, Arthur, is the giant seen roaring between the MGM logo at the beginning of the company’s movies. Antle’s tiger was also featured in the “Tiger in Your Tank” Exxon ads of the 1990s, according to the Charlotte Observer. The article also mentioned movies featuring either Antle’s animals or his expertise as an animal handler, such as Dr. Doolittle, Jungle Book, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Wild America.

He was also Jack Hanna’s assistant at one point, and he can be seen bringing in a black panther out during The Tonight Show with David Letterman and working as the big cat’s handler. In 2001, he went on the Tonight Show and Jay Leno and he has appeared on television with his animals several times ever since, including on Howie Mandel’s show, Good Morning America and the Today Show.

Perhaps most famously, his tigers were used as part of Britney Spears’ Video Music Awards performance of “I’m a Slave 4 U.”

In a Rolling Stone video, Antle also discussed his animal’s performances in other music videos, such as Nas’ “Hate Me Now,” Janet Jackson’s “Together Again” and Ashanti’s “Rock Wit U.”

The cat lives in the regions of Altai, Tuva, Buryatiya and Zabaykalye - basically, areas full of steppes, making for perfect hiding spots.

Manuls aren’t crazy about snow, but they also have the thickest coat of all the cats in the world, allowing them to brave blizzards and snowstorms. Sadly, that is also the reason the manuls are hunted by poachers.

2. Snow Leopard

Public domain Public domain

The snow leopard - or ‘Irbis’, as they are known in Russia - is a spotted cat native to southern Siberia, in the Sayan Mountains. Nature has given it soft and furry “snow shoes”, and of course, its fabulous tail, about a meter in length - equal to his whole body - which the snow leopard has a funny habit of carrying in its mouth.

There are several reasons for this, chief among them that the cat’s tail muscles simply get tired throughout the day. An additional benefit is the ability to scratch its nose if its paws are busy! Very handy!

It is next to impossible to spot a snow leopard in the wild, as they are very few and far between, and try to avoid confrontations with humans, however the most intrepid - and patient - still can.

3. The Amur Tiger

Public domain Public domain

The largest of the big cats (an adult can weigh up to two tons) lives in Russia’s Far East, and is considered officially to be the most northern-living of all tigers. Needless to say, it’s not afraid of a little frost.

But the Amur tiger’s problems don’t end there. And it’s not just the poaching, but also the continued

deforestation of the Taiga, its natural habitat. There are only 350-400 of the beautiful cats left in the wild.

4. Atlantic Walrus

This sea giant inhabits the chilly waters of the Barents, Kara and White seas. The thing weighs about a ton and boasts a 15 cm layer of jiggly flubber, as well as half-meter-long tusks it uses to fight or lean itself on a slab of ice. Sadly, the tusks are worth a pretty penny on the black market, making the Atlantic walrus a frequent target of poaching.

5. Narwhal

Another native inhabitant of the Arctic is the narwhal. The animal is a whale species with a long tusk - a sort of marine unicorn, the only one of its kind. The narwhal’s list of problems doesn’t end with poaching - it also has to contend with the world’s waters becoming more polluted.

There were attempts to breed them in captivity, but the sensitive animal couldn’t adapt properly.

6. Dhole

Remember Rudyard Kipling’s ‘Red Dog’? Well, the Mowgli short story deals precisely with that animal, also known as the ‘dhole’. These canids often resemble red foxes from afar - they have a very similar beautiful fur coat. Meeting them in Russia is extremely rare, but possible in the Altai and Khabarovsk regions. Experts, however, believe that those particular ones are predominantly migrants from neighboring China and Mongolia.

7. Siberian Musk Deer

The Siberian musk deer - or saber-toothed deer - despite its fierce monicker, is actually an incredibly cute and harmless animal. Scary fangs aside, these gentle deers are exclusive herbivores, and never attack people. Sadly, this does nothing to deter people from hunting them - particularly for their musk-secreting glands. The strong-smelling substance is used for perfumes.

8. Fish Owl

One of the largest owls in the world lives in the Far East. The “fatty” weighs up to four kilograms, and has a wingspan of up to two meters. The fish owl, unlike the regular kind, is diurnal: it is most active during daytime, usually catching fish by swooping in and grabbing its prey with its talons.

9. Eurasian Beaver

This West Siberian member of the beaver family lives only in Russia. Before the 20th century, their numbers were high enough to avoid the endangered animals list, but poachers didn’t give these furballs a chance. Today, there are only a couple of hundred left in the wild, living near the Konda River, far away from human settlements.

10. Komandorsky Blue Fox

This little cutie only lives on Medny island, part of the Commander Islands (or Komandorskie Islands, as they are sometimes referred to) in the Barents Sea. In the 1970s, there was a sharp decrease in the number of cubs, many of whom were succumbing to ear scabies. The entire species had been under threat of extinction. Things aren’t much better today: there are only about 100 left in the world.

The sculpture was made by 85-year-old Juliet Simpson. According to reports, officers responded to the scene after residents spotted a giant tiger on the loose in the woods.

Ten armed police officers and a helicopter were deployed in Kent in the UK on Saturday after residents claimed to have spotted a giant tiger on the loose. However, all police discovered was a life-size sculpture of the wild cat made by 85-year-old sculptor Juliet Simpson.

According to a Guardian report, Simpson was alerted to the situation when her son Duncan called her to say that a search team was on the way to their house. Strangle enough, the sculpture had been made 20 years ago out of chicken wire and resin.

Speaking to The Guardian, Simpson said that the police officers were near the model for almost 20 minutes examining the model.

“They liked the model and said they thought it was very lifelike. They said they had to respond to people’s concerns,” she said.

Simpson’s granddaughter shared several pictures of police officials examining the life-sized sculpture.

“My Granny is a sculptor. Today 10 armed police and a helicopter were called to her house after walkers reported a tiger in the woods. This is the tiger,” she wrote on Twitter.

0,"It's been just over a month since the world began its obsession with Joe Exotic, Carole Baskin, and the wild Netflix documentary Tiger King. Now, one of the show's famous fans is helping give it the musical treatment.

With his brand new video ""Husband Number 2"" (premiering below), singer/actor Frankie Grande is joining the growing cast of Broadway composer Andrew Lippa's online parody series ""Tiger King: The Musical (A Parody!)"" In the video, Grande stars as Travis Maldonado, the late husband of documentary star Exotic (also played by Grande), as he begins his three-way marriage with the chaotic tiger breeder and his other partner, John Finlay (again, played by Grande).

While the video (directed by Ben Gettinger) begins with Grande's Maldonado being entranced by Exotic's fame, money, and access to guns and drugs, he quickly begins to spiral, realizing that he doesn't love the infamous zookeeper — especially since he was only one third of the relationship. ""Besides just tigers at the zoo, one man's above me/ And I don't think I'll be coming back for more,"" he belts.

The new video is the latest part of Lippa's ongoing parody musical, which kicked off with the Kristen Chenoweth-starring song ""Little Pieces,"" starring the Broadway icon as polarizing activist Carole Baskin, and followed by Phillipa Soo's ""Saff's Song,"" where the Hamilton actress portrays the one-armed G.W. Zoo staffer Saff Saffery.

Speaking to Billboard, Grande says that he knew he wanted to get involved in the project as soon as he heard Chenoweth's hilarious number. ""I immediately fell in love with the song and the project and decided to lip-sync [Chenoweth's] song for my Bathroom Talent Show series,"" he says. ""I reached out to Kristin, as she has been a long-time friend, and told her I would be performing this and she lost her mind with excitement! I shot the video, sent it to Kristin and then got a call from Andrew Lippa, who loved it! A day later he sent me the song 'Husband Number 2,' which he wrote for me.""

Frankie Grande is the latest star to drop a video for Broadway composer Andrew Lippa’s “Tiger King: The Musical (A Parody!)” — after Kristen Chenoweth crooned a tune as “Tiger King” animal activist Carole Baskin. And Page Six has learned that “RuPaul’s Drag Race” star Nina West is next.

In a new video for Lippa’s tune, “Husband Number 2,” Ariana Grande’s brother sings as Joe Exotic’s late lover, Travis Maldonado, and the song features lyrics such as: “They called you Joe/The boss, the man, the cat’s big cheese/How could we know/So soon you’d get down on your knees?” The video shows Grande-as-Maldonado becoming entranced with Exotic, before spiraling out of control.

Chenoweth sang a Lippa composition called, “Little Pieces” in a video — and sources exclusively tell us that the song’s about to be re-released with drag world superstar West as Baskin.

When asked if Lippa was working on a full-length musical based on “Tiger King,” his rep quipped: “If these stay-at-home orders keep going long enough, it might become an opera!”

0,"In recent weeks, the Netflix series “Tiger King” has been a source of amusement for countless Americans who cannot seem to get enough of Joe Exotic, Doc Antle and other big cat exhibitors featured. But as we have seen here in Houston and across the state of Texas, people who privately own big cats are dangerous to society. They sacrifice the welfare of the animals, they put the public at serious risk, and it is really not so amusing at all.

It is certainly not a subject for Texans to laugh about, for they live in the only state that leaves the regulation of dangerous wild animals, like tigers, to local governments. It is a proven disaster to do so.

Inconsistent Texas city and county ordinances are weak and frequently difficult to enforce, and they amount to a patchwork approach that has plainly failed to address public health and safety or animal welfare concerns. When private individuals keep tigers and other dangerous wild animals as pets in Texas, bad things happen.

For the lucky few, accredited sanctuaries like ours can step up and provide forever care for these wild animals. In 2019, for example, a tiger named Loki became the “poster-tiger” for this problem after he was seized from a barren cage in a garage in southeast Houston. Luckily for Loki, he is now healthy, safe and living on a large property at the Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch in Murchison. We also have another tiger, Alex, rescued from the exotic pet trade. Alex was seized by law enforcement in 2013. Living in his own waste in a tiny ramshackle cage secured by a flimsy latch, he was coated in mud and feces until he came to Black Beauty Ranch.

We have cared for several big cats over the years providing them permanent safety and sanctuary in naturally wooded, multi-acre habitats that allow them the ability to live as naturally a life as possible with as little interference from humans as possible. We give them an appropriate diet, access to dedicated care by trained professionals and a specialized veterinary program. Once they are here, they will never be mistreated or in danger anymore.

Another Texas tiger, Nahla, was found roaming the streets in Conroe after her owner’s property flooded during the 2016 Tax Day Flood. At that time, she was only 5 months old and weighed around 100 pounds. Thankfully, authorities recognized that a full-grown, 500-pound tiger did not belong in somebody’s back yard and awarded custody to an animal sanctuary, where Nahla is now living comfortably.

In both cases, the tigers were owned by people with no experience or knowledge of what it takes to maintain these animals in good health. At just a few months old, tigers become unmanageable and a threat to public safety. These situations are terrible for the animals too, obviously. Time and time again, private owners fail to provide the care and enrichment that these intelligent and sentient animals require to live healthy and normal lives. It is especially cruel to deny them their most basic biological and behavioral needs, day after day, month after month, and year after year.

If such animals cannot be in the wild, they must be placed with accredited sanctuaries and zoos, which are properly equipped to care for them and can provide the proper nutrients, enrichment and veterinary care. “Tiger King” made it pretty clear that Joe Exotic and his friends were without any credit or credibility as caregivers. They bred their animals repeatedly solely for photo ops and then brutally discarded the tiger cubs when they were too old to pose, at just a few months of age. That is not sanctuary or conservation. That is cruelty.

Is it really such a reach for Texas to prohibit private ownership of dangerous wild animals? Our state already has sensible laws to prohibit citizens from taking and keeping native wildlife as pets. And Texas Sens. Joan Huffman and Carol Alvarado have made the case for statewide legislation to bring an end to the nonsense, the risk, and the abuse that is inextricably linked to private ownership of exotic animals. It is really time that other legislators step up to lend their voices and their support to this commonsense measure that we clearly need in our state.

KATHMANDU: After the news on unilateral construction of a new link road by India to connect Mansarowar of Tibet, China, via Kalapani Lipulek area which falls in Nepali territory, the longstanding border dispute between Nepal and India has resurfaced.

Defence Minister of India Rajnath Singh mentioned on Twitter on Friday that the newly constructed link road easies pilgrims to reach Manosarowar, a famous Hindu pilgrimage site in Tibet, an autonomous region of China.

Minister for Foreign Affairs Pradeep Gyawali shared with Rastriya Samachar Samiti that the government received information regarding the issue via various media reports and detailed information regarding the same has been sought from the government of India via Indian Embassy.

He added that the Nepal government would make an official remark on the issue after receiving details from the Indian side, adding that the government has always been alert about Lipulek and Kalapani issues. Earlier, the border dispute surfaced after India unilaterally unveiled its political map incorporating the Nepali territory on it.

That's right! For a modest entry fee, you too can see and cuddle some of Joe Exotic's famous big cats. He's definitely around in spirit, even though the park is now run by Jeff and Lauren Lowe, the new owners.

TMZ reported huge crowds at the grand re-opening, and social distancing was out the proverbial window. The controversial practice of cub petting is still an option, and it seems like the popularity of the recent Netflix documentary, Tiger King, has drummed up increased business for the infamous exotic animal park.

General admission is just $15 per person and $10 for children under 12. If you have $80 to spare, you can get a two-person appointment for six minutes of playtime in the nursery with the baby animals. For the full VIP tour, you'll have to shell out $195 per person, but it includes a full tour of the zoo, with impromptu feeding opportunities with all different types of animals.

If you can't quite swing the trip to Oklahoma, you can always show your big cat love with some official Tiger King merchandise. Tiger-striped T-shirt? Don't mind if I do!

The state government deputed a fact-finding team to probe into the death of a tiger at Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) even though the autopsy report confirmed the death due to traumatic injuries.

Headed by principal chief conservator of forest (Project Tiger) PK Sharma forest and comprising senior IFS officer Ramesh Pandey and Kanpur zoo vet R K Singh as members, the team visited the site of the incident in Pilibhit on Wednesday and expected to submit its report within a week.

“We will decide the line of action after the team submits its findings,” said principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Sunil Pandey. The five-year-old adult male tiger which had injured three villagers on Friday died 15 minutes after it was tranquillized at Jari village on Sunday evening.

While forest officials claimed that the big cat died of earlier wounds, some wildlife activists suspected the death due to overdose of tranquillizers.

The autopsy report by the centre for wildlife conservation, management and disease surveillance at Indian veterinary research institute (IVRI) has confirmed that the tiger’s death was caused by traumatic injuries in his thoracic cavity which caused excessive internal bleeding.

The autopsy report also confirmed subcutaneous contusions and haemorrhage on the dorsum of his neck, shoulder and thoracic wall, which had superficial presence of maggots. In addition to many other internal injuries, the chambers of its heart had blood clots. The tiger’s toxicological report is awaited.

“The injuries described in the autopsy clearly indicate that the tiger had been brutally beaten by humans and that the maggot wounds were at least 7-10 days old,” said B M Arora, president of Indian zoos and wildlife veterinarians.

0,"BRIDGEPORT — While the state tentatively plans to start to reopen places including the state’s only zoo in the coming weeks, staff at the Beardsley Zoo are prepared should an animal at the facility be infected with COVID-19.

Gov. Ned Lamont announced in late April that some establishments, ranging from zoos with outdoor exhibits to restaurants with outdoor seating, can reopen on May 20 — so long as Connecticut doesn’t see a surge in cases or hospitalizations.

For the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport, staff have been prepared to reopen since the facility closed to visitors because of the new coronavirus back in March, according to zoo Director Gregg Dancho.

“We have to do it the right way when we reopen,” he said during a recent interview. “It’s still very tentative.”

But while planning for a reopening is difficult enough, Dancho said, the facility’s staff also has to continue to care for its animals, knowing that some cats at another facility have tested positive for the virus after showing symptoms.

Dancho said the Bridgeport zoo — which has many big cats including two Amur tigers and two Amur leopards — immediately had staffers working with the big cats don additional protective gear when news spread that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York had tested positive for COVID-19.

The Bronx Zoo confirmed on April 5 that 4-year-old Nadia, a Malayan tiger, had been infected with the new coronavirus. She was the first animal to show symptoms, the zoo said in a statement.

Samples were collected from Nadia’s nose, throat and respiratory tract while under anesthesia, the Bronx Zoo said. Those samples were tested and she was confirmed to be infected with the virus.

Nadia’s sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions at the New York City zoo also developed a dry cough, the zoo said. Fecal samples were collected from the six big cats; they all tested positive.

The zoo said the animals saw “some decrease in appetite” and a cough — although one tiger never developed a cough but did test positive for the virus.

So far, no animals at the Bridgeport zoo have exhibited COVID-19 symptoms.

To help care for all the zoo’s animals, Beardsley has a full-time veterinarian technician who has worked with the zoo for years, doing rounds twice a week. Dancho said one of the most important aspects of zoo operations behind the scenes is preventative medicine.

“Testing is always a big thing for us,” he said.

Dancho said staffers collect fecal samples to check for illnesses like worms, and blood samples to test for things like anemia. He said testing is also done for rabies and tuberculosis.

“Every animal at the zoo has some kind of examination at least once a year,” Dancho said.

Sometimes those exams can be visual to check for behavioral or diet changes, while others are more physical and require tranquilization or anesthesia at the zoo’s on-site animal care center — which serves as a fully-equipped veterinarian hospital with X-ray machines, holding rooms, a treatment room and an operating room.

Being a long-time accredited member of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums and caring for various threatened species, Beardsley Zoo staffers are always on high alert for any changes in the facility’s animals.

“We’re watching these animals all the time,” Dancho said. “When something is off, the staff knows immediately.”

If one of the big cats at the zoo started to develop symptoms linked to the new coronavirus, Dancho said, staffers would keep a closer eye on the animal for a few days to see if the behavior or symptoms continues. If so, then staffers would prepare for testing.

“We would have to tranquilize the animal, especially with tigers,” Dancho said.

But since the tigers are conditioned through training to walk into a crate to be brought to the zoo’s animal care center, he said, they wouldn’t necessarily have to be tranquilized in their habitat, which can cause stress.

“Tranquilization of an animal is something we try to avoid the most,” he said.

Once the animal is in the care center and under sedation, Dancho said, “it’s just like your dog going to the veterinarian.”

He said if an animal showed signs of the new coronavirus, the zoo would run a full workup as a precaution, including blood tests and a dental exam.

“You want to make sure you’re covering all the bases, especially when you’re working with such critically endangered species,” Dancho said.

For now, he said, the zoo will continue to take additional precautions until the pandemic passes.

“Our staff is gowned up, masks on, gloves on,” Dancho said. “They are monitoring the health and welfare of the animals every day.”",How do you test a tiger for coronavirus?

A person of few phrases, Kapoor doggedly units digicam traps to seize the motion of the beast, breaking protocols and risking his security. He is solely centered on one tiger, a lot to the bewilderment of an accompanying intern (Manjot Singh), who’s equally amused and interested by Kapoor’s obsession with the tiger. Sahirr Sethhi’s brief movie Zoya takes the viewers together with Kapoor into the recesses of Kanha Tiger Reserve, bringing to fore a bigger metaphorical query of non-public fulfilment and the lack of nature, typically in a a lot too apparent trend, however raises pertinent questions nonetheless.

A well-intentioned idea, Sethhi’s movie finds its origins within the director’s admiration for tigers and his need to discover the mindset of a wildlife conservationist. He vividly remembers the primary time he noticed a tiger within the forest as a 15-year-old and the sheer awe of recognizing the beast. The 27-minute movie falls wanting bringing out that astonishment. The try to make a bigger level in regards to the interdependence of nature and man’s longing to repair his failures stays on the floor, and the movie is unable to convey out the complexities concerned within the course of. The dots are too apparent to be linked and seem parabolic. The movie is shot with care and ease however there’s additionally a scarcity of an imaginative eye. Although what makes the movie engrossing, is the timing of its launch. A yr after Greta Thunberg’s international local weather disaster marketing campaign, the COVID-19 pandemic has reinstated the dominance of nature and its adamantine bond with mankind. “Today, we take a step back and watch nature heal itself and Zoya emphasises the importance of preserving nature and wildlife,” says 32-year-old Sethhi.

Films, each fiction and documentaries, that are shot within the wild typically increase an moral query: how do you seize nature with out violating it? Zoya was filmed throughout six days, throughout safaris and nature hikes, whereas the wildlife was captured from a distance throughout just a few recces earlier than the shoot. “We couldn’t treat those areas like any other film set, and had to shoot without interference,” shares Sethhi. The movie is shot with sensitivity in the direction of the forest, and that’s seen in Sethhi’s inclusion of intimate, but distant framing of animals.

The making of this brief movie concerned analysis on how tiger conservationists seize the actions of the beast, in addition to the inclusion of the method within the narrative. The technicality of the conservation strategies is easily woven within the narrative. It’s participating to look at how meticulously one can hint the presence of tigers within the vastness of a forest, but the protagonist’s repeated failure to take action, is a well timed reminder of nature’s higher hand over humanity.

Sereia is an adult female tiger shark weighing 478 lbs. She is 10 feet, 4 inches. BioPixel TV tagged her November 19th, 2018 in Pinnacles, Mozambique.

Sereia’s first ping was a few days later on November 29th, 2018 at 11:47p.m. She then traveled hundreds of miles north along the eastern coastline of Africa, past Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, and about half way past the coastline of Somalia. At this point Sereia did a 180 degree turn and swam back south along the coastline until she reached just offshore of the Tanzania/Mozambique border, where she turned east and begabe her record breaking journey across the Indian Ocean on September 10th, 2019.

Sereia’s next ping came 7 months later on April 10th, 2020 over 4,000 miles east of her previous position, on the east side of the Indian Ocean.

Her most recent ping was April 30th, 2020 which shows her swimming zig zag patterns well offshore of Singapore, up and down the NinetyEast ocean ridge, which is the longest and straightest ocean ridge in the world.

0,"KEY POINTS The carcass of a Ganges river dolphin was spotted by locals in Bangladesh

It had a sharp incision and its body fat had been removed

It is the second dolphin found dead in the sanctuary amid the coronavirus lockdown

On Sunday, authorities reported the discovery of the remains of an endangered river dolphin in a river sanctuary in Bangladesh. The find sparks fears of poaching amid the coronavirus lockdown.

The dolphin's remains were found on the bank of Halda River by locals from the town of Raojan, the local fishery department's Abdullah al Mamun told AFP. The creature had a sharp incision from its neck to its tail, and layers of its body fat had been removed.

Typically, the dolphins' layers of fat as well as their oil are sold to be used in traditional medicine, as many locals believe it can cure various diseases. In Bangladesh, however, it is illegal to kill Ganges river dolphins.

According to AFP, a local official who chose to stay anonymous reported locals have started to illegally fish since the usual authorities patrolling the region are busy enforcing the coronavirus lockdown. The nets trap the dolphins as well, making them easy targets for poachers who sell their fat and oil for high prices.

In fact, according to the outlet, Manzoorul Kibria of the Halda River Research Laboratory (HRRL) said this is the already the second dolphin to be found dead in the sanctuary since Bangladesh imposed the coronavirus-related lockdown.

Authorities are concerned about the possibility that more Ganges river dolphins could be killed.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources' latest assessment, Ganges river dolphins are considered endangered. This means they have a high risk of going extinct in the wild in the immediate future.

In fact, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), when the Ganges river dolphins were first officially discovered in 1801, they lived in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Now, however, they are already considered extinct in most of their original distribution ranges.

Because they live in one of the most densely populated places on Earth, they often die when they are caught as bycatch and when they are directly hunted for their meat and oil for medicinal use.

Apart from fishing, threats to the creatures include modifications of their habitat for dams and water management, which makes them susceptible to inbreeding and stops them from traveling long distances. Pollution from urban, industrial, military, agricultural and forestry waste also harms both the dolphins, which are the top predators in their habitat, as well as their prey.

Ganges river dolphin populations are now down to just 1,200 to 1,800 creatures, according to the WWF.",Carcass Of Endangered Dolphin In Bangladesh Sparks Poaching Fears,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlidGltZXMuY29tL2NhcmNhc3MtZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1kb2xwaGluLWJhbmdsYWRlc2gtc3BhcmtzLXBvYWNoaW5nLWZlYXJzLTI5NzM2ODLSAWFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pYnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jYXJjYXNzLWVuZGFuZ2VyZWQtZG9scGhpbi1iYW5nbGFkZXNoLXNwYXJrcy1wb2FjaGluZy1mZWFycy0yOTczNjgyP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2020/05/10/ganges-river-dolphin.jpg,2020-05-10,"{'sent': 'The carcass of a Ganges river dolphin was spotted by locals in Bangladesh\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Ganges'], 'GPE': ['Bangladesh']}}",Indus River Dolphin

The world is fighting with a deadly virus that is spreading rapidly. Many countries are under lockdown in a bid to reduce the further spread and flatten the curve. While humans are at home, nature and animals are captured, healing on many occasions. We have seen videos and pictures from across the countries, where animals and birds are seen reclaiming their habitats, without any fear. They are captured strolling freely on the empty streets. The sights are so beautiful! A while ago, there were reports that the rare South Asian River Dolphin, famously known as Ganges Dolphin was spotted near ghats in Kolkata, India. Thanks to the low water pollution levels, they are back. But it appears that humans are not happy with their return. Two men in Kolkata uploaded a video wherein they are seen torturing a dolphin on camera. While the exact location is not reported, the act disgraced the viewers. It is disturbing and disappointing. The incident reminds us of other gruesome instances that disgraced humanity.

These two men were caught literally torturing a young Gangetic dolphin to death. One of them, identified as Rafiku Saihk uploaded a video that showed a group of men holding the dolphin by its snout and tail, and torturing the fish. Another video, uploaded by the same user displayed the mammal being released into the river in a bloodied state. Noted environmentalist, Biswajit Roychowdhury has complained about it, urging the Principal Chief Conservator of Forest to take the matter under investigation. Although the exact location is not identified, Biswajit hopes the culprits will be punished.

“We are assuming that the place is in between Kolkata and Burdwan and hoping that the culprits will be brought to book soon,” he was quoted in TOI report. Biswajit added, “The mammals have very sensitive skin and the way it has been handled, as shown in the videos, it is likely to be dead despite being released in water.”

KATHMANDU: While International Nurses Day is being celebrated across the globe acknowledging nurses’ critical role in healthcare, one of the nurses working in Kapilvastu Hospital, Taulihawa, tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday. This is the first case in the country when a health worker has tested positive for the virus. She is among eight persons who tested positive in Kapilvastu.

“The 25-year-old nurse is a resident of Ward No 5 of Taulihawa. She used to go to the hospital from her home and return after finishing her duty,” said Ganesh Nepali, assistant chief district officer at the District Administration Office, Kapilvastu.

“Throat and nasal swabs of five of our health workers — two doctors, two nurses and an emergency in-charge — were collected four days ago. Since people from India have been crossing over clandestinely into Nepal and the hospital is near the (Nepal-India) border, we thought health workers faced risk of contracting COVID-19. We don’t want infected health workers to come in contact with patients unknowingly,” said Ratnakar Shukla, hospital manager at Kapilvastu Hospital. Health workers come in contact with up to 500 patients at the hospital daily.

According to the Ministry of Health and Population, more than 32,000 health professionals, including doctors, nurses and other health staff, have been working in government hospitals and health centres across the country.

Kathmandu, May 13

Nepal set up a border outpost at Chhangru in Darchula district today to guard the border and control cross-border crime.

According to Darchula Chief District Officer Yadu Nath Paudel, the government has deployed 25 Armed Police Force personnel at the outpost.

Darchula District Administration Office will also deploy 10 personnel of Nepal Police in Tinkar and Sitapul each tomorrow. Tinkar is close to Nepal’s border with China, while Sitapul is close to Nepal’s border with India.

The border outpost was established after India inaugurated a road from Pithoragarh to Mansarovar passing through Lipulekh.

APF personnel were airlifted in a Nepali Army helicopter from Khalanga, the headquarters of the district, to Chhangru. Nepal claims that Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani areas are Nepali territory. India has counter claims on these areas.

The team has carried enough food to last for six months. CDO Paudel said the government had established the border outpost at Chhangru in a rented house as the government did not have its own office building. He said the government had purchased 15 ropani land in Chhangru where it would soon start the process of constructing a permanent building where APF personnel would be stationed. The government has earmarked a budget of Rs 11 crore to construct a building for APF.

CDO Paudel, Indrajit Rai, security adviser to Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa, and APF AIG Narayan Babu Thapa accompanied APF men to Chhangru.

0,"Versatile hunters

Güiñas are one of eight species of Latin American small wildcat and are most closely related to ocelots, a better known species with a much bigger range—including parts of the southern United States.

As generalists, güiñas eat pretty much anything they can get their claws on—from marsupials to insects to frogs to birds. They especially like rodents, which are abundant in the thick understory. Agile climbers, the cats readily scramble up tree trunks to pluck woodpeckers and squirrels from their cavities. (A recent study showed they also prey on baby birds inside nest boxes.)

Güiñas also kill poultry if given a chance, and their reputation as henhouse raiders provokes farmers to kill them sometimes, says Jim Sanderson, who did his Ph.D. research on güiñas in Chile in 1997.

At the time, the species was “virtually unknown” to modern science, says Sanderson, now a program manager at Global Wildlife Conservation, a Texas-based nonprofit that works to protect rare wildlife.“We had a single photograph of one cat and specimens from 1919—the sum total of our knowledge,” he says. (See pictures of seven cats you never knew existed.)

During his research in Chiloe, an island off the Chilean coast, Sanderson found that simply patching up holes in henhouse chicken wire prevented the cats from getting in—an example, he says, of how working closely with local people can help a threatened species.

Farmers should welcome güiñas, which are “incredibly harmless” to people, says Luke Hunter, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Big Cats Program and author of the book Wild Cats of the World. One güiña can likely kill thousands of crop-raiding rodents a year. “They’re providing this undocumented benefit to anyone who has ever had a problem with rodents,” he says.

Losing their land

Retribution killings are less frequent these days, but güiñas still die as a result of attacks by free-ranging dogs, rodenticide poisoning, and car collisions. But the biggest threat by far, Sanderson says, is habitat loss and deforestation, particularly in central Chile.

Widespread cutting of forests to make way for commercial tree plantations, vineyards, and livestock rangelands has marooned the cats—which are too shy around humans to venture into the open and move between forest patches—in isolated groups.

“They depend on the native forest to exist,” says Vidal Mugica. “Protecting [it] is the main goal.”",Six-pound ‘mystery cat’ is Nat Geo photographer’s milestone species,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jby51ay9hbmltYWxzLzIwMjAvMDUvbXlzdGVyeS1jYXQtZ3VpbmEtbWlsZXN0b25lLXBob3RvLWFya9IBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jby51ay9hbmltYWxzLzIwMjAvMDUvbXlzdGVyeS1jYXQtZ3VpbmEtbWlsZXN0b25lLXBob3RvLWFyay9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.nationalgeographic.co.uk/files/styles/image_3200/public/screen-shot-2020-05-14-at-21.26.30.png?w=1600&h=900,2020-05-14,"{'sent': 'Versatile hunters\n\nGüiñas are one of eight species of Latin American small wildcat and are most closely related to ocelots, a better known species with a much bigger range—including parts of the southern United States.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Güiñas'], 'CARDINAL': ['eight', 'one'], 'GPE': ['United States']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"Use fewer paper products

As forests around the world disappear, with them go the habitats of many animals. Northern white-cheeked gibbons are approaching extinction in the wild as loggers clear significant portions of Southeast Asia’s evergreen forests to produce timber products like lumber and paper. Cotton-top tamarins, too, are losing their Amazonian habitats. Deforestation not only reduces the canopy cover that protects these primates from predation but also makes it harder for them to find food.

We can all help slow the rate of deforestation by simply using less paper and by using less paper overall and buying only paper with high recycled content, which drives down demand for virgin timber. Consider using cloth towels and napkins rather than paper, and opt to go electronic with all your paperwork. When you do need paper, look for those certified as sustainable by organisations like the Forest Stewardship Council.

Choose reusables rather than plastics

Opting for reusable products over single-use plastics doesn’t help only forest-dwellers; It also makes a difference for marine animals. Studies have shown that plastic waste washes into the ocean at a rate of 8.5 million tonnes a year, harming or even killing species—including loggerhead sea turtles, whose numbers have dwindled, in part, as they become entangled in or ingest discarded plastics.

But there’s lots we can do to help protect these marine environments. As reusable shopping bags and coffee cups have become ubiquitous, innovators in the fight to reduce plastic waste have stepped up their game, designing novel delivery systems—from returnable stainless steel ice-cream containers to vending machines that dispense food and cleaning products into reusable containers.

Recycle electronics

Many species rely on the forests of the Congo Basin for food and protection. Chimpanzees sleep and eat in the trees; western lowland gorillas feed on their bark and pulp; and okapi use the dense vegetation to evade predators and poachers alike. But mining operations are destroying these forests to extract minerals such as coltan—used in making electronics like cell phones and laptops.

You don’t have to give up your gadgets to help protect these animals. Just be sure to recycle your electronics, through a certified responsible recycler, at their end of life. Processors will strip out their coltan, gold, tin, and tungsten so they can be used in new equipment, thus reducing demand for new mining.

Think as you shop

Checking labels as you browse the aisles of your local supermarket can make a difference for a variety of animals and habitats. For example, avoiding products that contain palm oil—which goes by many different names and shows up in a range of household products, from pizza dough to lipstick—can help support Sumatran tigers, whose tropical rainforests have shrunk by nearly 20 percent as oil palm plantations have expanded in Indonesia.

Buying shade-grown coffee not only helps to preserve the forest canopy that shelters coffee plants, it also protects the habitat of giant anteaters, the most threatened mammals in Central America, and a variety of bird species.",These 50 animals are in peril.

0,"New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: National Endangered Species Day is observed in India every year on the third Friday of May to raise awareness about endangered species and about wildlife in the country as India is one of the richest bio-diversities in the world, having many species endemic to its soil. As we observe National Endangered Species Day, here is a list of five endangered species that is endemic to Indian terrains:

The Ganges shark:

Scientifically called Glyphis gangeticus, the Ganga shark is one among the drastically vanishing species of sharks in India. It found in the lower river beds of Ganga and the Brahmaputra. The Ganga Sharks are also found in parts of Bangladesh. The fish is traded for its oil and jaws and consequently, its population is constantly declining.

The great Indian Bustard:

It is among the rarest heavy birds to fly but yet it couldn't please the human realm enough with its talent. The bird is found in the Thar Desert, which is also known as the Great Indian Desert, and is on the verge of extinction with a population of mere 150 individuals.

Himalayan Brown Bear:

A brown bear is not endemic to India but the one found in the Himalayas is. It is one of the largest terrestrial animals on the earth. The animal is poached for its fur, organs, medicinal purposes and also by the natives of Himalayas to prevent their cattle from its threat.

Peacock Tarantula:

It is one of the prettiest and rarest species of spiders present on the earth and is found in Andhra Pradesh. The reason for its decline is the trade of timber along with its introduction to the pet markets of south India where the spider couldn't sustain.

Gharial:

The gharial is commonly called 'fish-eating crocodile' which is a misnomer as it is not a breed of a crocodile but rather a different species. The reptilian is unique and inclusive in India.

South Asian River Dolphins (also known as Ganges Dolphins) Image Credit: Twitter

Animals are paying a price for tasting freedom during the COVID-19 lockdown. Just last month, videos went viral in India, showing South Asian River Dolphins (also known as Ganges Dolphins) finally returning to the valleys of West Bengal. But, another video went viral this week, showing an infant dolphin being tortured, after it was caught by a group of men.

According to a report on indiatimes.com: ""Last month, Biswajit Roy Chowdhury, a senior environmental activist stated he spotted a couple of dolphins at Babughat in Kolkata. Unfortunately, the appearance of this rare animal has already led to cases of poaching and cruelty. Recently, a young gangetic dolphin was tortured to death by a group of young men in Kolkata.""

Apparently, the incident came to light after a person named Rafiku Saihk uploaded a video that showed a group of men holding the dolphin by its snout and tailing and torturing it.

The report soon went viral, sparking fury especially among animal activists and lovers.

Twitter users, shared the video and asked authorities including animal rights organisations to take immediate action, to punish the perpetrators of this crime.

Tweep @Akri200 posted: ""It seems lockdown hasn’t been able to root out the ‘viruses’ responsible for the disappearance of the dolphins from river in first place. Young #gangetic #Dolphin was literally tortured to death by bunch of young men.""

Reportedly, the exact location of the incident is not confirmed yet.

A later video showed the dolphin being released in the river in a bloodied state.

According to the Times of India, environmentalist, Biswajit Roychowdhury's organization has complained about it to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and the matter is under investigation. He added that the dolphin in the video is an infant, probably a few weeks old.

“We are assuming that the place is in between Kolkata and Burdwan and hoping that the culprits will be brought to book soon,” Biswajit said, according to the report.

""The mammals have very sensitive skin and the way it has been handled, as shown in the videos, it is likely to be dead despite being released in water,” he added.

The global population of Gangetic dolphins is barely between 1,200 to 1,800.

Indiatimes.com reported that, ""In 2017, a team experts from the Worldwide Fund for Nature-India mapped the abundance of and threats to Gangetic dolphins in the Hooghly. One of the most 'striking features' of the study was that the endangered mammals were sighted in highly polluted pockets of the river. The study found that apart from pollution, one of the biggest threats to the existence of dolphins in the Hoogly river was human activity and transport.""

The Ganges river dolphin is typically found in the river systems of Nepal, Bangladesh and India. It can weigh up to 100 kilograms (220 pounds) and grow to up to 2.6 metres (eight feet) long. They are known for their long beaks which have 28 sharp teeth on both sides of their jaws.

The stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the most iconic and popular tourist attractions in London, but did you know it was once home to exotic animals?

Lions, polar bears and elephants once lived on the site, as it was a zoo.

The exotic animals had never been seen before in the capital, so visitors flocked to there.

The Tower menagerie began as a result of medieval monarchs exchanging rare and strange animals as gifts. Lion sculptures, and other animal installations on site commemorate the former inhabitants of the Tower.

In 1235, Henry III was delighted to be presented with three 'leopards' - probably lions but referred to as leopards in the heraldry on the king's shield - by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. These inspired the King to start a zoo at the Tower.

Over time the collection of animals grew to a vast variety.

The lions were joined by a polar bear in 1252 and an African elephant in 1255.

The King of France sent an elephant to the Tower in 1255, and Londoners flocked ‘to see the novel sight’.

Although the elephant had a brand new 40 foot by 20 foot elephant house and a dedicated keeper, it sadly died after a couple of years.

Many of the other animals did not survive in the cramped conditions, although lions and tigers fared better, with many cubs being born.

The lost lion tower

In the 1300s, visitors to the Tower would have first crossed a drawbridge to the Lion Tower, which was demolished in the 1800s named after the big cats kept there.

By 1622, the collection had been extended to include three eagles, two pumas, a tiger and a jackal, as well as more lions and leopards, which were the main attractions.

James I had the lions’ den refurbished, so that visitors could see more of the lions prowling around their circular yard. He improved the lions’ living quarters, so that visitors could look down and see ‘the great cisterne ... for the Lyons to drink and wash themselfes in’.

In later centuries some animals took their revenge on those who got too close, maiming and even killing zoo keepers, soldiers and visitors.

In 1252, Henry III was given a magnificent white bear, presumably a polar bear, by the King of Norway.

Although it was kept muzzled and chained, the bear was allowed to swim and hunt for fish in the Thames.

A collar and a ‘stout cord’ were attached to the bear to keep it from escaping.

The closing of the zoo

By the beginning of the 19th century the Menagerie was in a state of decline. However, it was then revitalised by the energetic showman Alfred Cops, Head Keeper.

He acquired over 300 specimens and rekindled the popularity of the Tower as a tourist attraction. But there were concerns over animal welfare, seeing as the RSPCA was founded in 1824, and the nuisance factor and expense of the animals finally led to its closure.

But the spirit of the Menagerie lives on, as the original 150 animals at London Zoo came from the Tower.","The forgotten Tower of London zoo that was home to lions, polar bears and elephants",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm15bG9uZG9uLm5ld3Mvd2hhdHMtb24vd2hhdHMtb24tbmV3cy9mb3Jnb3R0ZW4tdG93ZXItbG9uZG9uLXpvby1ob21lLTE4MjczMDU50gFdaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubXlsb25kb24ubmV3cy93aGF0cy1vbi93aGF0cy1vbi1uZXdzL2ZvcmdvdHRlbi10b3dlci1sb25kb24tem9vLWhvbWUtMTgyNzMwNTkuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i2-prod.mylondon.news/incoming/article18273064.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_tower-of-london-zoo.jpg,2020-05-18,"{'sent': 'The stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site is one of the most iconic and popular tourist attractions in London, but did you know it was once home to exotic animals?\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['UNESCO World Heritage Site'], 'CARDINAL': ['one'], 'GPE': ['London']}}",Tiger

Virunga National Park needs $2 million (€1.8 million) in funding to stay afloat after suffering an attack in April of this year. A suspected Rwandan militia group allegedly killed 12 park rangers in the ambush. Ever since, the lack of security patrols has put the endangered mountain gorilla population at even greater risk.

In light of the covid-19 pandemic, gorillas are facing further challenges. Scientists worry that the health crisis poses an “existential threat” towards the survival of the species.

""Virunga urgently needs funds to protect the endangered mountain gorilla population, to provide support to the rangers and the families of rangers who have fallen in the line of duty, and to help deliver essential disease prevention efforts,"" the actor told BBC News.

""I had the great honour of meeting and supporting Virunga's courageous team in their fight against illegal oil drilling in 2013,"" he said.

DiCaprio has announced that he is donating towards the Virunga Fund via his organisation Earth Alliance. In a recent Instagram post, he wrote, “The future of Virunga hangs in the balance as it deals with the impacts of Ebola and COVID-19, and now this recent attack.”

Other contributors to the fund include the Emerson Collective, Global Wildlife Conservation and the European Commission.

Why save Virunga National Park?

Virunga National Park is the oldest nature reserve in Africa and a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world and home to the endangered mountain gorilla. In total, the park provides a habitat for several hundred species of birds, reptiles and mammals.

Two active volcanoes located in the park, Mount Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira, have helped shape its unique ecosystem. Over 3,000 species of flora and fauna have been recorded so far, including animals like the blue-headed tree agama, the African elephant and the golden monkey, which is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List.

The Gorilla Organization is a UK-based charity working to protect our closest living relatives. Today, there are fewer than 1,200 mountain gorillas left in the world, so the charity encourages the public to adopt a gorilla for £3 a month to help save them from the threat of extinction.

They are building a ‘Gorilla safe zone’ in the DR of Congo basin rainforest by planting millions of trees.

0,"KOLKATA/DHAKA: Authorities in eastern India and Bangladesh were relocating tens of thousands of villagers away from the coastline on Tuesday ahead of a super cyclone that is expected to inflict large-scale damage as both countries struggle to contain the coronavirus.

Coronavirus quarantine shelters in India were being converted to cyclone shelters, leaving authorities to manage social distancing to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus.

In neighbouring Bangladesh officials were moving people to higher ground and urged them to maintain social distance and wear masks as the country has recorded over 20,995 coronavirus cases and 314 deaths so far.

India‘s weather office said the Super Cyclone Amphan had reached winds of up to 240 kmh (145 mph) with gusts of around 265 kph (165 mph) over the Bay of Bengal on Monday night and was expected to make a landfall on Wednesday.

Such wind speeds, according to weather officials, could make Amphan one of the biggest storms to hit Indian in about a decade.

The cyclone comes as India eased the world’s biggest lockdown imposed in April to contain the coronavirus which has infected more than 100,000 people and killed 3,163.

The states of Odisha and West Bengal were moving families to more than 1,000 shelters in government offices and educational centres and were hastily converting coronavirus quarantine centres into cyclone shelters.

“We have just about six hours left to evacuate people from their homes and we also have to maintain social distancing norms…the cyclone could wash away thousands of huts and standing crop,” S.G. Rai, an official in federal disaster management office told Reuters on Tuesday.

Trains plying thousands of migrant workers from the Indian capital New Delhi to eastern states, after the coronavirus lockdown of the country’s rail system was eased, were diverted to avoid the cyclone’s path.

India, with a coastline of 7,516 km (4,670 miles), experiences more than a tenth of all the world’s tropical cyclones, the bulk of them on its eastern coast.

In neighbouring Bangladesh, officials intensified rescue operations as the cyclone could trigger the worst storm in about 15 years along the country’s low-lying coast.

Bangladesh’s coastal districts may experience flooding from tidal waves and heavy rainfall with winds packing speeds of up to 160 kph (98 mph) is expected during the cyclone.

“We have prepared 12,000 cyclone centres, where more than 5 million people can take shelter. We have also taken necessary steps so that people can maintain distance and wear masks,” said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management and relief in the capital Dhaka.

Bangladesh’s coast, home to 30 million people is also regularly battered by cyclones that have killed hundreds of thousands of people in recent decades.","Tens of thousands evacuated as India, Bangladesh brace for super cyclone",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGltYWxheWFudGltZXMuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC90ZW5zLW9mLXRob3VzYW5kcy1ldmFjdWF0ZWQtYXMtaW5kaWEtYmFuZ2xhZGVzaC1icmFjZS1mb3Itc3VwZXItY3ljbG9uZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://thehimalayantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cyclone-Amphan.jpg,2020-05-19,"{'sent': 'Authorities in eastern India and Bangladesh were relocating tens of thousands of villagers away from the coastline on Tuesday ahead of a super cyclone that is expected to inflict large-scale damage as both countries struggle to contain the coronavirus.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Bangladesh', 'India'], 'CARDINAL': ['tens of thousands']}}",Indus River Dolphin
0,"Archaeologists from the University of Tübingen and the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution have discovered the almost complete remains of a Eurasian straight-tusked forest elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus) from a Palaeolithic site near Schöningen, Germany.

The elephant died on what was the western lakeshore 300,000 which is now the site of a former opencast lignite mine. The remains have been well-preserved due to the water-saturated sediments.

Jordi Serangeli, head of the project excavations said: “We found both 2.3-metre-long tusks, the complete lower jaw, numerous vertebrae and ribs as well as large bones belonging to three of the legs and even all five delicate hyoid bones.”

The elephant has been identified as an older female with worn teeth that had a shoulder height of around 3.2 metres and weighed 6.8 tones – much larger than African elephant cows today.

Archaeozoologist Ivo Verheijen said: “It most probably died of old age and not as a result of human hunting. Elephants often remain near and in water when they are sick or old. Numerous bite marks on the recovered bones show that carnivores visited the carcass, however, the hominins of that time would have profited from the elephant too.”

The team found 30 small flint flakes and two long bones which were used as tools for knapping among the elephant bones. This included micro flakes embedded into bone which shows that re-sharpening of stone artefacts took place near to the elephant remains.

The discoveries in Schöningen include some of the oldest fossil finds of an auroch in Europe, of a water buffalo and three sabre-toothed cats. In Schöningen archaeologists also recovered some of the world’s oldest and best-preserved hunting weapons: ten wooden spears and at least one throwing stick.

Stone artefacts and bone tools complete the overall picture of the technology of the time. “The lakeshore sediments of Schöningen offer unique preservation and frequently provide us with detailed and important insights into the culture of Homo heidelbergensis,” says Nicholas Conard, head of the Schöningen research project.

Further detailed analyses of the environmental and climatic conditions at the time of the elephant’s death are taking place at the Technische Universität Braunschweig, the University of Lüneburg and the University of Leiden (The Netherlands). The excavations in Schöningen are financed by the Ministry of Science and Culture of Lower Saxony.

Kobe, May 20 (Jiji Press)--The city of Kobe, western Japan, said Tuesday that it will return a female giant panda to China as her lease expires on July 15.

The panda, Tan Tan, came to Kobe Oji Zoo in Hyogo Prefecture in 2000 in response to a request made by the then Kobe mayor after the city was hit hard by a massive earthquake in 1995.

Tan Tan came to the zoo under a 10-year lease but her stay had been extended even after her breeding partner, Kou Kou, died.

Kobe has asked for another extension, but the Chinese side said the aging panda should be taken care of at a place with a better natural environment, according to city officials.

Tan Tan is set to be sent to a conservation research center in Sichuan Province. But the timing has yet to be decided as direct flights to the province have been halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The best news is that these AR tigers won’t ever miss their mothers, feel pain or distress, or lash out in frustration the way real tigers used for entertainment do.

What Do Tigers Used in Photo Ops Have to Endure?

In nature, tiger cubs stay with their protective and nurturing mothers for up to two years, but those used for photo ops are torn away from their mothers when they’re just hours, days, or weeks old. Like any other young animals (including human babies), tiger cubs require a lot of sleep, but ones in captivity are often not afforded adequate rest. Cold and heat stress, malnutrition, exhaustion, and infectious diseases affect many of these likely terrified cubs, particularly the youngest ones, whose immune systems aren’t fully developed yet.

Once cubs grow beyond photo-op age (which is, at most, when they’re only a few months old), most are relegated to dingy cages in roadside zoos and sometimes used for breeding to perpetuate the cycle. Some are even killed.

Take Action for Tigers

Did you know that big cats have a unique hyoid bone and large vocal cords that allow them to emit a deep, fierce roar? You could hear a tiger roaring from up to 2 miles away—and that’s as close as you’d ever need to be. Please, never visit roadside zoos, marine parks, or any other businesses that profit from exploiting animals.

KATHMANDU: The Government of Nepal, in a follow-up of its recent decision to endorse the issuance of a new political map incorporating Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani, has officially unveiled the map today.

Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation had presented the new geographical map of Nepal comprising the disputed lands at Singha Durbar. Minister Padma Kumari Aryal officially announced the release of the map to public on the national broadcasting channel Nepal Television.

Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Chief Advisor Bishnu Rimal took to Twitter to share the news of official issuance of the map prepared by the Ministry of Land Management.

The new political map was tabled for approval in the cabinet meeting held on May 18, which had ended with endorsement of the issuance of the map.

President Bidya Devi Bhandari and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, both, had recently made official announcements at the Federal Parliament regarding the unveiling of the new geographical representation of the country incorporating the territories encroached by India.

The Government of India had unilaterally inaugurated a link road to Mansarovar in Tibet of China via Nepali territory, which had refuelled tensions between the two neighbouring countries, leading to a statement war of sorts.

In addition to its official release, the Ministry is yet to bring its coat of arms and logo into use as per the updated map, for which, it is preparing to present a bill in the parliament, seeking an amendment to the constitution’s index.

One sunny morning in 1974, when Carol Buckley was 20, her German shepherd began barking at the bay window of her rental house in suburban Simi Valley, California. Buckley looked out to see a man walking a baby elephant down the street on a rope. She blinked. Then she ran outside and chased him down. The man, Bob Nance, boasted a mini-menagerie at his tire shop and had purchased the six-month-old Burmese elephant as his star attraction. Just three feet tall, with a scruffy tuft of hair on her head like an Old English Sheepdog, the calf was named Fluffie.

Buckley was studying exotic-animal management at the nearby Moorpark College, and she began showing up daily at Bob’s Tire Center. She wasn’t exactly summoned, but Nance didn’t complain. Buckley mucked the small truck where Fluffie lived, protected her from taunting kids, and fed her from a bottle. When Buckley arrived each morning, Fluffie would take her long, strong trunk, grab Buckley’s nose, and exhale, greeting her like she would another elephant. Soon, Buckley was driving Fluffie back to her own house at night, backing the truck up to the window so they could see each other when Buckley was inside. At the time, she didn’t know much about elephants, but she figured she could do better than Bob Nance, who eventually hired her as Fluffie’s caretaker. She read books and consulted her professors and the local vet. After a few months, Buckley quit school to spend all her time with her ward.

Two years later, with the help of her parents, Buckley secured a $25,000 loan to purchase the animal, renaming her Tarra, a name she found “exotic and grand.” For Buckley, who had one short-lived marriage at 24 and never had children, Tarra became her family. She thought they would be together for the rest of their lives.

On a recent bluebird January day, Buckley bumped along at the wheel of a camouflage Kawasaki Mule on a red clay road in the most southwestern reaches of Georgia. The old farm is not unlike those around it, a mix of rolling grasslands, carefully culled pines, gnarly live oaks, and meandering paths to spring-fed streams and ponds. Buckley pointed out whitetail deer, wild hogs, and goldfinches that darted from the tawny brush.

“And when you get down there,” she sang, motoring toward Little Attapulgus Creek, “it’s just heaven for elephants.” The fields made way for hardwoods and a cool, boggy streambed. She sprung from the Mule and opened her arms wide and smiled, closing her eyes and inhaling like a blissed-out yogi. A tiny stick hung in a tangle of her long, fine, sandy-colored hair, a souvenir from a bushwacking gallop down a hillside. The calm lasted only a moment. The Mule was stuck in the mud. After Buckley exerted considerable revving and pushing, the tour continued on foot. At 65 years old, the diminutive Buckley, with a tanned complexion that shows little wear for a lifetime spent outdoors, still clocks a brisk pace.

On these 850 acres in Decatur County near Attapulgus (population 449), Buckley has created a refuge for retired circus and zoo elephants, nearly 25 years after she founded the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee with a similar mission. That nonprofit, located southwest of Nashville, rescued 24 elephants and grew to 2,700 acres and assets of well over $20 million under Buckley’s tenure before a great rift formed between her and the board of directors and she was ousted in 2010. She lost her job, her home, her life’s work, and Tarra. So here she is, starting all over again, with plans to get her friend back.

Less than a year after being booted from the Tennessee operation, Buckley launched Elephant Aid International, a nonprofit dedicated to improving the lives of captive pachyderms in Asia. Since then, she has traveled overseas as much as half the year, working with NGOs and governments in Nepal, Thailand, and India to improve the habitats, healthcare, and treatment of elephants used for work and tourism, while raising money and searching for the perfect U.S. property for a new refuge and headquarters. On her list of requirements: hundreds of rolling acres with shade and meadow, abundant grasses and forage, and a subtropical climate, all to mimic the native habitats of Asian elephants. Southwest Georgia fit the bill, and she closed on the property for $2.4 million in 2016.

EAI has functioned mostly with a staff of one and thousands of supporters, including hundreds who followed Buckley in the split with the Tennessee sanctuary, many of whom now make up EAI’s board and advisory council. After all, it was she who dreamed up that first Tennessee haven 25 years ago and started it using her own money, with Tarra as its founding resident. Along with her one-time romantic partner and cofounder Scott Blais, she oversaw every aspect of the facility. But by 2009, complaints about her management style, squabbles over spending, health scares, and the death of a caregiver had turned the organization into a cesspool of feuding factions.

Now, down in South Georgia, 60,000 feet of specialized steel cable fencing encloses the habitat for Buckley’s latest endeavor, Elephant Refuge North America, an initiative of EAI. Crews of contractors and volunteers helped clear the land, cut out the old cattle fencing, and removed downed trees. Buckley herself can get lost in the quiet satisfaction of pulling a bush hog, and savanna-like grasses have sprung up in place of brambles. There’s a 5,000-square-foot barn with infrared heating and soft estuary sand dug four feet deep to cushion the pachyderms’ platter-sized padded feet. All told, the compound, which was completed in March 2019, cost $3.75 million, all from donations. Live-streaming cameras across the property allow the public to view as many as 10 rescued and retired elephants, otherwise largely free from the human gaze, roaming the pastoral grounds, splashing in the ponds, trumpeting to their friends and family.

But for now, all viewers see is trees swaying in the wind. As yet, there are no elephants at the Elephant Refuge North America.

The elephant, both Asian and African species, is among the world’s most intelligent creatures. They exhibit sophisticated emotions and behaviors like altruism, grief, and cooperation, and have been seen helping each other up muddy banks or spraying dust on a companion’s wounds. The animals’ hippocampus, which is linked to emotion and memory, is especially large, thus the saying “an elephant never forgets.” Their families, led by a matriarch, may be the most closely knit in the animal kingdom, with familial females spending their entire lives together. (Most captive elephants are female; bulls periodically enter “musth,” when heightened testosterone can make them aggressive, so adult males tend to lead more solitary lives.) When a loved one dies, elephants may perform funeral rituals, touching the body softly with their feet, carrying away the bones, or covering them in leaves and grass. In 1999, retired circus elephants Jenny and Shirley, who hadn’t seen each other in more than two decades, were filmed reuniting at the Tennessee sanctuary. So eager were the pair to touch that they bent the thick steel bars separating them on the first night. Elephants have shown similar affection for companions of other species, including humans.

There are around 300 elephants in zoos in the U.S., and perhaps 70 owned by circuses, but public opinion about holding these complex creatures captive has evolved since the days when a tire shop could legally house a pachyderm as a mascot.

Circus elephants spend much of their time confined in trucks or chained in stalls, forced to obey or suffer the bullhook, a notorious baton with an end like a fire poker. In 2016, after decades of protest and a slew of local laws prohibiting elephant acts, Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey, the nation’s largest circus, retired its elephants to a company reserve in Florida. Since then, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and California have banned elephant circus acts altogether.

Conditions for zoo elephants have improved over the past two decades, most significantly since the Association of Zoos & Aquariums started requiring exhibits to house at least three elephants (in correspondingly larger habitats) in order to be accredited. Last year, Zoo Atlanta opened its expanded exhibit, the Zambezi Elephant Center, and introduced Msholo, an African male from the San Diego Zoo, to its two females, Kelly and Tara. Still, elephant populations in zoos are dwindling; the animals’ record of breeding in captivity is dismal and capture from the wild is highly controversial. Faced with new AZA directives, some institutions are phasing out exhibits, while others stay open without accreditation, housing solitary elephants in cramped conditions, a depressing fate for the biologically social, roaming animal. The AZA also has banned the routine use of bullhooks by 2023. AZA-certified zoos contribute millions of dollars each year to the conservation of wild elephants in Asia and Africa, where the animal is threatened by habitat destruction and poaching. Still, some experts now question whether elephants belong in zoos at all, even as many zoos are enjoying record attendance.

Buckley, for her part, wishes to partner with zoos rather than clash with them. Equal parts realistic and quixotic, Buckley ultimately views the sanctuary model as a transition to a day when elephants live only where nature intended—in the wild. When she founded the Tennessee sanctuary, it was the first of its kind in the U.S. In the beginning, she just wanted a home for Tarra.

Settled in the living room of her spare Georgia farmhouse on the new refuge grounds, Buckley recalled her saga with Tarra. She has lived on the property for three years, but the room was empty except for a few mismatched chairs and Nepali trinkets. Moving boxes were still stacked against the wall. “I didn’t realize I was going to have to create the place that would be good for her,” she said. “I thought, On my journey, I’m going to turn a corner and, oh, here’s a great place for elephants. And then I realized, Oh, there is no great place for elephants. Nobody has done that, so I’ve got to do it myself.”

After she launched the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee, it didn’t take long for the other elephants from small zoos and traveling circuses to arrive, many bearing scars, fears, injuries, disease, or even old ankle chains, and they thrived in their newfound freedom and friendships. As president and CEO, Buckley oversaw the retirement of two dozen elephants, including the first rescue confiscated by the USDA and another eight stripped at once from the Hawthorn Corporation, a provider of circus elephants. The sanctuary prompted widespread discussion about improving the animals’ lives in captivity, and Buckley’s work was recognized by National Geographic and Oprah.

But Buckley’s 45-year career with elephants didn’t start in animal welfare. It began under the big top.

Buckley grew up one of six in Orange County, California, at the edge of a post-war housing tract backing up to acres of fields. As a child, she trained German shepherds and collected chickens, geese, and rabbits. At community college, she met a guy who worked at a nearby wild animal amusement park. He asked her out on a date. She agreed to go if he would introduce her to his boss. After an informal visit, the park director offhandedly invited her to “come back any time”—and she did. Every day for months, following the dolphin and sea lion trainers like a shadow. The director eventually convinced her to apply to Moorpark.

Just a week after she enrolled, baby Tarra lumbered into her life.

Buckley began teaching her tricks. This was the land of Disney, and regional theme parks dotted seemingly every corner of the state. Traveling carnivals with whirly-gigs and acrobats and top hat–wearing tiger trainers pulled their trucks from town to town. Buckley and Tarra’s first job was with Marriott’s Great America in Santa Clara—now California’s Great America—where they landed a two-year contract. Buckley rented a 10-acre place nearby for them to live.

Theirs was a classic circus routine. Tarra would dance on a tub (“ba ba ba,” Buckley demonstrated, straightening her back and putting her hands through a little cha-cha), play the xylophone, waltz, wiggle the hula in a grass skirt. Maquillaged and sporting Farrah Fawcett locks and a tight leotard, Buckley conducted the performance with a tap here and there of a fiberglass wand. The duo were famous for strapping on roller skates—both of them. The pair took their act all over the country and Canada, living and sleeping together in Buckley’s trailer, Buckley in a tiny cubby over the gooseneck and Tarra in the custom-built bed.

Buckley insisted that for a time, when she and Tarra were young, they both enjoyed performing. “She was a kid,” she said. “The more people would cheer, the sillier she would get. She’s hyper—like me.”

In the late ’70s, the pair moved out to a sunny canyon in the Los Padres National Forest near Ojai. They bathed in the deep pools of the Ventura River, wandered trails, and curled up to rest under ancient oaks. By then Tarra was doing some studio work. She appeared in an episode of Little House on the Prairie, and Carol Burnett rode on her back in the final medley of Annie. She delivered the envelope with the winner for “Best Costume Design” at the 57th Academy Awards when A Passage to India was nominated. But travel was becoming arduous. Circus stunts began to feel cheap. Tarra was growing up—and Buckley was growing with her.

“It was a hard life,” says Buckley. “Tarra had fun when she was little, but as she started physically getting bigger and her maturity level was changing, her likes and dislikes were shifting. I felt like every day, I went to bed going, Okay, I’ve learned this much about her. And then the next day, Okay. I’m learning more. Learning more. She was forever changing. She was growing all that time, and I was like three steps behind her every time, trying to stay up with her. She was 10 in 1984, and I said, That’s it. No more circus.”

Given that elephants can live for decades—70 years or more—Tarra was still an adolescent. For years, they tried zoos, offering Tarra as an attraction and Buckley as a caregiver. At the Racine Zoo on the shores of Lake Michigan in Wisconsin, Tarra bonded with a solitary female elephant, Rasha. With the blessing of the zoo director, Buckley planned an expansion and renovation of the habitat. During the construction, she moved the two elephants to a breeding center at a wildlife park near Toronto, hoping both would return pregnant. In Canada, Buckley met Scott Blais, who was then a 19-year-old elephant trainer, 20 years her junior. The two began dreaming about a better life for captive elephants and then—after striking up a romance—about a future together, too.

Tarra did become pregnant, but a new director at the Racine Zoo fired Buckley. With a baby elephant on the way, she and Blais had no trouble finding a new home at the Nashville Zoo. In 1994, Tarra delivered a calf. But after a difficult and frightening labor, the baby emerged with its lower body twisted and contorted from a crippling joint deformity called arthrogryposis. After about 20 minutes, the vet announced, “the baby is gone.” Tarra put one foot gently on the body, paused, then walked away.

“I just couldn’t accept it,” Buckley said. “I was really messed up over it. I was the one in mourning. I was sleeping in the barn with Tarra, and she’s going, Come on, it’s okay. She did great. She helped me through it.”

The vet assured Buckley that Tarra was young and could try again. But she told him, “I will never ever do that to her again.” After years of dreaming of a sanctuary for elephants, that was all the push she needed. Soon after, she used her savings to buy 112 acres and a house in rural Hohenwald, Tennessee, 80 miles southwest of Nashville.

“I don’t regret what Tarra and I have been through,” she said, “but I often think about, Oh, how fabulous would it have been if when I first met Tarra, I already knew everything I know now and she never had to do any of that. But that’s how I gained the knowledge and the experience to do what I am doing well.” And if Tarra had never been captured at all? “If she could have her life back? Oh, man. I’d give it all up in a minute.”

It has been five years since Buckley has seen Tarra, now somewhat beyond middle age, the subject of a bitter custody battle with the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee that has shaken conservation and animal-welfare circles. The opposing parties met in court most recently last April to determine Tarra’s rightful and permanent home.

The events leading up to Buckley’s dismissal in 2010 had compounded over several years. In 1997, Buckley sold the property, including its improvements and her residence, to the nonprofit for her purchase price. Buckley and Blais lived together on the grounds, working around the clock, seven days a week, for no pay for years. But as the organization grew, Buckley found that, as president and CEO, she was managing staff—eventually as many as three-dozen employees—as much as caring for elephants.

“In many ways, we were a victim of our own success,” said Blais. “We grew exponentially. It could be chaotic.”

For Buckley, understanding elephants is easy. “Elephants are an open book completely,” she said. “They don’t hide anything, they don’t fake anything.” It’s humans who are hard. “People are quite confusing to me. I cannot read people at all.”

She was surprised when new, young staffers asked for Christmas vacation or pricey benefits packages. For her, the elephants always came first.

There was one employee whose commitment matched Buckley’s: caregiver Joanna Burke. The soft-spoken Massachusetts native’s devotion verged on obsession, to the point where she broke off a 10-year relationship and rarely left the grounds. Buckley saw Burke as her successor.

Burke had been at the sanctuary for eight years when, in 2006, she was bathing an elephant named Winkie, who had arrived six years earlier from a Wisconsin zoo with a reputation for violent behavior. Without warning, Winkie struck Burke with her trunk and stepped on her, killing her instantly. Blais was with Burke at the time and suffered bruises and a broken ankle trying to save her. Burke’s family agreed with Buckley that Burke would not have wanted Winkie euthanized. (Winkie lived until 2017.)

It wasn’t until the accident that Buckley learned Burke and Blais had become romantically involved. The relationship between the cofounders, already soured, turned toxic. Buckley and Blais wouldn’t speak without a mediator, and both attest many staffers sided with the young, affable Blais. Buckley admits to being an uncompromising manager. “They were afraid of me,” she says. “Absolutely.”

“For years, she said she did not belong managing people,” recalled Blais. “She has an incredible mind, an incredible spirit, but I think she doesn’t know when to step back.”

Not long after, Buckley found herself at odds with the board, opposing spending on a glossy elephant education center in downtown Hohenwald and over a tuberculosis outbreak that infected eight employees, though none fell ill.

In 2009, Blais threatened to quit, and the board placed Buckley on leave. Rejecting offers of lesser roles, she also refused to resign, then was fired in March 2010. Blais was persuaded to stay, although he left the following year, married another former staffer, and now works with elephants in Brazil.

Buckley was devastated and blindsided, she said. That October, she sued for wrongful dismissal, unauthorized use of her name and likeness, breach of contract, and defamation, seeking $1 million in damages and visitation rights with Tarra.

In February 2011, the sanctuary responded to Buckley’s allegations, asking the court to dismiss the suit and denying all charges. In a statement, it said, “Ms. Buckley created what workers described as a toxic work environment” and that she “neglected worker safety concerns.”

Donors, a board member, members of the advisory board, and even some staffers broke ties with the organization, pledging to follow her. “I was on the phone taking minutes for the board meeting when they announced they were removing her,” said Kate Elliott, who was the sanctuary’s managing director from 2006 to 2009 and is now a supporter of Elephant Aid International. “I was sick to my stomach. It was completely out of left field.”

Elephant experts from conservationists in Kenya to animal psychologists wrote letters to the board of directors in Buckley’s defense. One was Dr. Rob Atkinson, who at the time served as head of wildlife at Britain’s Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. “There is only one place I personally would want a captive elephant to live, and that is with Carol at the Sanctuary,” he wrote. “Carol has underpinned the Sanctuary’s work with a deep, ethically sound philosophy which gives it its strength. The elephants and the Sanctuary need Carol’s skill, heart, and wisdom. I have met elephant carers all over the world, and been one myself, but I have never met anyone like Carol.” That fall, Atkinson himself was hired as CEO of the Elephant Sanctuary. He resigned less than two years later and was succeeded by Janice Zeitlin, a Nashville art dealer who has been on the board since 2004. Zeitlin declined to comment for this story.

Following a dip in donations after Buckley’s departure, the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee has continued to thrive financially. In 2018, it raised more money than ever—nearly $10 million—and now has assets of almost $50 million and top ratings from Charity Navigator. Staff includes 20 caregivers, and it remains the largest natural habitat refuge for elephants in North America. The new Elephant Discovery Center, with its interactive exhibits, opened last year, bringing student groups and tourists to tiny Hohenwald; and the nonprofit’s distance-learning program reached more than 14,000 students in 26 countries in 2019. But over the past 10 years, the herd has shrunk to 11, with seven deaths and four arrivals.

Initially, Buckley believed the best place for Tarra was still the sanctuary, even if she could not live there with her. “If she were happy, why would I move her?” Buckley was granted a property inspection to visit Tarra; but that reunion was so traumatic for Buckley that she revised her lawsuit in 2014, dropping all other charges aside from custody of Tarra. During her next visit in 2015, she stayed in the car, watching Tarra from a distance. Now, she does not even watch Tarra on the EleCam. “The next time I see her, I’m bringing her home,” she said.

Litigation over Tarra drags on. In Tennessee’s Lewis County chancery court last April, Buckley testified that she has had concerns for Tarra’s well-being since her first inspection. Lawyers called on witnesses from wildlife officials to veterinarians to accountants, as well as Buckley, Zeitlin, and Blais, whom the Elephant Sanctuary flew in from South America. The most intense questioning revolved around Tarra’s bond with the sanctuary’s herd.

Tarra’s barn has recently housed Shirley, who was seized by Castro’s forces in Cuba, later survived a shipwreck, and at nearly 72 is one of the oldest Asian elephants in North America; Sissy, another Asian elephant who rejoined the herd in October after more than two years in tuberculosis quarantine; and, according to a sanctuary veterinarian’s testimony in the April trial (a sanctuary spokesperson denies a shared habitat), Nosey, an African elephant who has been at the sanctuary since 2017, though her custody is also currently being disputed.

“Tarra has a beautiful life at the sanctuary,” Blais said later by phone from Brazil. “Shirley adores her, and she adores Shirley.”

But Tarra’s closest companion for years was, in fact, not an elephant at all but a dog: a white stray named Bella, whom she preferred over any of her own species at the sanctuary. Buckley turned their story into a children’s book, which Dolly Parton selected for her book club, sending free copies to children around the world. (Tragically, a pack of coyotes later killed Bella, and Tarra carried her body back to the barn.)

On the third day of the trial, the jury ruled that Buckley did not irrevocably give Tarra to the sanctuary, and Buckley rejoiced quietly, making plans for her transport to Georgia. One month after the verdict was filed, the Elephant Sanctuary filed a motion for a new trial, and it was granted in September. A date has not been set, and Tarra remains in Tennessee.

One day last November, Buckley arrived in Sauraha, Nepal, a tourist town of a few thousand at the gateway for Chitwan National Park. Locals called out to her as she walked along the dusty streets. They emerged from souvenir shops and waved, beckoning to her by name from balconies. She hugged them all. “Namaste,” she said again and again in the customary greeting, smiling, putting her palms together in prayer and conducting quick, excited bows. She asked about their families and in some cases, their elephants, which are sometimes housed just out of view behind the cheap hotels and restaurants that line the streets, which hum with motorbikes, safari Jeeps, and livestock.

Visitors—mostly from Nepal and India and many from China, Germany, and Russia—come to Chitwan, in the grassy lowlands, hoping to spot the endangered one-horned rhinoceros and elusive Bengal tiger, and often, to ride an elephant. Wild elephants roam the surrounding forests, though they are considered mostly seasonal wanderers from nearby northern India. There are around 200 captive elephants in Sauraha, most belonging to hotel owners and others who offer tourist rides, and 60 or so that belong to the government. These government-owned elephants are a crucial part of the anti-poaching brigade, taking park rangers deep into the jungle to head off illegal hunters after horns, skins, and ivory. Buckley knows the creatures by name: Mel Kali, Sundar Mala, Ram Gaj.

In the decade since Buckley was removed from the sanctuary, she has focused on the welfare of captive elephants across Asia, establishing relationships with governments and private companies in Nepal, India, and Thailand. In these countries, captive elephants are used for work and tourist safaris and typically spend resting hours with their ankles shackled to a post, some unable to move more than a few inches.

In Nepal, where she has spent months each year, Buckley established Asia’s first chain-free corrals for working elephants in 2014, allowing more than 80 elephants to roam, graze, play, lie down, and socialize within solar-powered electric fences. This success story was covered by National Geographic, featuring video of elephants being released from chains and trumpeting, flapping their sail-like ears.

Buckley does not believe elephants should live in captivity at all, much less for the purpose of labor or entertainment for humans. But she recognizes that societies don’t change overnight. The initiatives of Elephant Aid International are intended to improve the health and living conditions of working elephants—and educate their owners and caregivers. This often deviates from cultural norms, with mixed success. Her biggest accomplishment in Nepal, she said, was working with the British-owned luxury ecolodge Tiger Tops, on the north side of Chitwan National Park, to release a dozen or so elephants into 18 acres of chain-free corrals. In 2015, the lodge ceased elephant-back safaris for tourists, instead offering jungle walks alongside the giants, where visitors can watch them in their seminatural state. Elephant tourism is big business in Nepal, and this, Tiger Tops and Buckley both attest, is a way to bridge the gap between local livelihoods and responsible tourism.

“Once one does it, they’ll all do it,” she predicted of the tourism industry. Reform has proved to be slow.

On this visit, as she does twice a year in Sauraha, Buckley was conducting a foot-care workshop to trim the elephants’ nails and treat their enormous padded feet for infection. A leading cause of poor health and even death among captive elephants is osteomyelitis of the feet, a bacterial infection of the bone thought to be caused by restricted movement and standing on hard or unclean surfaces.

Although it is the government—or the rich—who own the elephants, it is always the mahouts who care for them. A mahout, the lower-status profession of elephant caregiver, is paired with an elephant for years—or life— living alongside it, typically in a rudimentary hut, feeding it, cleaning its stable, bathing it, training it. Mahouts and their superiors, patchuas and phanets, “drive” the elephants, mounting them from their trunks and straddling their hulking shoulders, directing them by foot and stick as they patrol the forest or carry tourists. No one knows an individual elephant as well as her mahout.

Buckley knows many mahouts by name too—Rupesh, Ajay, Harindra, mostly men; they beamed when she recognized them. With help from a local friend, Shanti, whom she calls “a sister from another lifetime,” she spread the word to mahouts about her workshop, which offered free tools and a small stipend for their time spent away from other duties. And they came, on rickety bikes, on foot, aged 20 to 80, carrying little headshots for their applications, to Shanti’s corner market to sign up.

That first morning in Sauraha, Buckley started off on foot to make the rounds with a gaggle of glommers-on. There was Leslie PonTell Schreiber, a longtime friend from Moorpark College and an Elephant Aid International board member (and former board member at the Elephant Sanctuary), and Becky Dan, a member of the executive council, who was charged with taking photos and video of the activities and registering the mahouts. Other acolytes emerged: An intern from a nearby veterinary school who acted as a translator. Eventually, his entire class joined. Canadian park rangers in town for the annual World Ranger Congress, who heard Buckley speak at the conference over the weekend. A vet originally from Atlanta, who was Buckley’s first intern at the Elephant Sanctuary in 1995, who later moved to Sauraha and acquired an elephant in order to save her. Another from Switzerland, who had done the same—and both were working on initiatives for elephant walks for tourists.

The first stop was the main government-owned hattisar, or elephant house, where Buckley has worked many times before. The open shelters at the edge of the dense jungle house eight elephants, and they all stood in chains in the hazy morning mist, though many of the surrounding electric corrals were working. Buckley figured the fences had become a device for keeping wild bull elephants—as well as tourists—out of the stable. She wasn’t surprised. She knew elsewhere the corrals EAI established from 2013 to 2015 had been washed away during the monsoons and were never repaired. Five years after installation, nearly all of the park elephants were back on chains.

The new official in charge was out. Buckley would have to come back the next day. No amount of arguing or pleading succeeded. As an American woman, she faces an uphill battle with the officials in Nepal, she said, at one point calling out over a whizzing motorbike, “I kiss so much ass here it blows my mind.”

The entourage headed back to Shanti’s shop while Buckley furiously poked at her phone, chatted gaily with Shanti about fashioning a winter blanket for a thin, old elephant, sliced a pomelo for the group, and rounded up motorbikes for a visit to a privately owned hattisar. There, in a yard behind a low-slung jungle hotel, a crowd of mahouts in rubber flip-flops and EAI volunteers gathered for the foot-trimming lesson. “Where’s the clipboard?” she called, sending her aides scrambling. “What is the name of this hatti?” The intern-translator finds out the name of the elephant. “Where’s my sharpener?” Someone ran to get it. “Hold these. Don’t stab anyone with them.”

Buckley gently instructed the mahout to ask his elephant to lie down. He barked commands and the elephant complied, careening to the ground and curling her trunk into her head like a fiddlehead fern. The crowd closed in.

“Okay, everyone, take a step back,” she said. “We have to listen to the mahout. He knows the elephant.” Buckley, fiercely protective of the animal’s space, interacted with the elephants only as much as was necessary to treat their feet. She aches that they must endure the endless stream of unwanted petting, selfies, and rides demanded by tourists.

After documenting each foot by camera, she asked the mahouts to describe what they thought about the condition of her feet. Then she got to work. Like a surgeon, she used metal tools to cut and file the pads of the feet and nails, demonstrating and then passing the tools to the mahouts. She spouted off one-word Nepali instructions, working with the kind of urgency one might expect when dealing with a 7,000-pound creature on its side.

“Rasp.” “Knife.” “Krupa.” “Very good.” “This: Thulo. Too big.” “Beautiful.” Then quietly, to the elephant lying dutifully on the ground: “You’re okay, sweet girl.”

When she was done, the elephant’s mahout led her back to her shelter, where she stepped in and cocked her back foot slightly to allow him to affix her chain.

Buckley’s mission in Georgia isn’t about just one elephant. She is in talks with a number of facilities in hopes of assembling a herd, or two. The elephants will be free to choose their friendships, to form new bonds and families. As with elephant-tourism companies in Nepal, she believes once she has convinced one, the others will follow. She had expected the first arrival to be Mundi, a solitary female African elephant at the now-defunct Dr. Juan A. Rivero Zoo in Puerto Rico. The island’s only zoo lost its license from the USDA in early 2017 and was further hampered by damage from Hurricane Maria later that year. A contract from the Puerto Rican government confirmed the transfer to ERNA, and much of Buckley’s early fundraising was dedicated to the effort, with lines like “Mundi’s yard is finished!” and “Help us finish the barn for Mundi’s arrival” blanketing the organization’s channels. But in December 2018, the Puerto Rican government backed out after a change in leadership. For now, Mundi remains in Puerto Rico, her fate uncertain.

Buckley has learned to say “in theory” a lot. But one thing is certain: She won’t be juggling staffers. She hired a third-generation animal keeper as the lead caregiver, whom Buckley and Blais met in Canada some 30 years ago. He will handle the day-to-day operations, and Buckley can continue her international efforts. Because like the complex creatures she fights for, Buckley needs space to thrive.

0,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors seeking a haven from the economic turmoil created by the coronavirus pandemic are snapping up platinum coins engraved with African wildlife.

Over 2,000 coins featuring an elephant sold out to U.S. and Asian investors after being minted in March, according to Prestige Bullion. More will be produced once South Africa’s virus lockdown is lifted, said Richard Collocott, managing director of the Johannesburg-based company. Additional coins showing the rest of the so-called Big Five animals -- lion, rhinoceros, leopard and buffalo -- will be minted at six-month intervals.

“The platinum bullion coin has performed strongly with good levels of interest from customers, especially in the U.S. and Asia,” Collocott said. “The demand remains high and we expect to take orders once production resumes.”

Prestige Bullion, jointly owned by the South African Reserve Bank and Rand Refinery, is targeting a 20% share of the 100,000-ounce global market for platinum coins. The premium that coin purchasers typically pay above spot prices has widened as demand surged in March and April amid constrained supplies and market turmoil caused by the pandemic, according to Trevor Raymond, director of research at the World Platinum Investment Council.

“The low platinum price in March was a buying opportunity, but the concerns regarding global risk and the huge negative fiscal impact of the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to continue the demand for precious metals, including platinum,” Raymond said.

Communities often comprise a diverse mix of individuals from different districts, towns or cities, considered collectively, especially in the context of social values and responsibilities or a society at large. The built form we offer is a stage for these communities to visit and use, thus foster a sense of belonging through social interactions and communication. Ultimately, it will be a new cultural platform that connects people from different walks of life. Designing a public building allows us to explore ideas to benefit the community in the most efficient way.

The design proposal looks at highlighting the environment that the architecture is nested in, rather than creating architecture that overpowers the surroundings. The project site is located in Lutyens Delhi, at the epicenter of the capital of India. The genesis of the architecture of Lutyens Delhi is based on Indo-Saracenic architecture, this was an amalgamation of traditional Indian architecture along with contemporary architectural styles. The same theme of amalgamating the past and present to create the future has been embedded in the design proposal. Traditional Indian architectural elements, such as a “veranda” and “courtyard” have been integrated with the Hexagon to create contemporary spaces.

0,"This is how the ancient humans may have discovered the elephant's carcass on a lake shore at what is now Schöningen, Germany.

Archaeologists have discovered the nearly complete skeleton of an enormous, now-extinct elephant that lived about 300,000 years ago in what is now the northern German town of Schöningen, according to new research.

Although this elephant — the Eurasian straight-tusked elephant (Palaeoloxodon antiquus) — likely died of old age, meat-eaters promptly devoured it; bite marks on its bones suggest that carnivores feasted on the dead beast, and flint flakes and bone tools found near the elephant indicate that humans scavenged whatever was left, the researchers said.

""The Stone Age hunters probably cut meat, tendons and fat from the carcass,"" project researcher Jordi Serangeli, head of the excavation in Schöningen, said in a statement .

The elephant died on the western side of a vast lake, a hint that it perished from natural causes.

""Elephants often remain near and in water when they are sick or old,"" Ivo Verheijen, a doctoral student in archaeozoology and paleontology at the University of Tübingen, said in the statement. In addition, the elephant, a female, had worn teeth, suggesting it was old when it died, he said.

Researchers have found the remains of at least 10 elephants dating to the Lower Paleolithic — also known as the Old Stone Age (about 3 million to 300,000 years ago) — over the past several years at Schöningen. But this new find is by far the most complete. The remains include 7.5-foot-long (2.3 meters) tusks — which are 125% longer than the average 6-foot-long (1.8 m) tusk of a modern African elephant, according to Encyclopedia Britannica . The researchers also found the complete lower jaw, numerous vertebrae and ribs, large bones from three of its four legs and all five of its delicate hyoid bones, which are found in the neck and help support the tongue and voice box.

This P. antiquus elephant had a shoulder height of about 10.5 feet (3.2 m) and would have weighed about 7.5 tons (6.8 metric tons). ""It was therefore larger than today's African elephant cows,"" Verheijen said.

Near these remains, researchers found 30 small flint flakes and two long bone tools. Micro flakes embedded in these two bones suggests the ancient humans who scavenged the elephant used them to sharpen stone tools (called knapping) at the site, said project researcher Bárbara Rodríguez Álvarez, an archaeologist at the University of Tübingen.

Of note, the ancient humans who likely scavenged the elephant were not Homo sapiens. The earliest evidence of H. sapiens in Europe dates to about 45,000 years ago, according to excavations at a cave in Bulgaria, a study published last week in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution found. Instead, these human scavengers were likely H. heidelbergensis, an extinct human relative who lived about 700,000 to 200,000 years ago, the researchers in Germany said.

Wildlife watering hole

The lake was a popular hole for elephants, according to several of their preserved footprints just 330 feet (100 m) from the new elephant excavation site.

""A small herd of adults and younger animals must have passed through,"" Flavio Altamura, a researcher at the Department of Antiquities at Sapienza University in Rome, said in the statement. ""The heavy animals were walking parallel to the lakeshore. Their feet sank into the mud, leaving behind circular tracks.""

These elephants would have lived in a comfortable climate, comparable to today's; about 300,000 years ago, Europe was in the Reinsdorf interglacial, a warmer period bookended by two glacial (or colder) periods. Other animals thrived there, too. About 20 kinds of large animals lived around the lake, including lions , bears, saber-toothed cats, rhinoceroses , wild horses, deer and large cattle, according to excavations. ""The wealth of wildlife was similar to that of modern Africa,"" Serangeli said.

All of these animals attracted ancient human hunters. Archaeologists have found the remains of 10 wooden spears and one throwing stick from 300,000 years ago, according to a study published online April 20 in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution .

The new finding was uncovered in a collaborative effort between the Senckenberg Centre for Human Evolution and Palaeoenvironment at the University of Tübingen in Germany and the Lower Saxony State Office for Heritage. The research will be published in the magazine ""Archäologie in Deutschland"" (Archaeology in Germany) and was presented at a press conference in Schöningen on May 19.","300,000-year-old remains of towering elephant species discovered in Germany",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS9hbmNpZW50LWVsZXBoYW50LXNjYXZlbmdlZC5odG1s0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZXNjaWVuY2UuY29tL2FtcC9hbmNpZW50LWVsZXBoYW50LXNjYXZlbmdlZC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TQBR4MMSzrgv97xvFonFJ9-1200-80.jpg,2020-05-21,"{'sent': ""This is how the ancient humans may have discovered the elephant's carcass on a lake shore at what is now Schöningen, Germany.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Schöningen'], 'GPE': ['Germany']}}",Elephant

KATHMANDU: Batman was Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor Ahuja’s favourite superhero, and she even went as one to a party.

Revisiting her childhood memories, the Prem Ratan Dhan Payo actress shared a throwback picture of her and Rhea from a party via her Instagram handle.

In the picture, Sonam is seen wearing a black tee-shirt with a Batman logo on it, black denims, Batman cape and socks. And in her neck-length hair, she is seen smiling in the picture.

Meanwhile, her younger sister Reha is also in a black top and black jeans with a denim jacket —she is seen jumping and laughing.

The Veer Di Wedding actress has also shared a long caption along with the photo: “DIY Batman costume for a party that wasn’t fancy dress because he was my favourite super hero. Also jumping and dancing with my ��‍♀️ @rheakapoor is still my favourite thing to do. (Yes those are batman socks and yes I was a nerd).”

Sonam added more details about her costume, in the comments section writing: “Oh the batman logo is a cut out that I stuck on my black t-shirt.”

And as her mother Sunita commented on the post with kiss emojis, Sonam replied to her, “Mom you really let me express myself.”

On the work front Sonam was last seen in The Zoya Factor.

Initiative hopes to share facts to fight COVID-19 Hollywood actors Julia Roberts, Hugh Jackman and Millie Bobby Brown are among the celebrities who will turn over their social media accounts to health experts to share facts and promote a science-driven approach to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.

Roberts, who won an Oscar in 2001 for Erin Brockovich, kicks off the project on May 21 by interviewing Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The #PassTheMic initiative is organised by global nonprofit ONE Campaign which aims to spotlight “health and economic experts … discussing a global response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.” The emphasis is on data, science and facts.

According to ONE, the stars will turn over their social media accounts for one day to frontline workers, health, economic and other experts.

In the interview with Roberts on her personal social media account, Dr Fauci says the main problem to solve is “the extraordinary health disparities” between countries.

“Right now, if you take southern Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, parts of Asia, South America and even parts of the Caribbean as areas that don’t have the healthcare system to be able to respond the way one can respond in New York or L.A. or New Orleans or Chicago, we have really a moral responsibility for people throughout the world,” Dr Fauci said.

Many of the participating celebrities have a big social-media footprint. Roberts, Jackman and Brown have a combined total of about 71 million followers on Instagram alone.

Other celebrities taking part in the campaign include Penelope Cruz, David Oyelowo, Sarah Jessica Parker, Rainn Wilson and Shailene Woodley.

Rajasthan’s Ranthambore tiger reserve has 18 to 35 caracals aka Siyagosh, a secretive wild cat, according to a report by the state’s forest department.

The Indian caracal is an endangered animal and listed as a schedule-I species in the Wildlife Act, 1972. The caracal is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and India. It has a slender build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears and long canine teeth.

The report on status of species by Manoj Parashar, Field Director, Ranthambore Tiger Reserve states that the species earlier was found in drier parts of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kutch but its habitation has now shrunk to parts of Rajasthan (Ranthambore tiger reserve) and Kutch in Gujarat.

Only few records of the species have been reported annually, mainly in the Ranthambore landscape though it was also found in Sariska until recently. The decline in its population and distribution in India is a matter of concern.

Parashar said caracals were tamed and used for hunting in ancient Egypt. In India caracals and cheetahs were tamed and trained for hunting small and large game respectively. In India caracal is known as “Siyagosh”.

“The main threat to the species is the loss of habitat although there have been reports of retaliatory killing of the species by shepherds in Rajasthan as they are known to kill lambs and kids,” Parashar said.

Typically nocturnal, the caracal is highly secretive and difficult to observe. It is territorial, and lives mainly alone or in pairs. The caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals, birds, and rodents. “In Ranthambore tiger reserve seven species of wild cats are found, of which the caracal is the rarest and least known in terms of status and ecology,” states Parashar.

The phase – IV monitoring in Ranthambore was conducted from January to April this year during which some of them were camera trapped.

Parashar said there has been no proper attempt to estimate the abundance of caracals in any area. “It was decided that we will process our camera trap capture data to initiate some population estimation exercise and arrive at an estimate of individuals present in the area. Due to the presence of tigers outside the tiger reserve especially in Dholpur, Karauli and Bundi, camera trap data of these areas could also be included in this exercise,” he said.

Based on the data from all the different camera trap stations, it was concluded that there were at least 18 different individuals and the population could range from 18 to 35 individuals.

The forest department predicts that a sizeable population of caracals could be present in the adjoining forest areas of Karauli, Dholpur and Bundi as well as in the ravines of the National Gharial Sanctuary along the Chambal River.","Ranthambore tiger reserve has 18-35 caracals, says Rajasthan forest dept",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEJJpe-s9r27gtPDCZpUtb1QqFggEKg4IACoGCAoww7k_MMevCDDpywE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/05/21/Pictures/_f692c6ae-9b51-11ea-a010-c71373fc244b.png,2020-05-21,"{'sent': 'india\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['india']}}",Tiger
0,"The endangered red panda is so elusive and enigmatic that science is still not quite certain whether there are one or two different species of this petite, tree-dwelling mammal of the Himalayas, which shares a name (but little else) with that photogenic diva, the giant panda.

The genetic mysteries of the red panda, whose population has been shrinking dramatically, is just one reason why more research is necessary to better understand how this YouTube sensation contributes to the world’s complex biodiversity.

But it’s no mystery to Angela Glatston – whose telling Twitter handle is @RedPandaLady – why the world should care about protecting the red panda and its family pawprint: the chestnut-and-black hued mammal is the only living member of its lineage, the family Ailuridae.

Once lost, it would be lost forever, warns Glatston, a specialist with the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Mathias Appel, Flickr

“It is unique. As the only member of the Ailuridae, it’s one distinct branch of evolution,” explains Glatston, who chairs the Red Panda Network. “If we lose red pandas, it’s like losing all the entire cat family in the world in one fell swoop.”

The red panda’s mysterious genetics are no surprise, given its penchant for privacy. The domestic cat–sized animal sleeps in trees, tightly snuggled into a thick fur blanket created by its bushy tail against the chill mountain air. The clever creature has even evolved fur tufts on its paw pads to protect against the cold and have better grip on mossy tree trunks and branches.

There is little mystery as to the cause of its presence on the IUCN’s list of endangered species: its preferred food – bamboo, which comprises about 98 percent of its diet – is being destroyed by human encroachment on its habitat, bringing deforestation and development. This is one of the largest factors behind a 50 percent drop in the red panda population between 1998 and 2015, says IUCN.

Population estimates now range from as low as 2,500 to no more than 15,000 red pandas remaining in the species’ home range that stretches across parts of Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar and Nepal. Fragmentation of its territory also exposes the red panda to human threats as it forages in search of bamboo.

Dogs and canine distemper, a viral disease that’s fatal for red pandas, are another significant risk as more people, including cattle herders with dogs, move into its shrinking areas of habitat.

The NGO Traffic suggests hunting and poaching are other significant threats to red pandas and, like IUCN, has urged greater research in order to preserve the species. Bhutan, India, Nepal and Myanmar are beginning to act to protect the red panda, says Glatston. “So there is an improvement… but not as much as I would like.”

In China, red panda numbers dropped by as much as 40 percent in the second half of the last century because of massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching, leaving an estimated 3,000 to 7,000 red pandas in China as of 1999.

Still, China could lead new conservation efforts, based on recent studies that buttress the argument for two separate species: the Chinese red panda (Ailurus styani) and the Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens).

If Chinese authorities become seized with the idea of a Red Panda species of their own, they may become much more interested in protecting what is now considered a “secondary” species, behind, of course, the giant panda, says Glatston.

Besides, she points out, the red panda was the first to hold its name, being dubbed “panda” about 50 years before the scene-stealing giant panda – which is actually a bear.","Before the giant panda, there was the red panda",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5nbG9iYWxsYW5kc2NhcGVzZm9ydW0ub3JnLzQ0NTQ4L2JlZm9yZS10aGUtZ2lhbnQtcGFuZGEtdGhlcmUtd2FzLXRoZS1yZWQtcGFuZGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i1.wp.com/news.globallandscapesforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Red-panda-banner-3.jpg?fit=1366%2C692&ssl=1,2020-05-21,"{'sent': 'The endangered red panda is so elusive and enigmatic that science is still not quite certain whether there are one or two different species of this petite, tree-dwelling mammal of the Himalayas, which shares a name (but little else) with that photogenic diva, the giant panda.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two', 'one'], 'ORG': ['Himalayas']}}",Giant White Panda
0,"Endangered Amur tiger cubs, Rusty and Yuki, are thriving during lockdown at Longleat Safari Park.

The 11-month-old brother and sister are the first to have been born at the Wiltshire wildlife attraction for nearly 20 years and are part of a European captive breeding programme for the subspecies.

Native to the far east of Russia, the Amur tiger is the largest of the big cats and can weigh up to 300 kg and measure more than three metres in length.

“Despite the unusual circumstances with no visitors to keep them entertained, Rusty and Yuki are doing great,” said keeper Caleb Hall.

“They have got significantly bigger over the past few months and have grown in confidence as much as they have in stature. They are much more independent of mum Yana, loving to explore and playfight a lot on their own.

“With the better weather they have also started to enjoy the pond, loving to take a dip most days, never at the same time though.

“If one cub is in the pond the other wants to stop them from coming out and trying to push them back into the water.

“Rusty and Yuki are very close though and are always wanting to know what the other one is up to and generally are always within sight of each other at all times, spending 99% of the day together doing the same things,” he added.

In the 1930s the tigers had nearly gone extinct in the wild due to hunting and logging. At one stage it is thought the population fell as low as just 20–30 animals.

Although they are still under severe threat, their status was officially changed from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007.

Wildlife experts believe the current population of around 540 individuals is the highest for more than a century.

0,"Hey, all you cool cats and kittens! (Sorry.) Now that we’re all still indoors and finished marathoning every episode of Tiger King (including the update) and have gossiped about it with our coworkers over Zoom until even we’re tired of ourselves saying how exactly Carol Baskin killed her husband, we need something else to do.

But are we totally ready to move on from the train wreck that is Tiger King? (No.)

Personally, I think it’s good that the majority of us are collectively consuming this media—it opens our eyes to worlds that we didn’t know existed: The cruel side of “sanctuaries” and how to discern which are truly saving animals and which are exploiting them. The lengths people go to in order to obtain money or status from animals or their parts.

Tiger King is full of animal abuse, and it’s not easy to watch. I didn’t watch it and *enjoy* it, which I believe is the case with a lot of people. I couldn’t look away from all these people arguing about who was doing the better job of keeping these wild exotic (and in many cases, endangered) animals in cages. And I was horrified.

Along those lines, I’ve found myself diving into books following characters trying to better the lives of animals or themselves, whether or not they actually succeed. I’ve chosen these specific books like Tiger King for their similarities to discussions of animals in captivity and the morality surrounding that. Some have characters totally opposite to the people in Tiger King, trying to do their best to actually provide help, and some are eerily close in that there aren’t really any good characters or people in the content, but you will not be able to stop reading. Still others are just downright weird (in a fun way).

I’ll flag each as best I can for all warnings, but please take caution and do additional research if you need. You can also donate to or support an actual nonprofit that truly works to preserve wildlife (hint: it’s none of those parks in Tiger King). Here are eight books like Tiger King that will keep your eyes glued to the page until you’re done.

Nature is Healing While the Humans are in Isolation

Amid this global lockdown, there lies a silver lining: Nature is healing in many ways, and some things just turn out for the better. Here is some good news while we are in isolation :



Gangetic Dolphin Spotted

The famous Gangetic or the South Asian River Dolphin made a comeback in Kolkota ghats after 30 years. The said dolphins were a regular sight in Kolkota ghats thirty years ago but due to industrial pollution, it moved away from the said waters. The lockdown in India reduced the water pollution well enough which prompted the dolphins to return.

Air Pollution in Northern India Dropped

NASA satellites have recorded the lowest aerosol level in Northern India, the lowest in two decades. Cities across India have been observed to drop by 40 to 50 percent in air pollution due to the nationwide quarantine.

China Bans Consumption of Wildlife

The consumption of wild animals in China has been banned following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus which is believed to have been from bats to humans in the Wuhan wet market.

The ban covers hunting, trade, transportation, consumption of all terrestrial wild animals. The ban is a victory for campaigners against wildlife trade but is calling Beijing to include a ban on using wild animals for Chinese medical use.



London to be redesigned to encourage walking and cycling after lockdown

London's city street will be redesigned after the lockdown to encourage more people to walk and use bicycles, the Mayor of London announced.

The London Street space initiatives provide an avenue for commuters to have an alternative to public transport, which will have less capacity after the lockdown as the public is asked to maintain a two-meter distance apart to curb the coronavirus spread.



A drop in Global Carbon Monoxide Emission

Last May 19, a new study published in the journal Nature Climate Change revealed that daily global carbon dioxide emissions dropped by 17 percent compared to 2019 levels.



Carbon emissions to drop by 8%

The drop in demand for energy due to the global lockdown will result in an annual decline in carbon emissions of almost eight percent. According to Dr. Fatih Birol, the International Energy Agency, or IEA, Executive Director, the drop in all major fuels such as coal, oil, and gas is staggering, and only renewable energy is holding up during the ""previously unheard-of slump in electricity use.""

Birol added that it is still premature to determine the long term impact of this but the energy industry that is emerging from this pandemic crisis will be different from before.

“The crocodile park was closed from March 16. We think it will remain closed till June end as part of COVID-19 lockdown. Based on last year’s trend, about 1.20 lakh visitors would have visited the park if the times were normal,” Allwin Jesudasan, Director, told IANS.

According to him, the potential revenue to be lost will be about Rs 80 lakh.

“Our annual budget is about Rs 4.5 crore. Apart from visitor entry fees, other revenue sources are local and foreign donations – donations from overseas zoos,” Jesudasan said.

According to him, all the fund sources have been blocked for the past couple of months owing to COVID-19 lockdown. Even the zoos overseas are under lockdown.

“The donations from local donors have come down drastically as their businesses got hit due to lockdown,” Jesudasan said.

According to him, not only was the revenue lost, once the park reopens the operational costs would go up as the visitors have to be provided with sanitisers and personal protective equipment (PPE) that might have to be bought as part of COVID-19 safety measures.

Some top officials have taken a salary cut but the saving is not enough.

The MCBT has about 55 staff. Apart from the crocodile park here, the MCBT also has the Agumbe Rainforest Research Station in Karnataka and the Gharial Ecology Project, along the Chambal river for which the field station is in Garhaita, Uttar Pradesh, Jesudasan said.

With the funds from traditional sources drying up, Jesudasan said the MCBT, couple of days back, started crowd sourcing of funds.

“Our target is to raise Rs 80 lakh. We have already raised about Rs 10 lakh,” Jesudasan said.

He said a city-based industrialist has promised to donate a sum equivalent to what was raised from crowd sourcing, subject to a maximum of Rs 10 lakh.

Sourcing food for the reptiles was not a problem during the lockdown period as the government had exempted zoos and the animal parks.

The crocodiles are fed with fish, buffalo meat, chicken while other species are also fed according to their needs.

According to Jesudasan, breeding of crocodile juveniles has been reduced.

The juveniles are exchanged with other zoos to get a different species. The park got its Komodo Dragon as a part of an exchange programme.

Thor, which is about 15 ft long, is the longest crocodile in the park.

0,"The illegal wildlife trade is one of the highest value illicit trade sectors globally, threatening both human well-being and biodiversity. A prominent example is ivory poaching, leading to an estimated 30% decline in African elephant populations between 2007 and 2014 and costing African states an estimated US$25 million annually in lost tourism revenues.

Rangers are the foundation of action to combat poaching, a job that is incredibly challenging. A recent survey of 7100 rangers across 28 countries showed 50% lack access to clean water, 34% contracted malaria in the preceding year, only 18% are able to live with their families, and 81% believe their jobs are dangerous.

Globally and daily, hundreds of thousands of wildlife rangers patrol wide areas, encountering all manner of plants, animals and signs of poaching like bushmeat snares or elephant carcasses. The data rangers collect, and their intimate knowledge of the protected areas they patrol, constitute a treasure trove of valuable information that can guide the management of biodiversity.

In our recently published analysis, we collaborated with scientists from the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority to predict hotspots of elephant poaching in the Zambezi Valley. The real champions, however, were the rangers who both collected the data on which our analysis was based and helped us build our statistical models.

Timothy Kuiper (used with permission of each ranger)

The experience underscored for us that statistical models and the knowledge of on-the-ground practitioners are valuable and complementary sources of evidence for biodiversity conservation. Each one alone tells only part of the story.

Elephant poachers target waterholes

Our study area, Chewore Safari Area, is part of the Mana-Sapi-Chewore World Heritage Site in Zimbabwe. Between 2000 and 2017, rangers recorded 201 dead poached elephants in Chewore. We wanted to see whether poaching hotspots existed and if so, which areas of the park were most vulnerable.

To answer this question, you can’t just look at where elephant carcasses are found because not every carcass is detected. Carcasses can only be found, by definition, where rangers have patrolled, which might depend on how difficult the terrain is. We corrected the data set of ranger observations to take these biasing factors into account.

Our main finding was that poaching was most likely near permanent water sources, where elephants could predictably be found by poachers. As one ranger said:

Poachers don’t go where there are no animals. Elephants don’t move very far from water.

It’s perhaps unsurprising that poaching is most likely where target species are most abundant. Similar results have been found for elephant poaching in Tanzania and large animal poaching in Uganda..

By targeting sites of high elephant abundance, poachers are able to maximise success while minimising the time and resources spent in the park, thus reducing the chances of being found by rangers.

Most other spatial predictors (like tree cover and distance to community land) had only weak predictive power. This suggests that poaching is somewhat random across space, making it difficult to know where poachers might target next.

Our results help reveal how poachers operate, and may guide future patrols to deter them. Our predictions are all the more interesting because rangers in our study area already do routinely patrol near waterholes. Yet the data still show that poachers routinely kill elephants in such areas. This may reflect low manpower: rangers can’t be everywhere all the time. Knowing which exact waterhole poachers might target next is a bit of a gamble.

Over and above these immediate results, we believe that the real value of our research lies in what it has taught us about the deep knowledge which rangers have of their areas, the wildlife within them, and how poachers work.

Rangers as scientists: helping build and critique statistical models

We used various statistical bias-correction methods to try and tease apart real poaching patterns from those driven by ranger patrol bias. This is where engaging rangers as participatory modellers was crucial. Before building our models, we individually interviewed several rangers and protected area managers to help us better understand the behaviour of three key agents: poachers, elephants, and the rangers themselves. This helped us select sensible variables to include in our models (like distance to water or to the community lands), and appropriate bias-correction methods.

But the various methods we tested produced model scenarios with quite different results: how were we to know which ones were closest to the truth?

Timothy Kuiper and used with permission of the rangers.

Ranger insights really shone when we re-visited Chewore after running our models and asked rangers to interrogate the results. We conducted two focus groups with 7-8 rangers each, presenting graphs of key model predictions and asking rangers to give us their thoughts.

It emerged after lively discussion that some model scenarios produced results that simply didn’t make sense in light of what the rangers knew. This forced us to reflect on our models and ultimately led us to recognise the poor assumptions we made in one of our bias-correction scenarios.

This also meant that we were more confident with our final predictions.

Going forward

People’s experiences and observations might be subjective, while statistical models might be based on poor assumptions. We advocate combining these diverse sources of insight to produce more reliable knowledge in the face of uncertainty.

More importantly, our work demonstrates the value of meaningfully engaging rangers in conceptualising and tackling conservation problems, rather than seeing them as passive nodes through which conservation strategies are enacted. Our work shows that rangers are far more than the people who take on poachers at the frontline of conservation; they are also ecologists with a deep understanding of the areas they patrol.",Statistical models and ranger insights help identify patterns in elephant poaching,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9zdGF0aXN0aWNhbC1tb2RlbHMtYW5kLXJhbmdlci1pbnNpZ2h0cy1oZWxwLWlkZW50aWZ5LXBhdHRlcm5zLWluLWVsZXBoYW50LXBvYWNoaW5nLTEzNzgzNNIBeWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9hbXAvc3RhdGlzdGljYWwtbW9kZWxzLWFuZC1yYW5nZXItaW5zaWdodHMtaGVscC1pZGVudGlmeS1wYXR0ZXJucy1pbi1lbGVwaGFudC1wb2FjaGluZy0xMzc4MzQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images.theconversation.com/files/335727/original/file-20200518-83357-87ducs.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2020-05-25,"{'sent': 'A prominent example is ivory poaching, leading to an estimated 30% decline in African elephant populations between 2007 and 2014 and costing African states an estimated US$25 million annually in lost tourism revenues.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['an estimated US$25 million']}}",Elephant

Hyderabad: A lone tiger looking for territory has forced mining companies and forest department officials to work together -- a rather rare occurrence -- in Adilabad district of Telangana.

A three-year-old male tiger from Maharashtra, most likely in search of territory, was spotted several times near the Khairaguru open cast coal mine. The forest department communicated with the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), which owns the mine, to ensure no harm comes to the tiger.

The company embraced the challenge of having a tiger around its mines and even stopped some of its night operations in the past three weeks or so to ensure the tiger gets some peace and room to go on its way.

“We are actually delighted to have a tiger on our land. For us this is a validation of our afforestation activities on overburden deposits (soil, rock etc that lies above a coal seam or ore body) on which we have grown tens of thousands of trees. These overburden ‘hills’ are now like proper forests and we are happy that a tiger believes it can move around in this area,” a senior SCCL official told Deccan Chronicle.

According to Kawal tiger reserve field director C.P. Vinod Kumar, it is very likely that the tiger is attempting to cross the mining area and move towards the reserve. “We asked SCCL officials to help us keep the animal safe. They responded positively and are taking steps based on our advice to keep the tiger safe,” Kumar said.

The presence of the tiger came to light from videos shot by SCCL workers and posted on social media sites. Forest officials though have been tracking the tiger since the beginning of this month when it entered the state. “Three teams of foresters are working in shifts round the clock and keeping track of the tiger. We hope it will find its way to the forests near Kawal soon,” Kumar said.

Following a request from the forest department, SCCL has urged its staff not to film the tiger if they come across it. “We also advised them not to share any pictures of the animal anymore. We also suspended some night operations when asked to do so to allow the tiger to move freely near the mines,” an SSCL official said.

SCCL has also put the brakes on its huge dumper trucks with capacities ranging from 35 to 60 tonnes each, to prevent a possible accident.

“The forest officials requested that we cut down speeds. Since we cannot put speed breakers on the roads, we came up with a different solution,” the SCCL official said. A number of 200 litre metal drums were rolled out and set up asy barricades on the roads that run in and out of the mines to slow down the trucks.

“It is not just us officials. Even our staff is delighted to have a tiger amidst us. They are very excited but are also being careful as we are cautioning them regularly that though it is a fascinating animal, if it is disturbed, it may turn on people. We do not want a conflict situation and we too hope that it will safely move to a forest area,” the SCCL official said.

0,"Tiger Woods made 1 sneaky club tweak that you likely missed

Tiger Woods and his famed Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS. Getty Images

Tiger Woods rarely (if ever) goes out of his way to point out changes to his equipment setup. Some changes are a little bit easier to notice — like changing drivers or irons — while others fly completely under the radar until they’re eventually unearthed. Woods’ gear setup is a real-life version of “Where’s Waldo.” You never know when you’re going to find a fresh tweak.

The latest adjustment is a perfect example. With three months in between starts — if you can call last weekend’s Match II win over Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady a “start” — Woods took the downtime to get his famed Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS putter checked out by Cameron before the Match II.

Due to the sheer number of putts Woods hits on a regular basis, he wanted the loft and lie checked to confirm nothing had changed. With the putter already in Cameron’s shop, Woods also had the iconic “cherry bomb” in the cavity refilled with red paint.

For those unfamiliar with the red dot, it’s part of what makes Tiger’s putter “The Scotty.” Located in the cavity and heel of the putter, the dot was popularized by Woods, who started using a Newport 2 GSS in 1999 at the then-GTE Byron Nelson Classic.

As the story goes, prior to shipping the putter for Woods to test, Cameron noticed the head weight was too heavy by two swing-weight points, which led him to mill a dot in the back cavity and another in the heel of the face to get the preferred weight. Red paint was then applied to give it a striking look. The cherry bomb is not only found on Woods’ putter but countless retail products from Cameron.

Woods’ red dot had been missing from the cavity since the 2019 Open Championship when he concealed it behind multiple strips of lead tape to handle the slow greens at Royal Portrush. When Woods went to remove the tape after the event, it took the red paint with it, leaving the 15-time major winner with a putter that no longer featured its signature calling card.

Woods is still Superman with or without the cape, but the return of the cherry bomb to his famed putter was a welcomed sight at Medalist. Does it provide any performance benefit? Of course not. Then again, we’re talking about arguably the most important club in the history of professional golf.

india

Updated: May 26, 2020 16:20 IST

The number of tigers in Rajasthan’s Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) has gone up to 20 with the birth of three cubs recently.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot took to Twitter to hail the good news.

“Amid Corona concern, tigress ST-12 gives good news. Three new cubs have been camera trapped in Sariska Tiger Reserve. Now there are 20 tigers in year 2020 in #Sariska. My wish is to see the wild life thrives in state,” he tweeted.

In March 2020, after a two year wait, Sariska tigress ST-10 and her cub was spotted in the Talvriksh range. STR now has 20 big cats, of which 11 are female, 5 male and rest cubs.

STR Field Director, Ghanshyam Prasad Sharma, said this is the second litter of three cubs of 6-year-old ST-12 – the cubs are three months old. In 2018, she had given birth to three cubs which dispersed after they became adults.

“This year has been good for the Reserve as five tigers – three cubs of ST-12 and two of ST-14 became adults while four cubs have been born,” said Sharma.

He also said that after a long time, two tigers ST-18 (son of ST-14) and ST-19 (daughter of ST-12) have started moving in the buffer zone.

Former Indian Forest Service officer and president of Sariska Tiger Foundation, Sunayan Sharma welcomed the news of the new cubs.

“STR is certainly a potential habitat and can support a good number of big cat population. The current number of 20 can increase up to 35 but for that we need to reduce grazing in and outside the Reserve,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Ranthambore Tiger Reserve is also expecting cubs from three tigresses, which have not been seen in the last 2-3 months. “Tigresses T-19, 102 and 92 either have or would be giving birth to cubs.

0,"Two white Bengal tigers have arrived at Bulgaria’s Sofia Zoo from Győr in Hungary. The cubs are brother and sister, one year and seven months old respectively, and are very rare in the wild.

Sofia Zoo has been closed for the last two months due to coronavirus but recently reopened, welcoming visitors who want to catch a glimpse of its newest residents.

Despite being such young cubs, the white tigers, named Kiafa and Narcissus are already nearly full sized. They both weigh around 150 kg but Kiafa, the male, could reach up to 200 kg as an adult. The siblings have a lot in common, with light brown stripes and piercing blue eyes. But the female is observed as being more “timid and mistrustful”, while the male is “braver and more socialized”, according to the conservation team at Sofia Zoo.

The white tiger is simply a pigmentation variant of the Bengal tiger and is very rare in the wild. The species find it “difficult to survive in natural conditions due to their atypical color, which makes them easily noticeable and prevents them from hunting,” says the zoo.

Tiger conservation, from protecting habitats to zoo breeding programmes, is recognised by organisations like the WWF to be the best way to protect the species from dying out. At Sofia Zoo, they are safe and well fed. “It’s so easy to feed them, they like the food we are offering them,” chief keeper Radko Sertov told Reuters. “They eat meat, mainly chicken, beef or horse meat. They also eat some fish once a week.”

The pair will live somewhere between 10 and 25 years if properly cared for.

Tigers are an endangered species

Tigers are listed as ‘Endangered’ on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, with the Bengal tiger listed as particularly vulnerable.

A century ago, there were as many as 100,000 wild tigers living in Asia. Today, fewer than 3,900 are left, according to the UN’s World Wildlife Day fact-sheet. Not only are wild tigers hunted to meet the demands of the $20 billion a year illegal wildlife market, they are killed by villagers to protect livestock and communities.

Bengal tigers tend to live in tropical and subtropical forests in countries like India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Their habitats are increasingly under threat due to agricultural developments, namely palm oil plantations which result in deforestation.

A Tiger Summit was held in St Petersburg, Russia, in November 2010. There, the 13 tiger range countries (including Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Russia, India, Thailand and Laos) made commitments to launch a Global Tiger Recovery Program. The aim was to double the number of wild tigers by 2022.

The goals involved engaging with indigenous and local communities, eradicating poaching, smuggling and illegal trade, and preserving tiger habitats.

According to the UN, the future of tiger ranges depends upon the Asian governments “creating effective tiger landscapes by conserving large areas of suitable habitat.”","White tiger cubs, brother and sister, greet visitors at Bulgarian zoo",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEOE2dSHcqU8_J0cClyXUhcYqGAgEKg8IACoHCAow-ZzLBzD77Ecw-bS4Bg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/70/52/02/1000x563_cmsv2_49a3f08d-5c8e-5c15-92bb-b9e064b07b60-4705202.jpg,2020-05-26,"{'sent': 'Two white Bengal tigers have arrived at Bulgaria’s Sofia Zoo from Győr in Hungary.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two'], 'PERSON': ['Bengal'], 'GPE': ['Bulgaria', 'Hungary', 'Győr'], 'ORG': ['Sofia Zoo']}}",Tiger

0,"The Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve in Sichuan province hosts over 3,700 species of flora and fauna. And forests cover 96 percent of its roughly 40,000 hectares. [Photo provided to China Daily]

CHENGDU－Birds sing in chorus to announce morning's arrival in the Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve in Southwest China's Sichuan province.

The reserve takes its name from the small Tangjia River, which snakes through the reserve and flows into a tributary of the Yangtze, China's longest river.

It hosts over 3,700 species of flora and fauna. And forests cover 96 percent of its roughly 40,000 hectares.

But the area was desolate wasteland years ago.

Tangjiahe's transformation has come to the spotlight as China observes the International Day for Biological Diversity on Friday.

Historically, people living in the area depended on the mountains to make a living.

They hunted animals and logged trees. A logging operation was established there in 1965.

Over 1,000 workers cut down almost 30,000 cubic meters of wood a year to support the country's construction work.

But the logging and poaching devastated Tangjiahe's ecosystem.

""The animals just ran way,"" says Pu Youhai, an elderly resident who used to hunt in the wilderness.

""At that time, you had to go to places that were very high and very far to find game.""

But that changed in 1975, when local officials decided that the situation needed to be addressed and applied to designate the area as a nature reserve to conserve its rare wildlife.

The reserve's construction was completed three years later, and logging ceased.

In 1983, it built an observation station for giant pandas, making it the second of its kind at that time.

Many seasoned experts came to Tangjiahe to track, monitor and research pandas, which provided valuable data to advance the protection of the animals and their habitats.

In 1985, hundreds of villagers from the heartland were relocated to make space for rare plants and animals, such as pandas.

Since Tangjiahe's wild pandas live in groups, China had included the reserve in its pilot national giant panda park that broke ground in 2016. It hosts 39 wild pandas, a national survey says.

Ma Wenhu has been patrolling the reserve for over 20 years.

Many animals under state protection have returned to Tangjiahe, including Chinese monal pheasants, golden pheasants and blood pheasants, the 51-year-old says.

""I can distinguish among the sounds of more than 100 types of birds,"" he says.

Ma always takes a camera on patrol.

In 2014, he captured the image of a wild otter, which is under second-class state protection. It was the first time that a wild otter was caught on camera in the country since 2000.

That year, Tangjiahe was included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas. The reserve furthered protection by compiling a textbook about the environment and built seven natural science museums. About 5,000 students from middle and primary schools visited Tangjiahe last year.

Green development has allowed locals to live in harmony with the environment.

Local authorities have pooled funds to help build rural cooperatives in such sectors as beekeeping and fruit cultivation.

""I've raised scores of beehives,"" says villager Yang Tingxiu.

""We can make up to 70,000 yuan ($9,822) more every year thanks to the apiaries.""

The 54-year-old also runs a family inn. The household can earn more than 100,000 yuan a year.

In Yinping village, a few kilometers from the reserve, more than 100 family inns have sprung up, offering local delicacies and accommodation.

""Almost every household has entered the family-inn business,"" says village official Luo Chengpeng.

Deng Xiaofeng opened the village's first family inn 14 years ago.

She has 32 guestrooms after expanding. Last year, her business brought in over 200,000 yuan.

And our lives are getting better,"" she says.",A wasteland's revival as a wildlife refuge,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHA6Ly9nbG9iYWwuY2hpbmFkYWlseS5jb20uY24vYS8yMDIwMDUvMjYvV1M1ZWNjNjIxMGEzMTBhOGIyNDExNTg2MTQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202005/26/5ecc6210a310a8b2fa4ae278.png,2020-05-26,"{'sent': 'The Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve in Sichuan province hosts over 3,700 species of flora and fauna.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve'], 'GPE': ['Sichuan province'], 'CARDINAL': ['over 3,700']}}",Giant White Panda

KATHMANDU: An all-party meeting under the convenorship of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was held today at the PM’s official residence in Baluwatar.

According to Prime Minister Oli’s Press Advisor, Surya Thapa, the all-party meeting has concluded after nearly three hours of discussion, wherein various issues, including country’s geographical boundary were discussed.

Prime Minister, in the meeting, stressed the need for all parties to move forward with unconditional agreement on the geographical integrity, border issues, and nationality, stated Thapa. “Dialogue and diplomacy are the only solutions to solve the present issues pertaining to the boundary disputes.”

He further informed that PM Oli drew the attention of participating leaders on the need to make swift decision regarding the change in image of Nepal’s map on the coat-of-arms and further discuss other outstanding issues on constitution amendment.

An amendment of Schedule 3 of the Constitution is required as a step forward in this matter. The issuance of a new political map of Nepal incorporating Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani calls for the image of the map on the coat-of-arms to be corrected.

Around one-third of the world’s mangrove delta – the Sunderban --- has been damaged by Cyclone Amphan, according to a preliminary assessment of the West Bengal forest department. However, there is no confirmation of deaths of tigers or other animals in the delta, officials said.

“Around 1500 sq km of forest area has suffered massive damage in the cyclone. The nylon net fencing that was set up to prevent tigers from straying into villages has also been damaged. There are no reports of any animals killed so far in the storm,” said Ravi Kant Sinha, chief wildlife warden of West Bengal.

The Sunderban delta comprises 102 islands of which 54 have human settlements while the rest have forests. It has around 4200 sq km of forests crisscrossed by rivers and creeks. This is the only mangrove in the world where tigers live. There are around 100 tigers in the Indian part of the Sunderban.

“We have surveyed almost 70% of the forest area using mechanized boats. Two drones were also used to assess the damage. Extensive areas of mangrove forests have been damaged. But we haven’t found any carcasses of animals yet. We didn’t even see birds circling above any particular area of the forest which could have hinted that there could be a carcass,” said S Kulandivel, joint director of Sunderban Biosphere Reserve.

Located at the southern tip of Bengal at the mouth of the sea, the dense mangrove is known to protect human settlements including the city of Kolkata, acting as a shield against cyclones.

“The mangroves do not just help to reduce the wind speed drastically when the storm moves through the delta but even helps to break the waves and the storm surge triggered,” Sugata Hazra, professor at School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University said.

It had saved Kolkata from the wrath of Cyclone Aila in 2009 and from Cyclone Bulbul in 2019. But this time the mangrove forest has suffered the most, a forest department official, said after preliminary stock taking. A detailed survey is still going on, he said.

Between 2017 and 2019 the delta had already lost nearly two percent mangrove cover, according to the state of forest report 2019. The FSI report also said that since 2011 the very dense mangrove cover, which comprise pristine and thick mangrove forests, has come down from 1038 sq km to 996 sq km in 2019.

“As incidents of tiger straying was a major problem in the Sunderbans, nylon net fencing has been put up along the forest boundary surrounding the fringe villages. But out of the 211 km of fencing around 100 has been ripped apart by the storm,” said Sinha.

The Forest Department has already repaired the fencing along 60 km which was in ‘most trouble-some’ areas such as Kultali, Ajmalmari, Uttar Gurguria and Dakshin Gurguria. These areas had witnessed the maximum cases of tigers straying in the past.

Even though there have been no reports of animal deaths after the storm and no carcasses have been found, former top forest officials have warned that tiger straying could increase in the coming months.

“After Cyclone Aila wild boars could not be found as they could not bear the 4-6 hours of water inundation and died and were swept away. We could not find their carcass. Large animals like tiger and deer survived. But due to shortage of pray (as wild boars were small in number) tiger straying (human- tiger conflict) started. It was a nightmare for forest staff and villagers. I fear that,” PK Vyas, former chief wildlife warden of West Bengal said.","Cyclone Amphan destroys one-third of world’s largest mangrove delta, tiger habitat",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEAyBmUkVJg9Q9dof8k2N0lIqFggEKg4IACoGCAoww7k_MMevCDDpywE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/05/27/Pictures/sundari-sunderbans-mangrove-consisting-stream-flowing-jungle_0684437a-a01c-11ea-95c6-464eb77020f3.jpg,2020-05-27,"{'sent': 'india\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['india']}}",Tiger

When you hear about a crocodile, the first image that comes to your mind is that of a huge scary reptile, with vivacious eyes and scary teeth, basking in the sun or just waiting in the water. But have you ever heard of a croc that has taken a whiff of wanderlust and travelled far from the place it was supposed to be in? Turns out, a Gharial in Nepal did that and this odd story has now piqued netizens’ interest.

Shared on Twitter by Wildlife Trust India, the post shows the picture of the said Gharial. According to a blog link shared by the trust in the post’s caption, this fish-eating crocodile falls under the critically endangered species and was released into the wild in Nepal, only to be found 1100 km away in Hooghly, India. The croc apparently travelled for 61 days to reach Hooghly.

The picture also shows the scute markings on the croc’s tail that helped biologists identify it.

Read the detailed story here:

Posted on May 25, the croc’s voyage garnered some curious comments from netizens. While some were astonished, others wanted to know if the Gharial’s trip is still on.

“It’s amazing,” writes a Twitter user. “Is it marking territory or claiming what’s rightfully theirs?” asks another. “What is the current status of this Gharial?” enquires the third.

However, this reptile is not the first one to manage to achieve this feat. In 2015, another Gharial was said to cover a distance of 1000 km in 234 days.

The forest habitat they rely on has also suffered steep declines in recent years, with one 2018 study concluding that at current rates of deforestation, all of the primary forest in the Congo Basin could be cleared by the end of the century. As Mongabay’s contributing editor for Africa, Terna Gyuse, tells us, the chief threats to the Congo Basin’s rainforests are human activities.

On today’s episode of the Mongabay Newscast we take a look at a project that aims to preserve the rainforests of the Congo Basin in Central Africa and the biodiversity found in those forests by focusing on elephants and their calls.

Listen here:

The Elephant Listening Project is based out of Cornell University in the United States, but its field work is conducted in the Central African Republic and the Republic of Congo. As a research analyst with the project, Ana Verahrami has completed two field seasons in the Central African Republic, where she helped collect the behavioral and acoustic data vital to the project.

Verahrami joins the Mongabay Newscast to explain why forest elephants’ role as keystone species makes their survival crucial to the wellbeing of tropical forests and their other inhabitants. We listen to a handful of the recordings the Elephant Listening Project has made at Dzanga Bai in the Central African Republic to better understand elephant communication, as well as recordings from its landscape-scale acoustic grid in the Republic of Congo’s Nouabalé-Ndoki National Park.

It is believed that, in the early 20th century, there were as many as 3 to 5 million African elephants. Today, there are just around 400,000 African elephants left.

One of the two existing African elephant species, forest elephants are native to the humid forests of West Africa and the Congo Basin. The forest habitat they rely on has also suffered steep declines in recent years, with one 2018 study concluding that at current rates of deforestation, all of the primary forest in the Congo Basin could be cleared by the end of the century. As Mongabay’s contributing editor for Africa, Terna Gyuse, tells us, the chief threats to the Congo Basin’s rainforests are human activities.

Verahrami says that what the project is learning about elephant communication can help to improve protections for elephant populations: “That would give us a lot more detail on the population demography, the makeup of the group of elephants in that region, and also help us to better protect them. Is there a specific spot in the forest that they’re going to mate, for example? That’s somewhere we’d really, really, really want to make sure we’re protecting so the population can continue to grow.” Protecting elephant populations, Verahrami adds, will in turn benefit the tropical forest ecosystem as a whole.

The Elephant Listening Project is part of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. We’ve featured the work of several researchers affiliated with the lab in the past, here’s a few more examples:

Waller, a native of Kalispell, is one of six UM students to receive a Fulbright Scholarship this year. The recipients continue UM’s legacy of securing Fulbright Scholarships, said Clint Walker, the UM Fulbright adviser and an associate professor of Russian.

“We had a 50% success rate this year,” Walker said. “This percentage is well above the national average and speaks to the high quality of our UM applicants for Fulbrights.”

The Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers opportunities for students and young professionals to undertake international graduate study, advanced research, university teaching and primary and secondary school teaching worldwide.

Waller will conduct research in the Russian Far East, testing new ways to monitor prey species of Amur (Siberian) tigers to foster tiger conservation.

“Specifically, I’m comparing new methods for estimating prey population size using camera traps, developed recently here at UM by my fellow graduate student Anna Moeller, with traditional Russian snow tracking techniques,” Waller said.

Because of COVID-19, the Fulbright program has been postponed until later this year or January 2021, but when Waller does go overseas, he will be based in a small village called Terney on the coast of the Sea of Japan.

“The village is surrounded by the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, a stronghold for the Amur tiger population,” Waller said. “Russian scientists have conducted research there on Amur tiger ecology since the reserve’s formation in 1935 and have worked closely with the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Russia Program during the last quarter-century to protect this flagship species.”

Waller, whose parents are both alumni of UM’s Wildlife Biology program, said he wants to continue working as a wildlife biologist in international conservation.

“The global community needs to work together to solve our global conservation problems, even when the political situation is tense,” he said. “The relationship between the Sikhote-Alin Reserve and Wildlife Conservation Society is a great example of this, and I’m lucky to be able to work with and learn from them.”

Debbie Banks, who has spent more than two decades trying to crack down on big cat crime with the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), believes Carole Baskin and her sanctuary’s goals were pure. She claimed that Joe Exotic’s was not as noble as he claimed because his tiger breeding efforts had “nothing to do with conservation” and were solely for profit. The EIA investigator believes they should not be kept in caged facilities because it turns them into “tiger-shaped animals” that possess “none of the qualities of wild tigers”. Ms Banks told Express.co.uk: “It’s all about profit, breeding in these facilities has no other reason than to have cubs for visitors to play with.

“Breeding tigers in the US has zero conservation, unless they are part of international stud books. “It’s absolute nonsense, the tragedy is the number of people in the US who have been fooled by the idea that these facilities contribute to conservation.” Ms Banks claimed that the decision to breed white tiger cubs highlighted Joe Exotic’s commitment to profit rather than helping to increase population sizes.

Sonoco Reels & Plugs has marked another milestone in its quest to enhance manufacturing workforce development by employing and training students eager to launch rewarding careers.

The company recently celebrated seven high school seniors who excelled in the Tiger Launch program as they “signed on” for full-time positions at Sonoco.

The 2020 Tiger Launch Graduation Signing Ceremony was held May 12 at Sonoco’s Tiger Launch facility in Hartselle.

Tiger Launch is an apprenticeship-style program begun fall 2018 in partnership with Hartselle City Schools. The eight-student program grew to 24 students in fall 2019 and is expected to welcome about 40 for the coming school year.

The 2020 graduates who have accepted post-graduation positions at Sonoco are Briten Barclay, Wesley Long, Weston Philpot, Caleb Puckett, Thomas Prus, Levi Rice and Daniel Sandlin. The signing ceremony made their continued employment at Sonoco official as they take on new, full-time roles and begin mentoring others.

Sonoco leaders, including plant managers Matt Williams and Todd Whatley, superintendent Doug Ainsworth and Tiger Launch manager Richard Long, gathered with the seven graduates for the ceremony. They were joined by HCS Superintendent Dr. Dee Dee Jones, who serves as Tiger Launch program manager, as well as Jeff Hyche, a career tech instructional planner and former principal of Hartselle High.

Ten other seniors who participated in the program this year are taking what they learned at Sonoco with them to college and other opportunities.

During half days at school and half days at Sonoco, the largest industrial employer in Hartselle, Tiger Launch students completed coursework while getting hands-on manufacturing experience in producing reels, spools and other industrial products.

The program was modeled after “12 for Life,” an initiative started by Southwire, one of Sonoco Reels & Plugs’ biggest customers, more than a decade ago in Florence.

“Through Tiger Launch, students get a chance to learn the discipline it takes to really be successful in the workplace. At the same time, we gain an opportunity to understand our incoming workforce and how we can apply our learning to facility processes and improvements,” Williams said.

“When the program started, the unemployment rate in our area was very low,” Long added. “Tiger Launch allowed us to pick out ‘the cream of the crop’ and give kids a great opportunity to make a contribution to Sonoco and the community we work in. Originally, all the students came from Hartselle High School. Now Morgan County has joined us with kids from both Danville and Brewer high schools. For the upcoming school year, we also plan to welcome Falkville and Priceville High School students.”

Long said the growth and success of Tiger Launch has depended greatly on Sonoco management’s dedication to the program.

“Without their willingness to be all in, it never would have worked,” Long said. “You have to believe that if you do the right thing for students and the community, the break–even point and financial benefits will come.

“Giving students resume experience and the opportunity to learn work skills is great for them and for the company, whether they stay with Sonoco or not.”

One student, Courtney Shaddrix, was considering becoming a pediatric nurse, but she jumped at the chance to get the workplace experience Tiger Launch offered.

“I found I really liked building fiber drum reels, doing reel hardware kitting, working with my hands and learning about the business aspects of a company from the inside out,” she said. “Not only did I get to know what a real-world working experience is like, I was also able to build relationships with people who will be friends and supporters for life.”

Now, a year after she graduated from the program, Shaddrix is line lead and a guiding force in Sonoco’s Tiger Launch facility. “This has been a really eye-opening experience for me and a lot of other students,” Shaddrix said, “and we really appreciate everything it has done for us.”

“I felt so bad for graduating seniors this year with everything that has happened. We were more excited than ever to be able to reward them for the opportunity they have created for themselves through hard work at Sonoco,” Long said. “Going forward, we can’t wait to develop more workplace relationships with the younger people we need to continue our company’s lasting legacy of success in north Alabama.”

What’s Next for Tiger Launch Grads?

0,"LETTER | The plight of human life facing the scourge of Covid-19 has garnered global attention as the international community assesses the cost of human lives lost, the outlay for healthcare, economic losses, social upheaval and political instability that has occurred and will continue in the foreseeable future.

The fate of wildlife worldwide is no better as they suffer from habitat loss, poaching, disease, natural disasters, floods, fire, and drought. The 21st century saw the extinction of various species and this is the century that will decide whether Man can co-exist with wildlife on a win-win formula. 20 years of this century have gone by and there is not much improvement for wildlife globally. The remaining decades will prove whether Planet Earth will be called home by both Man and wildlife, or by Man alone. Covid-19 has given a new impetus to balance development and nature for holistic progress.

For mankind, a vaccine is being rushed through but wildlife are left to fend for themselves to counter the onslaught of Man against their natural habitat. Zoonotic diseases helped to protect wildlife but they are losing their sting as vaccines overcome them enabling people to continue preying on endangered wildlife. Zoonotic diseases are not the only problem as some diseases transmitted among humans are equally as deadly as was the case when European explorers to the New World (the Americas) passed on diseases that wiped out large populations of natives who had no immunity. The Covid-19 lockdown has given a flashback of the world decades ago. One could see pictures of leopards, elephants, civet cats, deer, and even lions entering villages and residential areas in many part parts of the world taking advantage of the lull in human activities during the lockdown, and possibly wanting to reclaim their lost habitat!

Global warming and climate change are adding to the woes of wildlife, which unlike Man, cannot easily adapt to changing conditions. The recent great Australian fire caused great destruction to wildlife and reportedly more than a billion creatures- big, small, and tiny – perished in the flames. The Earth’s temperature is going up by 1-2 degrees but many are denying it, and wildlife from polar bears to penguins are threatened. Doesn’t the smoke and heat resulting from a wide range of socio-economic activities cause a dent in the ozone layer? Can anyone think of an activity that cools the earth? The answer is an emphatic ‘none!’ Having endangered wildlife, how long can Man prevent the danger to himself? Nowadays, environmental degradation, pollution, and natural disasters are taking a heavy toll on nations, and billions of dollars have to be spent on repairs and rehabilitation, and some nations and politicians continue to be in denial mode about climate change despite nations being buffeted by a series of natural calamities.

Covid-19 could threaten wildlife even more than before as travel and tourism are devastated. Many wildlife sanctuaries have been funded and protected with tourism revenue and communities around the parks and reserves are sustained by this arrangement. When tourism declines, poaching and trafficking may increase, jeopardizing wildlife. Tourism has been affected much and the tourist dollar that supports conservation and wildlife habitats will dry up and open prospects for poaching and trafficking to overcome poverty and unemployment. Even with tourist revenues, there was the ever-present risk of poaching of endangered wildlife. According to Charles Darwin the success of any species depended on natural selection but presently it depends on human selection – which animals can be saved by conservationists and which will face extinction at the hands of poachers.

The time has come for Man to actively help wildlife escape extinction. India and China, despite their huge populations, are finding success in supporting and conservation of wildlife. In India the tiger, Gir Lions, Rhino, Gaur, elephants, and leopards continue to thrive and China too has found success with the rehabilitation of the Siberian tiger, various pandas, the Tibetan antelope, and many other animals. There are also successful rehabilitation efforts in the Americas, Europe, Russia, and Australia. A major concern is with sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia which are volatile and risky for a wide range of wildlife brought by poaching, trafficking of wild animal parts, and agriculture. The Amazon, the Congo, Borneo, and New Guinea regions are at risk of agriculture and timber exploitation as these areas are not only huge but are well known for their bio-diversity.

It has now come to a stage where wildlife needs the active assistance of Man to prevent extinction, and various methods are implemented – research, culling, re-location, tagging of wild animals, patrolling of parks to prevent poaching, educating people near wildlife sanctuaries on the need to protect wildlife and eco-tourism benefits. In this regard, trophy hunting of large wildlife like lions, elephants, antelopes, deer, and buffaloes should be stopped in the Southern African countries. The largest and strongest of these animals symbolize the best of the species genetically and should be preserved, not killed for trophy hunting mainly by Western big game hunters. The episode of Cecil, the Kenyan lion, killed by a trophy hunter created much criticism and controversy, and this opportunity should have been used to ban trophy hunting outright, especially of endangered animals. Many of these species, male and female, need to be genetically strong to breed offspring that can survive in the wild in a fast-changing physical habitat. Many countries allow this practice as the hunters pay a high price for permits. These hunters could be persuaded to use tranquilisers instead of bullets to bring down their targets and after having satisfied their egos with a few photos of the downed animal, they can give an antidote to revive the animal. This is very much better than killing the animal.

Eco-tourists can also play a part as a pressure group forcing governments to act on wildlife conservation as they bring in tourism revenue to some cash-strapped African countries. They should oppose trophy hunting, poaching, and trafficking of endangered animal parts such as tusks and horns, skin, and game meat. They can also lend their voice when they see a need for pro-active government action. As an example, thousands of wildebeest, deer, antelopes, and zebras die when crossing the Mara River in Kenya during the annual migration mainly because of the extremely steep slopes of the river, much more than are killed by the river or land predators. Flooding has resulted in the steep slopes. It is a sad spectacle to see a huge number of animals falling one on top of the other and getting injured or dying in the process. This grim scenario is watched by tourists wanting to observe the migration who also park their vehicles near the banks of the river to get a closer view. One wonders why the government, which earns so much from eco-tourism, cannot flatten the steep slopes using excavators or create safer crossings along the river, and also prevent tourists from blocking the path of the migrating herds near the river. The migration now of thousands of wildebeest and others could end up as a trickle in the decades ahead if nothing is done to mitigate the losses. As I mentioned earlier wildlife needs active human intervention to ward off possible extinction.

The trans-location of endangered wildlife must be seriously considered. There were plans to relocate the Gir lions in Gujerat, India to Madya Pradesh in case of any war or other calamity but it has been put on hold for decades now. So is the plan to re-introduce the extinct Indian cheetah back in its natural habitat. Both the Indian cheetah and tiger were decimated by Indian royalty and the British before Indian independence. India has a successful conservation program for tigers, which have made a dramatic recovery in their numbers in recent decades. Wildlife in the deserts of the Middle East especially deer and antelopes have also recovered after a brush with extinction due to government efforts and so has the Siberian tiger recovered in numbers in the icy wilderness of Siberia due to the efforts of China and Russia. In the future, the translocation of endangered animals to large countries that offer better protection may become the final option.

Man forcibly has to play God to ensure the continued existence of wildlife especially those facing extinction. Nursing mother tigers especially in South East Asia need to be helped by providing meat or dead prey animals close to their lairs as a mother tiger's long absence endangers her cubs. This will help reduce the mortality rate of cubs and ensure that the tiger population increases. This method can be done to other extinction-facing animals especially the big cats. Similarly, if the number of lions or cheetahs goes down drastically in sub-Saharan Africa, this could be due to a shortage of prey or disease. However, if this is due to fierce competition from hyenas, then the culling of hyenas needs to be done to ensure the survival of lions and cheetahs, which are more endangered than hyenas. Wildlife experts and researchers can recommend the steps to be taken by the government. Even the forest dwellers, natives, and aborigines should not be allowed to hunt endangered wildlife. Hunting of prey animals by issuing permits and licenses needs to be strictly controlled even if the prey is abundant. Sale of game meat must be banned, and it is appreciable that China has taken strict measures to prevent a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic. Abundant prey like deer, wild boar, antelope, and buffalo means easier kills for the big cats and less trespassing into villages or agricultural areas in search of food. Seeds of fruit and nut-bearing trees can be scattered in the forests by game rangers and the seeds may grow into trees and provide food for a wide array of animals to somewhat compensate for the loss of their habitat. Governments need to have a proactive program of compensating villagers and farmers who lose their crops or livestock to wild animals to prevent revenge-killing or poisoning. The battle for conservation is equally crucial at sea as it is on land and issues such as the finning of sharks, killing of whales, and over-fishing also need to be addressed.

Another controversial practice is the burning of confiscated loot such as rhino horns, elephant tusks and other items on a regular basis by various government authorities. Tens of millions of dollars worth of precious cargo goes up in flames giving those around a sense of false satisfaction. This practice needs to be criticized as these valuable items are unlike counterfeit contraband such as fake CDs or watches. The precious ivory can be stored for future use perhaps even to provide funds for wildlife conservation.

One has to criticize the WWF for not doing enough for wildlife globally. It is time the UN sets up a specialized agency for the protection of wildlife similar to the WHO or UNESCO. Simply positioning some VIPs to head the WWF is not enough. Wildlife conservation and protection are serious matters and only leaders who can voice out and criticize governments are needed to address the various issues. The Nobel Prize Committee could give more focus to conservationists, researchers, and NGOs protecting wildlife. It is time wildlife protection is separated from environmental issues because although they are linked, more focus needs to be given to the former. Pressure must be brought on governments that close an eye to corrupt practices allowing timber smuggling thereby encouraging deforestation or the smuggling of wildlife parts. Punishments to poachers, smugglers and others aiding or abetting should be severe. During the present lockdowns in many countries, the problems facing zoos were highlighted, especially poor revenue collection affecting the welfare of the animals. Governments need to have strict control of zoos to prevent abuse of the animals. It is also time that, legally, wild animals are given special rights – very much like human rights - to correct the injustice done to wildlife. It will be really good if wildlife protection had big-hearted leaders, like billionaire Bill Gates whose foundation helps with socio-economic programs, who could provide leadership and financial assistance . Helping wildlife conservation is truly rewarding and satisfying. Wildlife have no one to turn to except Man and governments to protect them. More young volunteers are needed for wildlife conservation. Planet Earth is also the home for wildlife, and education should encompass knowledge of conservation and the environment through exam topics for essays and comprehension for students as the young are the leaders of the future. In conclusion one can say that the Covid-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to give priority to the welfare of wildlife. Now, most governments will be focused on issues such as unemployment, socio-economic stimulus, and political stability and this could prevail for the whole decade. The Covid-19 pandemic could be a turning point - for the better or worse for wildlife.

Tiger King on Netflix has been stealing all the headlines, with its crazed tales of 'big cat' owners in the States.

It highlighted the startling statistic that there are more big cats in private ownership in the US than in the wild. It was against this backdrop that I set out on safari to see them in their natural Kenyan habitat.

My trip coincided with the 35th anniversary of the release of the Oscar-winning timeless classic, Out Of Africa, based on the memoir of the Danish travel writer Karen Blixen. It stars Meryl Streep as Blixen and Robert Redford, as her aristocratic lover Denys Finch Hatton.

Deborah Calmeyer, the dynamic founder of the ultra-luxe travel specialist Roar Africa arranged a special five-day Out of Africa Tour. The firm organised Robert Redford's first return trip to Africa, so if it was good enough for a Hollywood legend, my girlfriend and I were happy to follow in his footsteps.

Kenya, or British East Africa as it was known at the turn of the 20th century, was Karen Blixen's idea of paradise. She describes moving there in her memoir, Out of Africa, at a time when British and other European colonial land-owners held dominion over vast estates populated with vast numbers of Big Five animals - leopards, rhinos, buffaloes, lions and elephants.

Safari (from the Arabic word meaning 'journey') in Blixen's time, was more associated with big game hunting, a then popular pursuit among the bored and promiscuous aristocratic class, as portrayed in the under-rated British film, White Mischief.

Two kilometres from the Hemingways Nairobi hotel, pictured, is the compact Karen Blixen Museum where the great writer lived for over a decade

Frank's trip to Africa coincided with the 35th anniversary of the release of the Oscar-winning timeless classic Out Of Africa, starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford

Danish travel writer Karen Blixen, whose memoir, Out of Africa, became an Oscar-winning movie

Ernest Hemingway famously embarked on a three-month big game hunt in Kenya, which inspired him to write The Snows of Kilimanjaro and The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.

So it seemed appropriate that the first overnight stop on our trip was the Hemingways Nairobi hotel in the garden city of Nairobi.

'Jambo' meaning hello is a Swahili greeting I would never tire of hearing over the course of the trip and it's always delivered with a smile and a warm Kenyan welcome.

A beautiful airy hotel with lush gardens, Hemingways is a gentle introduction to Africa. We arrived just in time for the bottomless brunch with a Jazz Band playing to a mostly local African upmarket clientele.

The hotel is located in the foothills of the evocatively named Ngong Hills ('Ngong' is taken from the Maasai phrase meaning 'rhinoceros spring').

Two kilometres from the hotel is the compact Karen Blixen Museum where the great writer lived for over a decade. 'I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong Hills' are the opening words from Out of Africa, full of yearning.

Among other accomplishments, Blixen was a talented portrait painter and her work hangs on the walls, alongside black-and-white photos of her sipping Champagne with Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe, and Blixen's well-worn Louis Vuitton travel cases.

'In the highlands,' Blixen wrote, 'you woke up in the morning and thought: Here I am, where I ought to be.'

These highlands are the misty Ngong Hills, and it's where her lover, Denys Finch-Hatton, a big game hunter, was buried over 10 miles away. Blixen placed a white sheet over his tomb so that she could wake up and see it from her garden and grieve.

SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR OVER THE MAASAI MARA

The breathtaking safari lodge Angama Mara. The name of lodge is inspired by the Swahili word for 'suspended in mid-air'

Next up was an hour-long charter flight to a breathtaking safari lodge, Angama Mara. As the plane swept low to land at the lodge's grassy private airfield, there were graceful giraffes and a family of elephants enjoying their pasture in the plains, or mara, below.

The lodge's name is inspired by the Swahili word for 'suspended in mid-air', and that's exactly how it feels from the 30 tented suites situated 980ft (300m) above the Great Rift Valley.

Each suite, designed like a stylish open plan apartment, has a mesmerising view overlooking the Maasai Mara, the loveliest game reserve on the continent.

The pivotal picnic scene from Out of Africa was filmed in the grounds of Angama Mara. As a surprise for us, Roar Africa (which organises safaris in 13 African countries) arranged a picnic on the crest of the Out of Africa kopje that is featured on the movie's poster.

BABOONS WITH A TASTE FOR CHAMPAGNE

Angama Mara offers spellbinding views of the Maasai Mara, the 'loveliest game reserve on the continent'

'Each [Angama Mara] suite is designed like a stylish open-plan apartment,' writes Frank

We were guided up the hill to discover an old-world picnic scene - canvas safari chairs, a wicker picnic basket, tasty picnic food, checked blankets, comfy cushions, a bottle of bubbly, coffee in a Stanley flask, and of course, that spectacular view.

A little unsettling was the nearby sound of a wild dog barking, out of sight but circling silently around the picnic area. Maybe we should have got that rabies shot after all.

After finishing the picnic, we kept our eyes peeled as we descended the hill, but our driver laughed as we told him about our fears about being eaten alive by a vicious wild dog.

He told us that it was just a baboon alerting his family about our presence – it turns out that they are regulars as they hang around to eat the picnic leftovers. Hopefully, the baboons didn't drink all the Champagne we left behind.

THE ROCKING CHAIR SAFARI, THE SAFEST IN THE WORLD

Frank embarked on what Angama Mara playfully calls The Rocking Chair Safari - watching the animals from the comfort of rocking chairs on your bedroom terrace with a pair of binoculars

Later, back at the lodge, I opened a beautiful leather-bound copy of Out of Africa and never have Blixen's words 'you woke up in the morning and thought: Here I am, where I ought to be' felt more appropriate. I picked up the binoculars in the room and sat in the rocking chair on the terrace.

I scanned the golden expanse of the plains with dozens of zebras and impalas grazing silently. I was embarking on what the hotel playfully calls The Rocking Chair Safari. I was impatient to try the real thing, but for now, I would have to make do with a curious furry rotund hyrax, or rock rabbit, peering into our tent, with the cutest little tusks.

Despite being little over a foot in length, I was astonished to discover that the hyrax is the closest living relative to the elephant – this one spends most of the afternoon sun-bathing on a nearby rocky ledge.

Safaris are conducted at sunrise and sunset in completely open game viewing vehicles, with canvas roofs as shelter from the sun. Alice, a local Maasai, was our guide for our game drives. She is highly educated and passionate about wildlife conservation. She was constantly on the walkie talkie to her network of fellow guides (from other resorts in the Mara), directing each other to sightings of the Big Five.

On his safari at Angama Mara, Frank saw a sleepy pride of lions, a buffalo enjoying a mud bath and a lone rhino (stock image)

So within an hour or two, we had seen a pride of sleepy lions and a lone rhino. The following day we saw the same pride of lions stake out a buffalo that had retreated into the relative safety of marshy water.

On our way back to the lodge, we passed a triumvirate of ancient-looking buffalo enjoying a soothing mud bath, and Alice told us that they are known as the resident 'retired generals'.

Alice is a natural story-teller and we learned many surprising facts - who knew that a giraffe's tongue is blue or that they are insomniacs, usually only sleeping for 30 minutes a night, or that an ostrich is the Usain Bolt of the wild, able to run up to 45 miles an hour? Or that a lion sleeps up to 20 hours a day, and that warthogs are one of the few animals that copulate for pleasure? Baby elephants, meanwhile, comfort themselves by sucking their trunks.

While it is well known that the rhino and mountain gorillas are under threat of extinction, giraffes have been quietly suffering what has been called 'the silent extinction', with their numbers dropping by 40 per cent in just 30 years. Hippos are considered to be the most deadly and kill 350 people a year – don't get between them and water!

A LODGE FIT FOR A PRESIDENT OR TWO!

Frank describes the look of Angama Mara, pictured, as being 'architecturally dramatic... an almost dreamlike quality'

Angama Mara's architecturally dramatic guest areas - Maasai brick walls and distinctive cone-shaped buildings -were inspired by colonial-era design in Africa. The beauty of the view has an immediate emotional effect creating an almost dreamlike quality.

The local chef at the lodge serves up delicious meals here with the freshest salads picked from the lodge's shamba or vegetable garden. Kenya's President Kenyatta had only recently departed when we arrived.

But he was not the first President to visit these parts. Barack Obama is half-Kenyan - his father was from a farming family, of the Luo tribe, born on the shores of Lake Victoria in Northern Kenya, his grandfather (a respected Elder) was a medicine man with healing powers.

When he returned with his family in 2006 he was greeted with signs saying 'Obama – welcome home'. They went on safari to the Maasai Mara and a popular tourist stop in the Mara is now the Obama Forest, where he planted a tree.

THE DANCING MAASAI WARRIORS WHOSE WIVES ARE THE HOUSE-BUILDERS

Angama Mara is surrounded by many traditional Maasai homesteads that are built by women

Angama Mara is surrounded by many traditional Maasai homesteads, or manyattas. We drove there and were greeted by villagers dressed in traditional colourful flowing robes performing the jumping dance (the 'adumu') and doing their best to out-jump each other.

We learned that women are still obliged to be the actual house-builders. All the homes we saw were plastered in dried cow dung, the most suitable material, as it is water-proof.

It is a polygamous culture, but in practice the husband can only marry again with the permission of the existing wife, and only if the man is wealthy enough to support more than one wife, wealth being measured in the number of cows owned.

Afterwards, on our way back to the lodge, we were relieved when our 20-something Maasai guide Alice told us that her generation is reluctant to embrace polygamy.

THE TIGER KINGS – FROM THE TOWER OF LONDON IN THE 13TH CENTURY TO NETFLIX

From the 1200s until 1835, the Tower of London was the home of the Royal Menagerie, set up by King Henry III to house a gift of three 'leopards' (most likely lions) from the Holy Roman Emperor

Kenya has impeccable Royal connections. The then Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip spent some time in February 1952 at Treetops Hotel in the Aberdare National Park where they saw elephants, baboons and warthogs and witnessed two rhinos squabbling over a waterhole.

It was at the nearby Sagana Lodge (now used as a Presidential retreat) at the foot of Mount Kenya where the Princess learned the sad news that her father, King George VI, had died and that she was to be Queen.

Of course, the Queen is not the first Royal to encounter exotic animals. From the 1200s until 1835, the Tower of London was the home of the Royal Menagerie, set up by King Henry III to house a gift of three 'leopards' (most likely lions) from the Holy Roman Emperor.

Henry III's Plantagenet crest even featured three lions. Who would have thought that Joe Exotic (aka the Tiger King) was actually following in hallowed Royal footsteps as a keeper of big cats?

Present-day royals have continued their love affair with Africa. Prince William spent some of his gap year in Laikipia in Kenya, and has returned several times, endearing himself to the Kenyan people by announcing that he was learning Swahili.

He even themed his 21st Birthday party bash at Windsor Castle around Out of Africa. In fact, he proposed to Kate Middleton while at a remote lodge at Rutundu in Laikipia County in Kenya in 2010.

Laikipia was our next destination - and Roar Africa arranged for a two-seater Cessna plane to take us on the hour-long journey there. As we drew closer, it was easy to see what attracts the Prince to this part of Kenya. With Mount Kenya as the backdrop, its endless rolling grasslands and thorny acacia trees provide the perfect ecosystem for the Big Five.

THE CACTUS FENCE DETERRING NIGHT PROWLERS

The stunning Segera Retreat, pictured, which sits in 50,000 acres of wild Kenyan savanna. Guests are housed in six solar-powered thatched villas

The gardens at Segera Retreat play host to a superb collection of contemporary African sculpture and installations. There's a nice pool, too (pictured)

The truly wonderful Segera Retreat, our lodgings for the next three nights, is a stunning self-styled oasis of luxury in 50,000 acres of wild Kenyan savanna.

Six solar-powered thatched villas in a lush, landscaped garden give guests access to unparalleled comfort. The gardens play host to a superb collection of contemporary African sculpture and installations.

As soon as we arrived, we were whisked off to a beautiful setting by a stream for a delightful open-air lunch, in precisely the same spot that President Kenyatta and his wife had enjoyed a few months earlier.

As if on cue, two elephants appeared and go mano a mano, fighting for supremacy. The older and larger one was vanquished and chased for at least half a mile until his humiliation was complete.

Segera Retreat's mission is 'to create an eco-sphere, a sustainable relationship between the local community, the wildlife and its thrill-seeking guests'

A villa bedroom at Segera Retreat, which is owned by wealthy German entrepreneur Jochen Zeitz

Frank describes Segera Retreat as beautiful and luxurious with 'Michelin-star quality meals prepared by local chefs'

Segera Retreat is owned by Jochen Zeitz, a wealthy German entrepreneur, who founded the Zeitz Foundation, which invests in conservation and community projects, including the Tree of Life reforestation project where one million trees (in the shape of a rhino) are being planted.

By removing fences and opening migration corridors, Zeitz has transformed Segera Retreat into a thriving wildlife conservation area, with a profusion of extraordinary birdlife and many endangered and rare species including Patas monkeys and Grevy's zebras.

Instead of a traditional fence in front of our villa to keep out Big Five night prowlers, there was a rather beautiful flowering 12-ft-high cactus tree hedge in front that acted as a deterrent.

Apparently the big cats are not fans of succulents. Well, at least we hoped that wasn't true. That night, against the backdrop of a dazzling starry sky, there were the sounds of an elephant devouring one of the trees on the compound and a lion growling.

It felt like it was at our door-step, but we tried to reassure ourselves that a lion's roar can carry for five miles, so perhaps he was further away than we thought.

ELVIS THE ROCK 'N ROLL SAFARI GUIDE WHO WILL LEAVE YOU ALL SHOOK UP

Frank's safari guide at Segera was the 'intrepid and fearless' Elvis, who is 'the man' if you're looking for a thrill-seeking game drive. Pictured is a herd of elephants roaming the Segera conservation area

Our local safari guide at Segera was the intrepid and fearless Elvis, and he was indeed the ultimate rock 'n' roll tour guide.

If you are looking for a thrill-seeking game drive, Elvis is the man.

He will enjoy driving you through a herd of 100 giant-horned buffalos that might leave you All Shook Up or do a drive-by of a family of hungry hyenas.

Just as you are catching your breath, he will veer down a meandering dirt track where you might see a leopard looking languorously from a crooked wind-bent tree until the tracks end at a spectacular waterfall, where a collection of baboons stare enchanted by the light reflecting in the water and creating a vivid rainbow effect.

It's as primal a scene as you can get on this earth. There is nothing quite like it.

THE BIRD'S NEST THAT ATTRACTS A PRIDE OF LIONS

The Segera Lodge boasts the Bird's Nest - a stylishly designed two-storey treetop escape that offers 360-degrees views of the savanna

The interior of the Bird's Nest, which is 'perched near a river teeming with wildlife a 10-minute drive from the main hotel'

Karen Blixen believed that 'there is something about safari life that makes you forget all your sorrows and feel as if you had drunk half a bottle of Champagne — bubbling over with heartfelt gratitude for being alive'. A glass of bubbly is just what we needed after an exhilarating game drive. Elvis drove us for a sundowner at the beautiful Nay Palad Bird's Nest.

From a distance it looks like a giant Afro on stilts, but the Bird's Nest turns out to be a stylishly designed two-storey treetop escape. It is perched near a river teeming with wildlife about a 10-minute drive from the main hotel. It offers 360-degree views of the savanna by day that are matched only by a breathtaking view of the stars at night.

In the morning, guests awaken to the magical sounds of animals at play below – in fact, a pride of lions has been known to spend the night in the ground floor solar powered shower-room. Never has the lilting Swahili expression seemed so appropriate - 'Lala Salama' or 'Sleep Safely'.

THE TIGER MOTH AND THE PINK FLAMINGOS

Frank says Segera Retreat is a thriving wildlife conservation area, with a profusion of extraordinary birdlife and many endangered and rare species

While not quite a private jet, Jochen Zeitz bought the actual mustard-coloured De Havilland Tiger Moth plane that featured in the aerial sequences in Out of Africa. It is now beautifully restored and sits proudly in a hangar on the estate.

Our return charter flight to Nairobi (on a Cessna, not the 90-year-old Tiger Moth, sadly) took us low over the Aberdare Mountain Range, past the Queen's beloved Sagana Lodge and a beautiful freshwater lake, but we did not rouse any pink flamingos like in the beautiful scene from Out of Africa - they prefer the languor of saltwater.

The notoriously hard-to-please Robert Redford said 'I've never travelled like this before' and I can see why, having sampled the delights of Angama and Segera. Roar Africa's carefully curated itinerary captured the glamour of Africa and showcased just why Karen Blixen viewed it as her paradise.

The history of Kenya is full of larger-than-life characters – from Hemingway himself to Lt Colonel Patterson, author of The Man Eaters of Tsavo (played on screen by Val Kilmer), and Sir Henry Delves Broughton, who was prosecuted for the murder of his love rival, as portrayed in White Mischief. More recently, Joe Exotic, aka Tiger King, also stands behind bars, convicted of the attempted murder of a 'Big Cat' rival.

Tiger King was once described as 'like a mythical character living out in the middle of bumf*** Oklahoma who owned 1,200 tigers and lions and bears and s***.'

Forget about visiting the Tiger King's G.W. Zoo or Carole Baskin's Big Cat Rescue. Kenya offers the real deal. And here all your worries will feel like a distant memory. Or as they like to say in Swahili - Hakuna Matata. No worries indeed.

Wildly luxurious! The £102,000 safari billed 'the world's greatest' where guests fly to plush African lodges in an Emirates A319 PRIVATE JET, which has 10 bedroom suites and a shower spa

By Ted Thornhill, MailOnline Travel Editor

It's being billed as 'the greatest safari in the world' – though some might conclude that it's the greatest holiday in the world. Full stop.

Unsurprisingly, it's not cheap. You'll need to find $125,000 (£102,000) to book a place on the 'Roar Africa Emirates Executive Private Jet Safari', but for that whopping sum, you'll go 'beyond first class', flown on a bespoke Emirates A319 – complete with 10 private suites and a 'shower spa' – to four jaw-dropping African camps and lodges.

And the 12-day itinerary includes Africa's 'Holy Grail' experiences - taking in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls (one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World), the Okavango Delta in Botswana (the largest inland delta in the world), Kenya's Great Migration, and the world's last wild mountain gorillas in the forests of Rwanda.

'The greatest safari in the world' will see guests flown around Africa on an Emirates A319 private jet (pictured)

The Emirates A319 (pictured) will be the sole means of international transport throughout the entire journey

The jet, said Emirates, was 'created for guests who want to go beyond first class and reflects the glamour of a bygone era, when air travel was both exclusive and an integral aspect of luxury travel experiences'

The trip, which takes place in August 2021 and is being offered to just 10 people, begins with a night at the five-star Burj Al Arab Jumeirah hotel in Dubai.

The Emirates A319 the guests board the next day for Africa will be the sole means of international transport throughout the entire journey.

They will feel like royalty – if they aren't already.

The Emirates private A319 has a 'powder room, an expansive lounge which functions as a communal gathering space or restaurant, and a cabin crew committed to providing the highest levels of personal service'. And five-star bathrooms

Pictured are the suites on the Emirates A319

The jet, said Emirates, was 'created for guests who want to go beyond first class and reflects the glamour of a bygone era, when air travel was both exclusive and an integral aspect of luxury travel experiences'.

As well as private suites and a private shower spa, there's also a 'powder room, an expansive lounge which functions as a communal gathering space or restaurant, and a cabin crew committed to providing the highest levels of personal service'.

Guests will also enjoy screenings of documentaries about Africa from notables such as historian David Attenborough, conservationists Dereck and Beverly Joubert, and environmentalist and filmmaker Craig Foster.

All the destinations for the trip – which is being run jointly with ultra-luxe travel firm Roar Africa - have been hand-picked 'because of their shared vision and commitment to creating a better future, combined with the charm and hospitality of their local communities and residents'.

They're also extremely luxurious.

The first destination, on August 18, 2021, is Mpala Jena Camp, located in the Zambezi National Park in Zimbabwe, a few miles upstream from Victoria Falls.

The first destination, on August 18, 2021, is Mpala Jena Camp (pictured), located in the Zambezi National Park in Zimbabwe

All the rooms at Mpala Jena Camp, pictured, boast private plunge pools with views of the Zambezi River

Its website says: 'The camp's guest tents are under flowing canvas, with open (yet netted) views of the river and Moroccan influences throughout the décor, a reference to the early Arab explorer's adventures up the Zambezi in search of gold in the 16th century. Decking in front of the tent leads to a private plunge pool with views of the flowing waters of the Zambezi River.'

The second lodge, which the guests will arrive at on August 20, is Duba Plains Okavango Delta in Botswana, which 'evokes the classic African safari style of the 1920's' with 'rooms raised on recycled railway sleeper decking and with stunning views of the surrounding floodplain'.

On August 23 the guests will arrive at the incredible Mara Plains Camp in the Kenyan Maasai Mara. MailOnline Travel can vouch for this one. The author of this story stayed there in 2016, describing it as 'a camp that specialises in making its guests feel like they're kings and queens of the savannah', that 'takes glamping into uncharted territory with luxuriousness and service I didn't know could exist in tents'.

Deborah Calmeyer, founder and CEO of Roar Africa

The expert chaperones accompanying the group, meanwhile, include Deborah Calmeyer, founder and CEO of Roar Africa, Humphrey Gumbo, Roar Africa's specialist safari guide with nearly 20 years of professional guiding experience in multiple African countries - and Dr. Ian McCallum, 'renowned poet, conservationist and psychiatrist who is one of the most eloquent ambassadors for wilderness and wild animals'.

Guests will also 'enjoy interacting with other seasoned professionals in their respective fields with extensive knowledge of their African homeland'.

Included among the 'notable participants who will impart fascinating facts and keen insights into the regions visited' is Zoologist Dr. Lucy King, who will 'speak to her personal conservation journey with elephants, bees, and villages'.

Ms Calmeyer explained that the bucket list experience is designed to deepen knowledge of the natural world.

She said: 'It has never been more important than now to curate experiences that facilitate an understanding of how the natural world works. We have curated this strategic itinerary by working from a place of deep insight and acute understanding of Africa's many strengths and complexities. We have painstakingly selected profound destinations and intimate wildlife discoveries to reveal what must be done to ensure that Africa's people, nature and animals survive and thrive.

'And knowing that time is a non-renewable resource, guests will appreciate the absolute exclusivity and unparalleled ease of travel.

'This authentic experience not only sets a new paradigm in ultra-luxe adventure and sustainable travel, but is a robust catalyst for change by facilitating active participation and insightful dialogue between informed, conscious travellers and local communities. Our goal is to change the philosophy and worldview of leaders, and I truly believe this is the greatest and most impactful safari experience on earth… it will make your wildest dreams come true.'

The trip will be 'carbon neutral with high-quality offsets' and Roar Africa will be donating 100 per cent of the trip's proceeds to The Great Plains Foundation, which 'will go directly towards conservation education programs for young people who live in and around the areas visited'.

The Roar Africa Emirates Executive Private Jet African Safari will also be offered August 28 to September 7, 2022, and in 2023 (dates to be determined).

In the mind-boggling snap shared by Indian Forest Official Ramesh Bishnoi, one can see a deer looking at something. But on taking a closer look, one can spot the predator on the top left corner of the photo.

Twiterratis too have been awestruck by the photo. Captioning the much-liked photo, Ramesh wrote, “Eye contact with predator and prey. Can you spot the predator?”

0,"Cute animal pictures and videos in general are unanimously, undeniably timeless. But pictures and videos of giant pandas take cute to a whole new level. And pictures and videos of giant panda cubs possibly take cute to the highest level.

By October 2017, 42 giant panda cubs had been born at the China Conservation and Research Center, located in Ya’an, China, in the Sichuan province. The staff members at the breeding program decided to make a public debut for 36 of the baby pandas and I’m not sure if anyone can truly handle the cuteness overload.

Out of the 42 newborn pandas at the breeding center, there are 15 pairs of twins. This video from the CCTV Video News Agency features the first public appearance of 36 of the panda cubs, and it’s probably one of the most wholesome videos on Youtube.

Baby pandas typically aren’t in control of their motor skills until about 3-months-old. These panda cubs range in age between 1 to 5-months old, which goes to show why some of them are just miniature giant pandas walking around and why others are even tinier panda babies who can only roll around with their fluffy bodies.

The China Conservation and Research Center not only housed these panda babies, but also the oldest giant panda mother to give birth in 2017. Haizi, a 23-year-old giant panda, had given birth to one of the many pairs of twins that were part of the breeding centers’ public debut.

Li Desheng, one of the breeding program’s giant panda experts said in a statement, “Generally, the maximum breeding age for giant pandas is 20 years old, and pandas older than that are not encouraged to participate in breeding. But Haizi’s success demonstrates the advanced degree of care offered at our center — it is a breakthrough in panda breeding.”

Aside from the obvious but also important humane reasons of why we should care about preserving the panda population, it wouldn’t hurt to add preserving the cuteness to the list.

0,"Professors Darren Griffin and Mike Bruford (Universities of Kent and Cardiff) discuss what is meant by a “whole genome sequence” and how it is revolutionising conservation efforts

The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity’s Targets (2010) required signatory countries, by 2020, to minimise genetic erosion and safeguard genetic diversity. Generating genome sequences of farmed/domesticated animals, their wild relatives, cultivated plants and socio-economically/culturally valuable species is needed to progress this goal. The purpose is to revolutionise our understanding of biology and evolution, safeguard biodiversity and create new societal benefits.

A notable example is the sequencing of the SARS-COV2 genome rapidly led to the ability to test and contact trace. While whole-genome sequencing of a microorganism is straightforward, doing so for more complex (e.g. animal or plant) species is still a relatively new concept. In 2001 the first mammals (human and mouse) appeared, the first bird (chicken) in 2004, and the first endangered species (giant panda) in 2010. Since then, the genomes of innumerable microorganisms, animals, plants and fungi have been sequenced, at least to some degree.

Global loss of biodiversity is alarming and increasing. Efforts that result from genome sequencing are, however, showing real promise slowing this trend. Genomic information can revolutionise traditional conservation efforts and provide novel insights with real-world applications. Generation of quality genomic data and its subsequent analysis, interpretation and application, is however challenging and there is a gap between basic research and practical solutions for conservation managers.

Indeed, robust systems must put in place before genome sequence information can be useful, such as:

A quality, and properly annotated reference genome.

Resequencing of key individuals, and proper analysis of enough of them.

Identification of genes relevant to reproductive fitness and viability.

Functional assays to test the phenotypic consequences of genetic variants.

Comparative data from other species, especially when experimenting on endangered species is ethically unacceptable.

Analytical pipelines to achieve all of the above.

Genomic studies have discovered that ‘species are not an island’ as we previously supposed. Indeed, genetic exchange among species appears to be the rule, not the exception, and may help species adapt (e.g. as shown in recent studies of neotropical butterflies Heliconius). Species identification has genuine implications, where populations, protected by their “species label” can benefit from extensive conservation measures or, conversely, be ignored if they don’t have the right one. Moreover, analysis of multiple genomes across numerous groups highlighted the importance of prioritising conservation of organismal groups with an inherent genetic ability to adapt to their surroundings.

A summary of how good quality genome sequences expedite conservation with real practical solutions is given in the table. On the ‘rubbish in, rubbish out’ principle however, poorer quality information is less useful.

What makes a good genome sequence? “Chromosome-level assemblies”

Modern DNA sequencing technology makes it now not too hard nor expensive to create a poor-quality genome. Assigning large blocks of sequence to an overall genomic “map” of an organism can however be problematic and/or expensive. Sadly, most sequenced genomes do not have a good “map” with all genes ordered and assigned in their proper place on chromosomes. Chromosomes are lengths of DNA (analogous to continents and islands) and in every cell of the bodies of all organisms, they are organised in exactly the same way. Every species has its own unique pattern of organization, like the coloured blocks of a national flag.

For instance, three blocks (red, white, and blue) could depict the flag of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Russia or the former Yugoslavia, depending on the organization. Without this, genome assemblies are little more than a “bag of DNA.” Our work, coupled with contemporary sequencing technologies, uses approaches to take the existing data and visualise directly blocks of sequence as they appear in their rightful place (see figure). We call a full description of this and organised genome a “chromosome level assembly.”

In agriculture, chromosome level assemblies can establish the relationship between the genome and the phenotypes of the plant or animal. They are used extensively in selection and breeding, leading to significant economic impact, more efficient food production and improved global food security. For conservation, with so many species on the CITES threatened/endangered list, such assemblies are essential. For example, some species (like Gyr and Saker falcons) inter-breed readily; hybrids and can be stronger and faster. Others like Peregrines do not form fertile hybrids, however. This is because of differing genome organization among species, something can readily be established with a chromosome level assembly.

At CryoArks we are dedicated to providing a sustainable genomic resource involving collection, curation and DNA extraction from numerous species worldwide. CryoArks aims to break down barriers to conservation management projects caused by permit problems by acquiring a large number of previously collected specimens, and sampling as many new species/populations as possible. Bringing these collections together, both physically and on databases, provides a resource that will be responsibly managed. We will ultimately achieve a step-change in the curation and availability of DNA, tissue and cell line samples, providing a forum for scientists and conservationists, with a self-sustaining resource, allowing conservation genomics to continue around the world.

Eight pandas moved to their new home in the ancient town of Fenghuang in central China's Hunan Province on Friday.

This is the first time the ancient town, also a popular tourist destination, has welcomed giant pandas. The animals will make Fenghuang their permanent home.

With the average annual temperature ranging from 12.6 to 16.7 degrees Celsius, Fenghuang County boasts more than 3,333 hectares of bamboo forest, providing a good habitat for giant pandas.

To provide a good living environment for the new arrivals, Fenghuang has built a panda theme park.

Two of the eight pandas, named Long Sheng and Qing Feng, were born in 2000 and 2007 respectively. The other six pandas were born in 2017. They were transported from southwest China's Sichuan Province to Fenghuang by a special vehicle.

Before the transportation, the eight pandas were placed under observation in the giant panda protection center, and they are now in good health.

Teng Qiong, director of Fenghuang County Forestry Bureau, said that the pandas were transported in refrigerator trucks for their safety and comfort. A total of six trucks were rented, with four vehicles carrying two giant pandas each, while one truck carried enough bamboo and bamboo shoots for five days, and another empty truck was kept on standby.

""During the transportation, we rested at the high-speed service areas for 30 minutes every three hours. The keepers provided food and water for the pandas and carefully observed their health condition,"" Teng said.

Construction of the panda theme park in Fenghuang started at the end of 2018. It includes a panda house, a panda hospital, a feed processing room, a tourist service center, a science museum and other supporting projects. There will be 16 professional keepers to take care of the pandas in the park.",8 pandas start new life in ancient town in central China,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNoaW5lLmNuL25ld3MvbmF0aW9uLzIwMDUyOTkxNzUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://obj.shine.cn/files/2020/05/29/2fad5d82-4192-44bb-bf76-af3d4739b466_0.jpg,2020-05-29,"{'sent': ""Eight pandas moved to their new home in the ancient town of Fenghuang in central China's Hunan Province on Friday.\n\n"", 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Eight'], 'GPE': ['Fenghuang', 'China', 'Hunan Province']}}",Giant White Panda

Machu Picchu and the Great Pyramids may top many travelers' bucket lists, but for me — and countless fellow wildlife lovers — it's hard to beat a Serengeti safari. One day in the wildlife-rich Serengeti has more action than a typical month at home. With hundreds of species across its 12,000 square miles (31,079 square kilometers), you can start the morning watching lion cubs play, followed by a cheetah hunt, elephant dust bath and baby giraffe learning to walk — all before lunch. Every day is a new adventure, and no two Serengeti trips are alike. That's why I first visited in 2009, and it's what kept me going back.

While every wildlife encounter is thrilling, the cherry on top of any Serengeti safari is the chance to witness the Great Migration, which I did on my last visit in October 2018. With 1.5 million wildebeest and hundreds of thousands of zebras and gazelles following the rains for lush pastures and water, this bucket-list sight is among the most miraculous on Earth. It's a rare spectacle that can only be seen in Africa's Serengeti.

What Is the Serengeti?

The Serengeti is a massive African ecosystem that spans 12,000 square miles (31,079 square kilometers) in northern Tanzania and into southwestern Kenya. Within this ecosystem, there's the popular 5,600-square-mile (14,503-square-kilometer) Serengeti National Park, as well as other game reserves and conservation areas like Tarangire National Park. The Serengeti is also home to the Maasai Mara main game reserve in Kenya, as well as the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the world's largest inactive and unbroken volcanic caldera, which is filled with diverse wildlife. Animals can pass freely between the Kenya-Tanzania borders, but humans cannot.

As a vast, expansive ecosystem, it's not surprising the Serengeti's terrain varies wildly. According to Vivian Temba, co-founder of Tanzania safari outfitter Amani Afrika, the area's vastness is what makes it so special.

""The colors are different in every season, and there are new things to experience each time you visit,"" she says via email. ""The Serengeti has many habitats, from open savannahs to riverine forests, acacia woodlands to swamp, and the granite kopjes are pretty impressive, too. The biodiversity is incomparable, really.""

The Animals of the Serengeti

While the Serengeti boasts hundreds of mammal and bird species — 800 to be exact — many travelers head here to see the ""big five"" in the wild: lion, rhino, leopard, elephant and Cape buffalo. Spotting these animals is exhilarating, particularly the elusive leopard and rhino, but these hardly scratch the surface of animals you'll see in the Serengeti.

Most Serengeti National Park safari days start before sunrise and, if you're willing, can continue right up to sunset. (Sunrise and sunset are when animals are most active.) The days can include hours upon hours of driving in an open-air vehicle; this is all on road, as off-roading is prohibited for conservation reasons. Instead of cars and buildings, you're spending the day driving past animals like zebra, wildebeest or warthog. Safari guides will stop for any animal you'd like to photograph, but the zebra, giraffe and wildebeest sightings become so common that, by day two, you'll probably be fine just slowing down and rolling by.

As you watch the spectacular wildlife outside your window, guides, who spend years training in the classroom and field, scan for tracks, poop, birds and plants to ""form a mental map of what might have happened at a location and its surroundings,"" Temba says. ""They make some educated guesses about what may happen next.""

The guides use this intel to locate the big five and other favorites like cheetah or hyena. If you're lucky, the guides will get you to the scene of a hunt just before it happens — although be prepared: On one of my visits we spent two hours slowly following a cheetah hunting a gazelle. And we were only lucky enough to stumble upon it because our guide had a good hunch.

""Guides that go on safaris often, like week after week, can get to know the animals intimately,"" Temba says. ""Often the experienced guide will go searching in familiar terrains to continue their storylines or find out what's happened to the animals since they last visited.""

How to See the Great Migration

On a micro scale, safari guides search for the big five and their guests' favorite animals in action. But on a larger scale, the guides are following the Great Migration, because where wildebeest go, so go the predators.

According to Temba, the Great Migration is a year-round phenomenon. For the majority of the year, the massive wildebeest herds — think about 1.5 million of them — stay within Serengeti National Park.

Between January and March, about 500,000 wildebeest are born there. The herds stay in the central Serengeti in April and May, then slowly move north toward Kenya in search of fresh pasture. The wildebeest reach the Kenya border roughly around late July, which is when the most renowned part of the Great Migration truly begins: the Mara River crossings, where thousands of hungry crocodiles are waiting.

""From July to October, the wildebeest herds are expected to be seen in Northern Serengeti, the Mara River region,"" she says. ""The herds often spill over to the Maasai Mara side [in Kenya], so the best time to be in the Maasai Mara is August and September. It's not black and white, though. The herds continually graze between Serengeti National Park and Maasai Mara. They can cross and re-cross the Mara River, which flows from Kenya into Tanzania, because 'the grass is always greener on the other side.'""

In terms of visiting, lodges, campsites and glamping sites are available all across the Serengeti. Guides typically take guests from one campsite to the next every few days while traversing the Serengeti. Temba and her husband hand-built their dream glamp sites, Aurari Camp in Northern Serengeti and Cherero Camp between Central and Western Serengeti, to provide optimal migration lodging throughout the year. Luxe, larger lodge options — including a Four Seasons with an infinity pool — are available as well.

Do People Live in the Serengeti?

Serengeti National Park itself does not have residents since it has national park status, but many tribes do call the greater Serengeti home. The Maasai is one of the most famous tribes in the area; they live across northern Tanzania and southern Kenya, including areas surrounding the Ngorongoro Crater. Many safari outfitters offer a stop at a Maasai village as part of their tour package, but Temba, whose husband was born and raised near the Serengeti, says these ""cultural experiences"" are a bit contrived.

""Unfortunately, the Maasai villages along the tourist path are quite commercial in nature,"" she says. ""If one is interested in meeting 'real Maasai,' they need to go off the tourist path. For Ngorongoro, it's possible to take an extended trip to camp at certain Maasai villages for an actually authentic experience. You can take a guided trek and have Maasai donkeys help with moving from camp to camp for about six days of hiking.""

Maasai aren't the only ones to call this 12,000-square-mile (31,079 square kilometers) ecosystem home. Other indigenous groups, including Sonjo, Kuria, Ikoma and Hadzabe — the bushmen tribes — live throughout the greater Serengeti.

0,"A rediscovered black-and-white video clip is the last-known footage of the thylacine — also known as the Tasmanian tiger — that was recorded before the marsupial went extinct in 1936.

The 21-second clip shows a thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) pacing in an enclosure at the long-closed Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania, while a narrator talks about the creature's rarity and quirks including its ""striped, unjointed tail.""

""Though, like the [Tasmanian] devil, [the thylacine] is now very rare, being forced out of its natural habitat by the march of civilization,"" the narrator says in the 1935 clip. ""This is the only one in captivity in the world.""

Related: Australia's struggling marsupial: Photos of the Tasmanian devil

There are fewer than a dozen other short films, amounting to just over 3 minutes of footage, that showcase the thylacine before its extinction. But these black-and-white snippets — taken at Beaumaris Zoo and London Zoo — are silent; the newfound one is the only known footage to have sound, according to a statement from the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) of Australia.

This is the first time in 85 years that the newfound clip is being released to the public, the NFSA said. It was found within a forgotten 1935 travelogue called ""Tasmania the Wonderland,"" by researchers at the Tasmanian Tiger Archives, a group that documents thylacine-related material.

In the newly discovered clip, zookeeper Arthur Reid and an associate rattle the thylacine's cage, likely to get the predator to act up or do one of its ""threat yawns,"" which can be seen in this 1933 video clip.

That thylacine's ""yawn"" was meant to be menacing to anything threatening it, Cameron Campbell, curator of the Thylacine Museum website, told NPR in 2014. Both clips, the 1933 one and the newfound clip, show the last captive thylacine, nicknamed Benjamin, although the creature's sex is still unknown.

It's thought that the 9-minute-long ""Tasmania the Wonderland"" was filmed by Sidney Cook (1873–1937), a Brisbane-based filmmaker and exhibitor. It was recorded more than 12 months after the last-known footage of a thylacine, which was taken in December 1933.

Months after this newfound 1935 clip was taken, Benjamin died on Sept. 7, 1936. Even though it was the last thylacine in captivity, its body was not preserved, NPR reported. Thylacines were once common in Tasmania, but their numbers plummeted after Europeans settled there in 1803, according to a 2013 study in the Journal of Animal Ecology , which found that humans alone were responsible for the marsupial's demise .

Despite the dearth of thylacine footage, the NFSA said it's possible that more film may yet be uncovered. Thylacines were shown in zoos in Australia as well as in big cities around the world, including Washington, D.C., New York, London, Antwerp and Berlin; so perhaps unreleased photos or film exist from one of these places, the NFSA said.

A British conservationist in Hong Kong has revealed his shock after finding the grave of a Mansfield police constable who was 'mauled by a tiger' more than 100 years ago.

Andy Cornish, who works for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Hong Kong, found the tomb of Ernest Goucher while out on a walk where he lives.

Mr Cornish, who leads the WWF's global shark programme, studied at the University of Nottingham for five years and said he was ""stunned"" when he found the gravestone.

The stone is in memory of Mr Goucher, a constable of Hong Kong police but originally from Mansfield, who died on duty following the tiger mauling on March 12, 1915.

The stone reads: ""In loving memory of Ernest Goucher, a native of Mansfield, Notts, constable, Hong Kong Police, who, while on duty in the new territory, was mauled by a tiger and died from his wounds on 12th March 1915 aged 21 years.

""Erected by his comrades as a mark of esteem. Gone but not forgotten.""

Mr Cornish explains that the Mansfield officer was attacked by a South China tiger, which occasionally killed people during this period.

He says he stumbled upon the grave after visiting an old cemetery in his area.

""I’d never visited this particularly cemetery before, which I believe is one of the oldest here"", he told Nottinghamshire Live.

""I came in a side entrance and almost immediately found myself in an old area that must have been designated for police and military.

""Gravestones were much more graphic back then, and would describe how people had perished, possibly as they were commissioned by colleagues rather than family.

0,"Giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni remain content and locked down in their Australian home at the Adelaide Zoo.

But despite being on loan until 2024, the bamboo-munching funsters had better not get too comfortable.

As Australasia’s only breeding pair of giant pandas they’ve enjoyed a laid-back, sunny lifestyle and a stream of visitors since moving into their shared home in 2009.

The coronavirus stopped all that.

Not only were the visitors banned, but outside their serene walls sickness and economic ferment overtook the narrative between their home and adopted nation, to the extent that nothing can be taken for granted.

China’s so-called ‘panda diplomacy’ has been one way the growing superpower has extended its influence to friends and trading partners around the world – although sometimes, when things get black and white in diplomatic terms, the cuddly ones are recalled.

Now, even the pandas can’t hide the tension.

In the Pacific, China is splashing billions of dollars on infrastructure projects and health care.

Indeed China’s Pacific plan has been so successful in co-opting our near-neighbours that despite the federal government’s cutting of foreign aid budgets, funding in the Pacific has for the most part been quarantined from cuts in a bid to match the largesse.

It’s also pushing its own barrow through the Belt and Road co-operation and trade initiative that the Victorian government is keen on, but which has met with criticism from the federal government this week.

And then there’s China’s cash splash in Australian education institutions, a trend that has brought into question that sector’s reliance on fee-paying students.

Graeme Smith, a research fellow at the Department of Pacific Affairs, Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs, Australian National University

says China’s attempts at world influence ultimately stems from its domestic intrigues.

“In terms of how we think of soft power in Australia – has China become more attractive to the Australian public – then China’s expensive soft power push has been a colossal failure,” Dr Smith told The New Daily.

“But that’s not the metrics they’re using.

The main target of soft power politics is the tens of millions of cadres who make up the CCP, to reassure them that Xi Jinping is confident, assured and strong in his foreign policy.’’



The increasing fault lines between the United States and China – which started with Donald Trump’s complaints on trade and have escalated to his suggestion the coronavirus outbreak began in a Wuhan laboratory – is making things increasingly difficult for Australia.

After Australia took the lead in seeking an independent inquiry into the pandemic outbreak, China upped its rhetoric, with government mouthpiece the Global Times describing Australia as a “giant kangaroo that acts as the dog of the US”.

That’s more cat scratch than warm and fuzzy giant pandas.

Things got serious though when China slapped a 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley imports, claiming they were against trade rules.

Trade Minister Simon Birmingham also conceded that his Chinese counterpart is not taking his calls, a move he said was “disappointing”.

“The Australian government will always front up to have a conversation, even where we have disagreements,” Mr Birmingham said.

“We think the best way to move through those disagreements is to engage in dialogue.”

The $90 billion economic imperative has often kept Australia on a tightrope when dealing with its largest trading partner, but Victoria University researchers last year suggested that skirmishes over trade may well be overplayed.

They claimed the nation needs to distinguish between a commodity downturn or Chinese economic downturn that would smash iron ore exports and one-off trade snubs caused by diplomatic stoushes.

The big caveat though was education, with Australian universities now heavily reliant on fee-paying Chinese students – a model that has been criticised inside and outside the educational field.

In October the ABC’s Four Corners revealed the Chinese government had co-funded at least four courses at the University of Queensland.

The university’s courses were developed in partnership with its Confucius Institute, one of 13 such Chinese government-funded soft power centres in Australia, which run language and culture classes.

Dr Smith says Australia must recognise that some universities and business schools have been forced by budget cuts to look elsewhere for cash and, in doing so, some have “gone over the top” in tailoring courses to boost revenue and provide a pathway to residency.

He said this approach was not good for Australia or the Chinese students – many of whom may wonder why they paid so much money to sit in a classroom where 90 per cent of their classmates are also from China.

“There were serious issues around mental health and social isolation for this cohort even before the virus hit,” Dr Smith said.

“The call to diversify is sensible, and many universities haven’t pursued this seriously enough … the hard reality is there is no other region which can easily take the place of the PRC – the potential student numbers from India, South-East Asia and Brazil don’t come close.

Feng Chongyi, Associate Professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, says ultimately the soft power push needs to be met with some hard truths about Australia’s values.

Dr Feng has long been critical of Chinese government influence in local Chinese media and on campuses.

In 2017 he was detained in China for 10 days while visiting his mother, and does not see any short-term easing of tensions while the Chinese government remains so hostile to criticism.

“There is nothing wrong for Australia to support the US as a trustworthy partner of democratic alliance,” Dr Feng told The New Daily.

“China’s displeasure stems from the nature of the CCP regime, which has become increasingly hostile to liberal international order and universal values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in recent years.

Australia is entitled to pursue foreign policies in line with its national interests and core values such as human rights, democracy, equality and the rule of law.



“Australia’s relationship with China can be improved if the CCP regime changes its hostility toward universal values and bullying behaviours.”

Dr Feng says Australia cannot afford to try and balance its relationship between the US and China, saying: “Prime Minister Scott Morrison gets it right to characterise the US as an ally and China a business partner”.

“It is wrong to put autocratic China and democratic USA on a par and absolutely right for Australia to side with its democratic ally, USA, when liberal and democratic principles are challenged by the CCP regime.”

And the way forward?

“In dealing with communist China, Australia has to stand firm in upholding its core values and protecting the integrity of its political institutions, educational institutions and business practice and do its best in minimising the negative impact of the CCP united front operations.”
