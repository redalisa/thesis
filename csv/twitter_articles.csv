Canadians sure love their fish.

Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada finally opened Wednesday at the base of the CN Tower, with dozens of visitors exploring almost 40,000 square metres of marine habitat.

The largest indoor aquarium in Canada is home to over 16,000 animals, including sharks, seahorses, electric eels, and poisonous fish.

Even Mayor Rob Ford made a brief appearance at the launch. Reporters learned his favourite marine animal is the great white shark.

“It has a big mouth and it has sharp teeth,” Ford said. “If anything gets in its way, he takes care of it pretty quick.”

But Ford admitted he found ticket prices a little on the high side, at $29.98 for adults, $19.98 for youth aged 6-13 and seniors 65 and over, and $9.98 for kids aged 3-5.

“It’s a bit pricey, but we’ll see what happens,” he said.

Visitors can pet a sting ray, stroke a horseshoe crab, or engage in a stare-off with a cheeky green sawfish on a stroll through the aquarium’s underwater tunnel that is almost 100 metres long.

Andy Dehart, director of husbandry, said he hopes people will learn more about life in the ocean through Ripley’s new venture.

“There’s a lot of amazing things in nature, whether it be male seahorses carrying babies, whether it be fish that are venomous for protection, or even sand tiger sharks, how they can lose 30,000 teeth in a lifetime,” he said.

The $130 million aquarium also features animals displaced during Superstorm Sandy last year.

Justin Culbert, 16, said his father first sparked his interest in marine life years ago. He now keeps a 250-litre reef tank at home.

“My dad (and I) have been going (to aquariums) since I was little and just got into it and loved it,” Culbert said.

The opening also attracted a protester from Marineland Animal Defence, a group advocating for animals in captivity.

Zach Ruiter, 30, said animals belong in the wild.

“A pool is not a home,” Ruiter said.";Ripley's Aquarium Canada opens its doors;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vdG9yb250b3N1bi5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC8xNi9yaXBsZXlzLWFxdWFyaXVtLWNhbmFkYS1vcGVucy1pdHMtZG9vcnMvd2NtL2MxZDU5OGQ5LTU5ZWItNGY2OC1hMDUwLWFhY2Y1Mjg2NmZlYtIBdmh0dHBzOi8vdG9yb250b3N1bi5jb20vMjAxMy8xMC8xNi9yaXBsZXlzLWFxdWFyaXVtLWNhbmFkYS1vcGVucy1pdHMtZG9vcnMvd2NtL2MxZDU5OGQ5LTU5ZWItNGY2OC1hMDUwLWFhY2Y1Mjg2NmZlYi9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;http://storage.torontosun.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297479880000_ORIGINAL.jpg?size=374x;10/16/2013;[{'sent': 'TORONTO\n\nCanadians sure love their fish.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['TORONTO']}}, {'sent': 'Ripley’s Aquarium of Canada finally opened Wednesday at the base of the CN Tower, with dozens of visitors exploring almost 40,000 square metres of marine habitat.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Canada'], 'CARDINAL': ['dozens'], 'QUANTITY': ['almost 40,000 square metres']}}, {'sent': 'The largest indoor aquarium in Canada is home to over 16,000 animals, including sharks, seahorses, electric eels, and poisonous fish.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Canada'], 'CARDINAL': ['over 16,000']}}, {'sent': 'Even Mayor Rob Ford made a brief appearance at the launch.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Rob Ford']}}, {'sent': '“It has a big mouth and it has sharp teeth,” Ford said.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Ford']}}, {'sent': 'But Ford admitted he found ticket prices a little on the high side, at $29.98 for adults, $19.98 for youth aged 6-13 and seniors 65 and over, and $9.98 for kids aged 3-5.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Ford'], 'MONEY': ['19.98', '9.98', '29.98'], 'CARDINAL': ['65']}}, {'sent': 'Visitors can pet a sting ray, stroke a horseshoe crab, or engage in a stare-off with a cheeky green sawfish on a stroll through the aquarium’s underwater tunnel that is almost 100 metres long.\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['almost 100 metres']}}, {'sent': 'Andy Dehart, director of husbandry, said he hopes people will learn more about life in the ocean through Ripley’s new venture.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Andy Dehart'], 'GPE': ['Ripley']}}, {'sent': '“There’s a lot of amazing things in nature, whether it be male seahorses carrying babies, whether it be fish that are venomous for protection, or even sand tiger sharks, how they can lose 30,000 teeth in a lifetime,” he said.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['30,000']}}, {'sent': 'The $130 million aquarium also features animals displaced during Superstorm Sandy last year.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['$130 million'], 'PERSON': ['Superstorm Sandy']}}, {'sent': 'Justin Culbert, 16, said his father first sparked his interest in marine life years ago.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Justin Culbert']}}, {'sent': '“My dad (and I) have been going (to aquariums) since I was little and just got into it and loved it,” Culbert said.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Culbert']}}, {'sent': 'The opening also attracted a protester from Marineland Animal Defence, a group advocating for animals in captivity.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Marineland Animal Defence']}}, {'sent': 'Zach Ruiter, 30, said animals belong in the wild.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Zach Ruiter']}}, {'sent': '“A pool is not a home,” Ruiter said.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ruiter']}}]

It is already the most watched programme of 2017 as audiences have been left amazed by what is under our oceans.

BBC One’s Blue Planet II has been pulling in audiences of 14m, outdoing the likes of Britain’s Got Talent, I’m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here and Strictly Come Dancing.

But here in Hull you can watch the drama of the ocean depths and the colourful coral reefs up close with a trip to The Deep.

In the first episode of the Blue Planet II, one of the stars of the show was Percy the tusk fish which was captured trying to break a clam on a bowl of coral.

The Deep also has tusk fish and, who knows, other residents may become stars of the show in one of the five remaining episodes.

“Everyone is loving the recent launch of Blue Planet II,” The Deep’s conservation officer Suzanne Rowe said. “From episode one, everyone marvelled at the tool use behaviour of the tusk fish.

“Its ingenious method of banging the clam against an exposed coral skeleton to get at the soft flesh inside was amazing to watch and demonstrated that tool use does indeed go beyond the intelligence of primates and birds.

“The Deep is home to another, more colourful, species of tusk fish – the Harlequin tusk fish. Its vivid orange and blue stripes really make it stand out from the crowd.

“Like other tusk fish, its large crushing fangs enable it to break open the tough shells of cockles, mussels and clams. When they reach maturity the teeth of these fish turn bright blue, adding to the intrigue.”

As well as gaining an insight into the weird and wonderful world of our seas, conservation is also a big part of the television series.

“The Deep demonstrates the diversity of our world’s oceans,” Suzanne said. “Sadly many of these are now under threat.”

Here Suzanne discusses some of the marine life which features at The Deep and its importance to the global environment.

Coral

The next episode of Blue Planet focuses on coral reefs and The Deep actually cultivates its own coral.

“There are over 2,500 species of coral inhabiting our world’s reefs, with over 1,000 of these essential to building the structure of the coral reef itself,” Suzanne said.

“Apart from being beautiful in structure and colouration, coral reefs are an essential nursery ground for a number of fish and shark species. Many of these juveniles wouldn’t survive if they were suddenly forced into the open ocean.

“Unfortunately, corals are dying off at an alarming rate due to global warming and ocean acidification. They act as a buffer from storm surges and rising tides and are home to 25 per cent of all marine life on the planet.”

Sharks

Sharks have already featured on Blue Planet II with six gills seen greedily devouring a whale carcass.

Hull is home to a variety of sharks, including nurse, epaulette, zebra and reef sharks who could all yet feature in the series.

“There are over 500 species of shark in the world,” Suzanne said. “They can be found in just about every ocean habitat, from the shallow tropical reefs and the deepest of seas to the coldest Arctic Ocean.

“Occurring in all shapes and sizes, they range from the smallest dwarf lantern shark (the length of an adults hand) to the enormous whale shark which, at 12 metres, is the largest fish in the world.

“Spotting sharks in the water is an indicator that a habitat is healthy, most definitely a species that should be welcomed not feared.”

Jellyfish

A field of tiny glowing jellyfish feature in the trailer for Blue Planet II so expect them to make an appearance at some point. The Deep has its fair share of the ghostly marine creatures.

“Despite their name, jellyfish are not actually fish but a type of large gelatinous plankton,” Suzanne said. “With a fast reproductive rate and short lifespan, they are an important food source for animals such as large fish, turtles and even other jellyfish.

“Increasing ocean temperatures are contributing to regular jellyfish blooms – an unwelcome sight to the regular beach-goer.

“They act as drifting nurseries for juvenile fish and crabs, protected from predators by a wall of stinging trailing tentacles.”

Penguins

Blue Planet II will cover all aspects of ocean life so it will be a surprise if the charismatic penguin doesn’t make an appearance.

The 13 gentoo penguins at The Deep have become stars of the aquarium since arriving three years ago.

“There are 18 species of penguin in the world,” Suzanne said, “with the largest being the emperor penguin and the smallest the little penguin. In all, of these are classed as threatened or endangered due to a reduced number of fish and loss of habitat.

“But penguins do more than make us smile – they are an important link between the land and sea. Carrying nutrients between both habitats, their faeces are an essential fertiliser, enriching both the soil and the seabed.""

Turtles

This iconic species will feature heavily in Sunday’s episode on corals which will show green turtles being pampered by fish who will clean the animals of parasites and algae.

The Deep has recently taken in two previously injured loggerhead turtles who have settled well in the Endless Ocean tank.

“All seven turtle species are considered threatened or endangered,” Suzanne said. “Man-made threats such as pollution, habitat destruction and the loss of nesting beaches are all contributing to population decline.

“Having been around for millions of years, they truly are ancient beings. Only able to breed from 35-40 years old, they live most of their lives at sea, only returning to the beach where they were born to lay their eggs.”

Starfish

Such is their numbers and variety, you will see starfish appear throughout the Blue Planet II series and there are plenty at The Deep which you can even handle in the touch tank sessions.

“Also known as sea stars, anyone who has seen a starfish will know that it bears no resemblance to a fish,” Suzanne said.

“There are around 2,000 species of starfish living in our world’s oceans, from the tropical waters to the freezing Arctic and from shallow reefs to the deep sea. So named for their typical five-armed appearance, there are some with ten, 20 and even 40 arms!""

Medical importance

Suzanne and other marine experts and conservationists hope the popularity of programmes like Blue Planet II will raise awareness of the oceans’ importance.

“It’s clear the animals in the ocean depend on each other for survival,” she said, “and we depend on the oceans for the survival of the land.

“But our dependence on them runs even deeper than a means for food, industry and tourism. Many marine species have contribute to ground-breaking medical diagnosis and treatments.

“Did you know that barnacles have helped create ‘Medhesive’, a bacteria resistant surgical glue that can be used both inside and outside of the body to repair life threatening wounds and injuries.

“Pain relief for those resistant to morphine has been derived from the venomous cone snails and glowing cells found in jellyfish are being used to find tumours hidden deep within the body.

“Marine sponges are already being used to stop advanced breast cancer cells in their tracks. It’s strikingly obvious that if we want to save ourselves, we need to save the ocean – the life source of this planet.”

The Deep's stars that should feature on Blue Planet II

There have been two episodes of the show so far with the humble tusk fish the only animal to feature on the show which can also be seen at The Deep.

A grouper will feature in this Sunday’s episode which can use sign language. The Deep has its own potato grouper called Eddie but it has no other groupers to chat to!

We pick some of the creatures at The Deep which could and should feature on Blue Planet II.

Green sawfish - found in The Deep’s Endless Oceans tank, sawfish are a type of ray.

These strange looking fish are specialised feeders who use their impressive toothed rostrum to sift through the sand in search of prey and can immobilise them with one hard swipe.

Atlantic mudskipper - found next to The Deep’s Lagoon of Light, this amphibious fish can walk on land using its specialised pectoral fins during low tide.

Their party trick is the ability to roll their eyeballs in their specialised water-filled sockets to refresh their faces and gills with oxygenated water, which allows them to breathe on land.

Living in the world’s mangrove forests, these are highly sensitive creatures with great ecological importance.

Bicolor parrotfish - found in The Deep’s lagoon tank, parrotfish come in an exciting array of colours and has an unusually shaped mouth.

Scraping algae and food from coral reefs, they ingest a lot of rock, which is excreted as fine white sand – the stuff we like to sunbathe on.

They also have another trick up their sleeve by tucking themselves into bed at night in a cosy mucus sleeping bag, protecting them from parasites and predators.

Porcupine pufferfish - the Deep’s pufferfish can be found in the lagoon tank. This fish is pretty cute, but there is no denying it’s an oddball.

Pufferfish have the ability to inflate their body to twice its size when threatened, making its sharp spines stick up. Despite its spiky exterior, this fish has a fun and quirky personality – but it is highly venomous.

Wolf eel - found in The Deep’s Cool Seas exhibit this creature is not a wolf, nor is it an eel.

These animals are relatively shy but they have one of the strongest jaws in the animal kingdom.

Their fang-like teeth are designed to deliver a nasty bite which is perfect for eating sea urchins and crabs.

Wolf eels also have another quirky adaptation. Their blood contains a special antifreeze factor, keeping their blood fluid at temperatures as low as -30C.";Loving Blue Planet II?

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Rays and Skates – Skate Video

by Dick Marquand

Rays and skates often cause anglers confusion. Let’s take a look at some of the members of the Order Rajiformes and their various differences. This order includes stingrays, eagle rays, skates, electric rays, as well as tropical species such as manta rays and sawfish. Although rays and skates at first glance appear to look very similar, they are quite different when you know what to look for. Stingrays, for example, are nearly always nearly black on top and light grey underneath. The head of the stingray blends into the body.

The head of the eagle ray, by contrast, is at the front of the body jutting forward and rises above the back appearing almost frog-like. The back of the eagle ray is also much lighter in colour and tends to be greenish with dabs of blue.

Skates are more diamond-shaped and have an upper body colour that is usually pinkish-brown and speckled with darker markings. Like the stingray the head of the skate blends into the body barely rising above the back at all. Skates also tend to have wider fleshier tails.

Caught at Nape Nape Beach, North Canterbury, during a surfcasting competition.

Stingray Facts:

There are two species of stingray commonly found in New Zealand waters, these being the long-tailed stingray Dasyatis thetidis and the short-tailed stingray Dasyatis brevicaudata. The easiest way to differentiate between these species is by the length of the tail.

The long-tailed stingray has a whip-like tail which is longer than its body. About a quarter of the way down the tail one or two long serrated barbed spines project from the upper side. On the other hand, the short-tailed stingray has a thicker tail which is shorter than the length of its body. It too has one or two barbed spines which may measure up to 30 centimetres in length.

A Stingray Barb can cause a fatal injury

Stingrays are not generally regarded as dangerous to humans although over the years there have been incidents where swimmers have been killed or seriously injured by their flailing tail barbs.

Stingrays have a habit of resting on the bottom sometimes in quite shallow water. It is thought that swimmers may have accidentally stood on or surprised a stingray in such situations causing it to lash-out in an attempt to escape. Fatalities from stingrays are extremely rare.

Although the spines contain venom and a strike can be very painful, they are usually deadly. When deaths to people have occurred it is when the barb has hit a vital organ. Most notably when Steve Irwin, the Australian wildlife expert, was tragically killed by a stingray barb in 2006 when it pierced his heart

How big can a stingray get

Stingrays can grow to a weight of at least 240kg (500lb) and a width across the flaps of between two and three metres. They frequent shallow inshore waters, particularly harbours, inlets and just offshore of the breaker line on sheltered surf beaches, where they feed on crabs and shellfish. Both species are found in the waters of the North Island and generally, it is the short-tailed stingray that is found in our southern waters. The colouration of the upper surface is usually dark grey, brown or black.

Generally, stingrays are not targeted by anglers, but when they are accidentally taken on a surfcasting outfit, they put up a long and powerful fight. One warm autumn day, while fishing on the bottom inside the mouth of Thompson Sound, one of my crew, Bill Routhan of Hokitika, had a solid hook-up in about 10 fathoms. The fish moved off on a long powerful run, testing the line and my old Penn Sea Boy reel.

We had no idea what Bill was hooked onto until an hour later when the shape of a ray appeared beneath “Samara.” As Bill eased the fish alongside, Pete missed with the gaff and another 20 minutes passed before the ray could be coaxed close enough to be secured. The short-tailed stingray had two spines on the back of its tail, the largest of which was 12 centimetres long. It was an amazing capture on a thin wire hook which had foul-hooked the ray under one wing. The ray later weighed in at 34kg (75lb).

Surfcasting success after a long drawn out battle with light gear. Barry Toomey with his 40kg Eagle Ray caught at Tukurua Beach, Nelson. Read about this eagle ray being caught here.

Eagle Rays:

The eagle ray Myliobatus tenuicaudatus is a common species in estuaries and harbours of the North Island where it can be seen basking in the warm shallows or slowly moving along the bottom in search of crabs and shellfish. They are relatively uncommon in the South Island but have been recorded as far south as Poison Bay near Milford Sound. However, eagle rays can be seen in large numbers, particularly at low tide in Westhaven Inlet near Collingwood.

The species can have a wingspan of up to 1.5 metres and is easily recognised by its head which protrudes in front of the swept-back delta-shaped wings. It has a long whip-like tail with a sharply pointed barbed spine protruding from the upper side, not far behind the body. The colouring on the upper surface is greyish brown to greenish-brown with brilliant blue markings.

The eagle ray provides great sport on a light surf outfit or boat rod and generally gives a hard fight with long powerful runs. The largest I have seen would weigh around 50kg (110lb).

Skates:

There are two species of skates that are likely to be seen by anglers around the coastline of the South Island; they are the rough skate Raja nasuta and the smooth skate Raja innominata.

The rough skate is found in shallow waters on a muddy or sandy seafloor and is commonly caught by surf anglers on the west coast of the South Island. The species can grow to around one metre across the wings, but most of the specimens that I have seen have been half that size.

This enormous skate was caught by Liz Melrose while surfcasting at Coopers Lagoon near the Rakaia River mouth. It weighed a hefty 40kg and measured seven feet in length. We think this particularly large specimen is a rough skate but cannot be 100 percent certain. Note the tail with its sharp thorns has been removed.

Three rows of small spines or prickles run down the top side of the tail which does not have the spine or barb that is found on the stingrays and the eagle ray. The colouration on the upper surface is brown with dark marbled patches.

More about Rough Skate – Raja nasuta which are often caught by surfcasters

One night while fishing the shallow waters of Poison Bay, I had some great sport fishing for skates with a light threadline outfit. Although only 50 centimetres across the wings, the skates put up a terrific fight on 3kg line with plenty of long hard runs. I landed and released five and lost at least as many.

The smooth skate is not encountered as often by anglers as the rough skate, as it prefers deeper waters. This species grows to over 1.5 metres across the wings and as the name suggests, the upper surface is usually smooth. Colouration is usually grey with dark brown spots.

I have only ever caught two smooth skates, both in Milford Sound. One was a large specimen perhaps two metres across and was taken at the head of the sound near the Sinbad River mouth. It came up from the depths like a grey blanket and after a quick photograph, it was released.

In his book “A Treasury of New Zealand Fishes,” David H. Graham makes mention of one in Milford Sound that was over seven feet in length. He also reports that in 1862, a large skate was caught that was ten feet in length and weighed 4221b. I would imagine that both these fish were smooth skates.

Skate eat molluscs, crustaceans, and various species of small fish likely found on the bottom. Skate will also take fish that have been hooked by anglers lines. Skate is often caught by surfcasters. Here is a skate caught surfcasting by Allan Burgess at Amberley Beach. Few surfcasters would deliberately try to catch skate. If you are attempting to catch one, as you might during a surfcasting competition, then a really long distance cast as far beyond the surf-zone as possible seems to be the way to go.

Eating Rays and Skates

The wings of both rays and skates are good eating. Skate has a delicate flavour and is very good cooked in a variety of ways but they are not a popular fish in New Zealand. Skate wings are sold in shops which have been skinned with the cartilage still in the centre. Stingrays are not usually eaten in New Zealand although they are popular in other parts of the world.

Other Rajiformes

Electric rays are widespread throughout New Zealand’s coastal waters and although usually seen amongst trawl catches, a few are also taken by line anglers. They grow to over one metre in length and are capable of delivering a severe electric shock. Two species of the blind electric ray are also found in our waters but these are deep water inhabitants and are not likely to be encountered by anglers.

Manta rays are occasionally seen by offshore anglers fishing the northern coastal waters of New Zealand. They can easily be recognised as they swim just beneath the surface by the two projecting horns each side of the head. Mantas are known to grow to at least 6 metres between the wings and attain a weight of at least 2000kg. They feed on small fish and zooplankton and are occasionally seen leaping clear of the sea’s surface. It is very unlikely that this species would venture into the cooler waters of the South Island.

Sawfish are not found in New Zealand waters but are nevertheless a close relative of the rays. The Longcomb sawfish, Narrowsnout sawfish or Green sawfish Pristis zijsron can reach a length of 10 metres of which at least 2 metres is its saw-like rostrum.

Rays and Skates – Release Unwanted Fish

So, when you next land a ray or a skate, take a couple of seconds to decide if you are going to use it. Although the flesh on the wings is edible if prepared correctly, it is my opinion that there are better food species in our waters. If you aren’t going to use the fish, don’t kill it for the sake of killing. Instead, show a little mercy and release your catch. The text of this article has been extended by Allan Burgess.

(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune/TNS) Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Her passion for marine science started with a pair of goldfish, Salt and Pepper 1 / 3 Back to Gallery

Cheryl Mell’s road to Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium seems almost preordained.

As a kid growing up in Morton Grove, Ill., she was never able to have the most common pets.

“Both my sisters and my mother have allergies to dogs and cats,” she says, sitting in her office at the Shedd, where she is senior vice president for global field expeditions and conservation ambassador. “(My interest) truly started with a pair of carnival goldfish. Salt and Pepper, one white, one black. So at a young age I got into fish.”

She had an aquarium by the time she was in the fourth grade, and by seventh grade she knew she wanted to study marine biology. By her junior year of high school, she was scuba diving.

Mell went off to the University of Miami, where she received her bachelor of science degree in biology and marine science in 1989 and a master of science in education, biology and secondary education in 1991.

In an interesting twist, while doing undergrad work she spent a lot of time on the Shedd’s research ship, the Coral Reef II, which the University of Miami leased.

“I came back after grad school and stopped in Chicago to see family,” Mell says. “On my bed was an ad, cut out of the paper, for an educator at the Shedd. … I applied as soon as I saw the position.”

She got the job and has been at the Shedd for 24 years. It has been a wonderful relationship.

“I’m so lucky,” she says. “My passions are education and marine life. To bring the two together, it doesn’t get any better.”

During a recent visit in her office, Mell, 47, talked about her time at the Shedd and three of her favorite topics: conservation, education and travel. This is an edited transcript of the conversation.

Q: Is aquatic conservation what you consider your area of expertise?

A: Yes, it’s one of my focuses. This is my seventh job here. I always say the Shedd was a good fit for me, and I was a good fit for the Shedd. I’m a marine educator at heart.

Q: Your bio mentions that part of your job is providing travel opportunities. What kind of travel do you have a hand in?

A: I work a lot with tourism businesses. Right now, we’re working with New Brunswick in Canada. We love to take Shedd Aquarium members to these beautiful sites. For the most part, our audience has been members or friends of members. We recently had a woman who brought a friend, a musician (she met at a CSO concert), and she went on the Amazon trip. What I loved, she saw things with the eye of an artist.

Q: And you’re also reaching out to younger people.

A: This year, for the first time, we’re doing a trip aimed at millennials, open just to people 21 to 35 years old. It’s to Cancun, and they will swim with whale sharks. Here’s this group of young professionals who are so excited to get in the water with the largest shark in the world. What’s killing me: I planned it, but I don’t qualify in the age group.

Q: Whale sharks?

A: They go to Cancun in the summer to feed on plankton. The divers will go in the water, a pair at a time.

Q: Do people in that age group present any special challenges?

A: Millennials want short trips, with a price point not to go over $1,800. But they want Wi-Fi in their hotel, so they can brag to their friends.

Q: You have been to seven continents and have seen some amazing things. How do you maintain a sense of wonderment, curiosity?

A: It comes much easier than you expect. You meet fellow travelers: “Where do you go next?” “Did you go down that street?” The travel community just inspires. I have visited almost 100 countries. But it’s not about a checklist. I love traveling because it broadens my horizons. I do a lot of conservation travel. It settles me, gives me an appreciation.

Q: Do you have a favorite spot?

A: For aquatic life, animals, the Galapagos Islands. The animals have no fear. It’s phenomenal. You can get right up to them. The other place is the Peninsula Valdes, off the coast of Argentina. There are whales, rookeries of penguins. We climbed a lighthouse and saw orcas going by. At almost the end of the day, we saw a herd of elephant seals on the beach. It was there I had an aha moment. I slipped and fell on the beach — all these small pebbles. And the pebbles were warm. No wonder the seals lie on that beach.

Q: Where are you going next?

A: In August we’re going to Borneo. We’re going there to scout it out. We’re partnering with Brookfield Zoo on this. They have experts on orangutans; Shedd has experts on coral. We’re looking at a 10- or 12-day trip in 2017. I think there are a lot of Shedd members who would like to make that trip.

Q: People taking one of your trips will see things that fascinate them. How do they make the leap to “I want to do something to help?”

A: A lot of the magic comes from the trip leaders. There’s always a Shedd staffer on each trip. They hear a leader talk so passionately about an endangered fish, and maybe they can’t save that fish, but they can do something when they get home.

Q: Educate themselves? Teach their children? Any books or videos you recommend?

A: I joke because I’m a 47-year-old woman who watches Channel 7 (WLS-TV) Saturday mornings to see all the animal programming. A great way (to do something is) the Great Lakes Action Days (a Shedd initiative to restore habitat; several events are scheduled from July to October). There are beach cleanups, or you go out and capture amphibians, you test waters. (But) there are a lot of good organizations, a lot of ways to get involved.

Q: After we’re done here, you’re going diving in the “Wild Reef” exhibit. Is that for fun?

A: It’s a working dive. We dive several days a week. It’s a cleaning and feeding dive.

Q: What’s it like?

A: There are leopard sharks, Napoleon wrasse (also called humphead wrasse) and a green sawfish named Ginsu. She makes her beds — she has two — on the bottom. We go to the bottom and smooth the gravel. We literally make her bed. Feeding them is fun, but making Ginsu’s bed is my favorite part of it.

Q: What is your favorite exhibit at the Shedd?

A: I actually have two, both in “Wild Reef.” I love the garden eels because, as a diver, I can tell you that seeing them in the wild can be tricky since they duck down into the sand very fast. At Shedd, you have the opportunity to see them fully and at eye level. The second are live algae and coral habitats, just past the main shark exhibit. They are so beautiful. It’s so magical to see live coral and algae with bright fish swimming by.

Q: Do you have any other favorite animals?

A: The manta ray. They can grow up to 20 feet long, but they are actually beautiful gentle giants. I’ve been lucky enough to see them in the wild, and I was so moved by their grace and beauty that I actually got a tattoo of one while I was in Tahiti.

Q: What do you do when you’re not working?

A: I’m not married, no kids, but I have six nieces and nephews. I’m referred to as cool Auntie Cheryl. They’ve come here all their lives. Sleepovers, everything. Summertime is a good time for me. I’m an avid kayaker. I’m on the river all the time. I live next to Wrigley Field, so my dog, Fozzie Bear, and I spend a lot of time at the Wilson Avenue beach. I spend a lot of time with family and friends. I live by that Southport Corridor, with a lot of great restaurants.

Q: What kind of music do you listen to?

A: I kick it old school. Van Morrison, Steely Dan, James Taylor.

Q: Are there any must-see places you haven’t seen yet?

A: I’m dying to go to India. And Papua New Guinea and Madagascar. But for all of them, I’d need a minimum of three weeks.";Her passion for marine science started with a pair of goldfish, Salt and Pepper;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vZmVhdHVyZXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9IZXItcGFzc2lvbi1mb3ItbWFyaW5lLXNjaWVuY2Utc3RhcnRlZC13aXRoLWEtMTI3MDMxMzIucGhw0gFkaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9mZWF0dXJlcy9hbXAvSGVyLXBhc3Npb24tZm9yLW1hcmluZS1zY2llbmNlLXN0YXJ0ZWQtd2l0aC1hLTEyNzAzMTMyLnBocA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://s.hdnux.com/photos/71/54/56/15125393/3/rawImage.jpg;02/23/2018;"[{'sent': 'Her passion for marine science started with a pair of goldfish, Salt and Pepper\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Salt']}}, {'sent': ""Shedd Aquarium's Cheryl Mell, senior VP of global field expeditions and conservation ambassador, swims inside the shark tank on June 18, 2015 in Chicago."", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Cheryl Mell', ""Shedd Aquarium's""], 'ORG': ['VP'], 'GPE': ['Chicago']}}, {'sent': '(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune/TNS)', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Abel Uribe']}}, {'sent': ""Shedd Aquarium's Cheryl Mell, senior VP of global field expeditions and conservation ambassador, swims inside the shark tank on June 18, 2015 in Chicago."", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Cheryl Mell', ""Shedd Aquarium's""], 'ORG': ['VP'], 'GPE': ['Chicago']}}, {'sent': '(Abel Uribe/Chicago Tribune/TNS)', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Abel Uribe']}}, {'sent': 'Her passion for marine science started with a pair of goldfish, Salt and Pepper 1 / 3 Back to Gallery\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Salt']}}, {'sent': 'Cheryl Mell’s road to Chicago', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Cheryl Mell’s'], 'GPE': ['Chicago']}}, {'sent': 'Shedd Aquarium seems almost preordained.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Shedd Aquarium']}}, {'sent': 'As a kid growing up in Morton Grove, Ill., she was never able to have the most common pets.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Morton Grove', 'Ill.']}}, {'sent': '“Both my sisters and my mother have allergies to dogs and cats,” she says, sitting in her office at the Shedd, where she is senior vice president for global field expeditions and conservation ambassador.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Shedd']}}, {'sent': 'Salt and Pepper, one white, one black.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'Mell went off to the University of Miami, where she received her bachelor of science degree in biology and marine science in 1989 and a master of science in education, biology and secondary education in 1991.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Mell', 'the University of Miami']}}, {'sent': 'In an interesting twist, while doing undergrad work she spent a lot of time on the Shedd’s research ship, the Coral Reef II, which the University of Miami leased.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Shedd', 'Reef II'], 'ORG': ['the University of Miami']}}, {'sent': '“I came back after grad school and stopped in Chicago to see family,” Mell says.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Chicago'], 'PERSON': ['Mell']}}, {'sent': '“On my bed was an ad, cut out of the paper, for an educator at the Shedd.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Shedd']}}, {'sent': 'She got the job and has been at the Shedd for 24 years.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Shedd']}}, {'sent': 'To bring the two together, it doesn’t get any better.”\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'During a recent visit in her office, Mell, 47, talked about her time at the Shedd and three of her favorite topics: conservation, education and travel.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Mell', 'Shedd'], 'CARDINAL': ['three']}}, {'sent': 'one of my focuses.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'I always say the Shedd was a good fit for me, and I was a good fit for the Shedd.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Shedd'], 'ORG': ['Shedd']}}, {'sent': 'Right now, we’re working with New Brunswick in Canada.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['New Brunswick', 'Canada']}}, {'sent': 'We love to take Shedd Aquarium members to these beautiful sites.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Shedd Aquarium']}}, {'sent': '(she met at a CSO concert), and she went on the Amazon trip.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Amazon']}}, {'sent': 'It’s to Cancun, and they will swim with whale sharks.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Cancun']}}, {'sent': 'They go to Cancun in the summer to feed on plankton.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Cancun'], 'GPE': ['plankton']}}, {'sent': 'Millennials want short trips, with a price point not to go over $1,800.', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['over $1,800']}}, {'sent': 'But they want Wi-Fi in their hotel, so they can brag to their friends.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Wi']}}, {'sent': 'You have been to seven continents and have seen some amazing things.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['seven']}}, {'sent': 'I have visited almost 100 countries.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['almost 100']}}, {'sent': 'The other place is the Peninsula Valdes, off the coast of Argentina.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Argentina']}}, {'sent': 'In August we’re going to Borneo.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Borneo']}}, {'sent': 'We’re partnering with Brookfield Zoo on this.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Brookfield Zoo']}}, {'sent': 'They have experts on orangutans;

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Two Hawaiian monk seal pups — a male and female — rescued from Laysan Island are now receiving care at Ke Kai Ola, the hospital run by The Marine Mammal Center in Kailua-Kona.

The newly weaned pups, ‘Akulikuli and Maiapilo, were suffering from malnutrition in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, according to Ke Kai Ola, but their Sept. 13 arrival was delayed due to Hurricane Olivia.

The Oscar Elton Sette, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s research vessel that rescued the seals, had to seek shelter at Pearl Harbor as the hurricane approached the islands and wait for the storm to pass before transporting the two monk seal pups to Hawaii island.

“Both of these pups have had quite a harrowing journey due to Hurricane Olivia before they arrived at the hospital,” said Ke Kai Ola hospital manager Claire Simeone in a news release. “We are grateful to have many partners who reacted quickly to handle this unique situation and give these pups a second chance at life.”

Both pups are now active and doing well, officials said.

They joined Sole and RK58, two male pups already undergoing rehabilitation at Ke Kai Ola since this summer.

‘Akulikuli, a male, had a few lacerations on his face and a small ulcer on the roof of his mouth. He weighs about 24 pounds lighter than his companion, Maiapilo, a female. Both are being fed a “fish-mash smoothie” three times a day to help them get vital nutrients.

Megan McGinnis, animal care manager at the Big Island facility, described ‘Akulikuli as small, but vocal, and Maiapilo as “feisty from the start.”

‘Akulikuli is named after an indigenous coastline plant, while Maiapilo is named after a plant native to Laysan Island.

Hawaiian monk seals are an endangered species, with an estimated population of about 1,400 remaining in the wild, officials say.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Federal officials are reminding the public to keep a good distance from a female monk seal that has hauled out at a Waikiki Beach for the fourth day on Wednesday.

The seal, identified as 8-year-old Kaiwi, has given birth to two pups previously in South or East Oahu, which are areas that she frequents.

While National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials do not believe Kaiwi, based on appearances, is pregnant this time, there is still a possibility that she is.

“This would be the time of year that she would give birth based on her previous puppings,” said NOAA marine mammal response coordinator Dave Schofield. “However, she’s not as large as we would expect to see her if she was giving birth at the beginning of May. Based on appearances, we’re feeling that she’s not pregnant.”

Still, since Hawaiian monk seals, an endangered species protected by both state and federal laws, typically forage at night and haul up to rest during the day, NOAA is reminding the public in a high traffic area such as Waikiki to give Kaiwi some space.

“There’s a lot going on in Waikiki, so any time a seal hauls up in a high human use area, we ask people to use precaution to keep the noise level to a minimum and to give a seal some space,” said Schofield.

NOAA asks that people not try to get a close-up selfie with the monk seal, and to stay behind protective borders that have been set up at a safe distance.

Volunteers from Hawaii Marine Animal Response, a non-profit that works with NOAA, have already set up a border around Kaiwi and are keeping an eye on her safety from sunup to sundown.

The year 2018 was a banner year for monk seal pups, with 30 pups born in the main Hawaiian isles.

While NOAA officials are not 100% sure if Kaiwi is expecting or not, they hope that if she is, she will give birth in a more remote location.

In 2017, Rocky the monk seal created a stir, giving birth to a pup at crowded Kaimana Beach in Waikiki. The pup kept swimming into the Natatorium nearby, and was eventually translocated after weaning to a more remote location away from crowds. Last year, NOAA officials breathed a sigh of relief when Rocky returned to her usual pupping location on Kauai to give birth to her pup.

“We’re all saying prayers,” said Schofield. “We want monk seals to give birth as much as possible but not in places where there’s lots of people.”";"Female monk seal returns to Waikiki; NOAA urges public to give her some space";https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zdGFyYWR2ZXJ0aXNlci5jb20vMjAxOS8wNS8wOC9oYXdhaWktbmV3cy9mZW1hbGUtbW9uay1zZWFsLXJldHVybnMtdG8td2Fpa2lraS1ub2FhLXVyZ2VzLXB1YmxpYy10by1naXZlLWhlci1zb21lLXNwYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/web1_WDA-MONK-SEAL-22.jpg;05/08/2019;[{'sent': 'Federal officials are reminding the public to keep a good distance from a female monk seal that has hauled out at a Waikiki Beach for the fourth day on Wednesday.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Waikiki Beach']}}, {'sent': 'The seal, identified as 8-year-old Kaiwi, has given birth to two pups previously in South or East Oahu, which are areas that she frequents.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Kaiwi'], 'CARDINAL': ['two'], 'GPE': ['East Oahu']}}, {'sent': 'While National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials do not believe Kaiwi, based on appearances, is pregnant this time, there is still a possibility that she is.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'], 'PERSON': ['Kaiwi']}}, {'sent': '“This would be the time of year that she would give birth based on her previous puppings,” said NOAA marine mammal response coordinator Dave Schofield.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Dave Schofield']}}, {'sent': 'Still, since Hawaiian monk seals, an endangered species protected by both state and federal laws, typically forage at night and haul up to rest during the day, NOAA is reminding the public in a high traffic area such as Waikiki to give Kaiwi some space.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Waikiki', 'NOAA'], 'PERSON': ['Kaiwi']}}, {'sent': '“There’s a lot going on in Waikiki, so any time a seal hauls up in a high human use area, we ask people to use precaution to keep the noise level to a minimum and to give a seal some space,” said Schofield.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Waikiki'], 'PERSON': ['Schofield']}}, {'sent': 'Volunteers from Hawaii Marine Animal Response, a non-profit that works with NOAA, have already set up a border around Kaiwi and are keeping an eye on her safety from sunup to sundown.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hawaii Marine Animal Response'], 'ORG': ['NOAA'], 'PERSON': ['Kaiwi']}}, {'sent': 'The year 2018 was a banner year for monk seal pups, with 30 pups born in the main Hawaiian isles.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['30']}}, {'sent': 'While NOAA officials are not 100% sure if Kaiwi is expecting or not, they hope that if she is, she will give birth in a more remote location.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['NOAA'], 'PERSON': ['Kaiwi']}}, {'sent': 'In 2017, Rocky the monk seal created a stir, giving birth to a pup at crowded Kaimana Beach in Waikiki.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Kaimana Beach'], 'ORG': ['Waikiki']}}, {'sent': 'Last year, NOAA officials breathed a sigh of relief when Rocky returned to her usual pupping location on Kauai to give birth to her pup.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Rocky', 'NOAA'], 'PERSON': ['Kauai']}}]
@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Federal officials had good news regarding critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals — the population in Hawaii appears to be holding steady due to recovery efforts.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported this month that the monk seal population in 2019 was about the same as in 2018, with slightly more than 1,400 seals, with approximately 1,100 in the Northwestern Hawaiian isles and 300 in the main Hawaiian isles.

“The 2019 results provide strong evidence that the number of seals in this region has been growing since at least 2013,” said NOAA Fishers. “Despite these positive signs, we must work to mitigate many human-associated threats to the main Hawaiian Islands monk seal population. These include Toxoplasma, fisheries interactions, and intentional killings.”

According to NOAA, a record high of 48 pups was born in the main Hawaiian isles last year, marking a particularly good reproductive year.

Interventions are also paying off.

Just last week, NOAA and The Marine Mammal Center successfully released RA20, one of a handful of seals that spends the majority of their time on Hawaii island, at Ooma Beach Park.

RA20 is an adult female monk seal, and mother to the last two pups born on Hawaii island. She is regularly seen near the Fairmont Orchid, but on Feb. 29 was displaying abnormal behavior that continued for several days.

A team rescued RA20 and brought her to TMMC’s Ke Kai Ola, a monk seal hospital in Kona, where veterinarians determined she had a bacterial infection. Upon further exam, veterinarians also suspected she may have recently lost a pregnancy.

Despite the good news in seal count, the report also found that fewer juvenile monk seals have survived at several of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands sites than in past years. On Oahu’s North Shore, drowning in fishing nets was the most likely cause of death for three juvenile seals in 2019.

Last year, two important seal pupping islets at French Frigate Shoals reappeared after being inundated or washed away by Hurricane Walaka in 2018, but still offer a limited area for seal pupping. Researchers translocated pups from the area to safer havens on higher ground.

In 2019, NOAA worked with partners to mitigate threats to monk seals with the following actions:

>> Disentangled marine debris from 12 seals in the NWHI, and two seals in the main Hawaiian isles.

>> Rescued five seals from entrapment or drowning in the human-made sea wall at Tern Island and French Frigate Shoals.

>> Removed fish hooks from 21 seals in the main Hawaiian Islands.

>> Sent six undersized seals — four from the NWHI, and two from the main isles – to Ke Kai Ola.

>> Translocated 14 pups from areas of high shark predation and nine seals from male seal aggression within atolls in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

>> Vaccinated seals against morbillivirus and treated infections with antibiotics.

>> Reunited moms and pups that had become separated.

Ke Kai Ola in Kona continues to care of Pohaku, or RO28, a female seal recovering from toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease spread through cat feces, as well as four seal pups rescued from Pearl and Hermes Atoll and Lisisanski Island last year.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"A critically ill Hawaiian monk seal has been rescued from Kauai for the second time and is now under the care of a monk seal hospital in Kailua-Kona.

RH38, a juvenile female monk seal, is in stable, but critical condition, according to Ke Kai Ola, a monk seal hospital run by The Marine Mammal Center. The center’s veterinary team conducted initial tests and found that RH38 is suffering from weakness, infection, broad-scale inflammation and malnutrition. However, the team is still trying to pinpoint the cause of these symptoms.

She has been provided with life-saving and supportive care, and the team continues to conduct extensive testing to find the cause of illness in the endangered monk seal. Most recently, she was transported to North Hawaii Community Hospital for a CT scan — the first ever performed on a wild Hawaiian monk seal.

“We’re incredibly concerned by RH38’s case as every individual is critical to this endangered population,” said Dr. Claire Simeone, the center’s hospital director, in a news release. “We are committed to finding the cause of her illness and are using world-class expertise and medical techniques to keep RH38 alive and get her back to the wild.”

Over the past year, the Kauai Hawaiian Monk Seal Conservation Hui has been monitoring RH38, and volunteers routinely observed her in good body condition. In March, however, her body condition rapidly grew worse.

She was rescued from Kauai on March 12 and transported by the U.S. Coast Guard to Ke Kai Ola.

The center said RH38 has been tested for dozens of diseases, toxins and parasites. Veterinarians have not found any evidence of toxoplasmosis, leptospirosis, morbillivirus, or influenza, trauma or poison, but are not ruling anything out at this point.

In August 2017, RH38 was also admitted to Ke Kai Ola for malnutrition and parasites. During three months of rehabilitation, she more than doubled her body weight and was successfully released back to the wild in Kauai.

Federal researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will continue to monitor the population of monk seals on Kauai, but so far, have found no indication that there is a threat to the larger population.

“No additional sick or malnourished monk seals have been detected across the main Hawaiian islands,” said Michelle Barbieri, a veterinarian with NOAA’s Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program, in a statement. “We do not currently have any reason to believe that what is affecting RH38 is contagious to the rest of the population.”

Since opening in 2014, Ke Kai Ola has rehabilitated 27 monk seals, most of which were rescued from and returned to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Hawaiian monk seals are a critically endangered species protected by state and federal laws. Only an estimated 1,400 remain in the wild.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The attorney for a man who slapped a Hawaiian monk seal while visiting Oahu several months ago has issued an apology on behalf of his client.

Attorney Blake Long of Barnwell & Long PLLC in North Carolina said the young man, who he advised to remain anonymous to avoid severe backlash, has paid fines from federal and state agencies in full for his violation of the Endangered Species Act. He did not disclose the amount paid.

Long said his client requested that he issue the apology “to express his sincere remorse for his immature, inexcusable actions.”

In February, officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Law Enforcement, as well as the state Division of Conservation and Resources Enforcement, began investigating an incident posted to TikTok, which showed a man approaching a monk seal from behind, leaning over, and then slapping it in the hindquarters.

The incident was also shared on other social media platforms, including Instagram.

“While this is an incident that my client wishes to leave behind, he is also hopeful that his mistake will be used as an example of the types of conduct tourists must avoid when encountering wildlife,” said the statement. “It is imperative that one maintains a respectful distance when observing all animals so as not to cause a disruption, potential harm or agitation to the animal or its environment.”

The statement continues: “The hope of my client and of the law enforcement officers involved in this matter is that my client’s brief lapse of judgment serves as a lesson that ultimately aids in the protection of both the indigenous species of Hawaii and those who are fortunate enough to observe them personally. To all who were dismayed at my client’s actions, please accept this apology expressing my client’s utmost regret and learn from his example as to the respect and care that must be afforded to wildlife not only in Hawaii, but across the world.”

NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement responded with its own statement, warning that more seals may actually be resting on Hawaii shorelines due to the “stay-at-home” orders during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Hawaiian Monk seals are endangered species and are protected by state and federal law,” said NOAA. “Harassing a protected species has serious consequences. This is a friendly reminder for our ocean users that the animals do frequent beaches to rest and with less beach traffic, you are seeing more animals come ashore to rest and sun themselves.”

In its viewing guidelines for marine wildlife in Hawaii, NOAA recommends staying at least 50 feet away from Hawaiian monk seals.

“There is no need to get close — your sudden movements may cause them to either flush into the water, or charge you,” said NOAA. “It is best to view them from afar. Use binoculars or your camera’s zoom lens for a close up photo.”

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Wildlife officials have determined that R028, a sick female Hawaiian monk seal under its care, is suffering from toxoplasmosis.

Following test results, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials determined that R028, also known as Pohaku, is suffering from the parasitic infection often spread into the environment via feral cat feces.

“Despite aggressive treatment, she is very lethargic, a sign that the infection is causing pain and severe inflammation throughout her internal organs,” said NOAA in the latest update on its website.

Officials picked up Pohaku from Ko Olina, and brought her to NOAA’s headquarters on Jan. 22 for monitoring after reports that she was “logging,” or lethargically floating on the water, a sign of possible illness.

“Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by infection with Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that reproduces in the digestive system of cats and spreads oocysts (eggs) into the environment via cat feces,” said NOAA officials in the post. “Feral cats, of which there are an estimated 50,000 to 300,000 on the island of Oahu alone, are the primary source of T. gondii oocysts in Hawaii.”

Hawaiian monk seals are exposed to these oocysts when they consume contaminated prey or water.

The parasite destroys vital tissues, such as muscle, liver, heart and brain tissues, officials said, which can lead to organ failure. Unfortunately, there is currently no vaccine for toxoplasmosis, and treatment options for infected seals are extremely limited.

So far, Pohaku has done better than most monk seals with toxoplasmosis, who are often found dead without warning. Two seals that were rescued prior to death succumbed to the disease within 48 hours.

“However, we are very guarded in our optimism,” NOAA officials said. “RO28’s prognosis is still poor given the aggressive nature of this disease and RO28’s lethargic condition in intensive care.”

To date, 11 Hawaiian monk seals are known to have died as a direct result of toxoplasmosis, but the number is likely higher due to unreported cases. Toxoplasmosis also affects other marine animals, including spinner dolphins and native birds, including alala, or Hawaiian crows.

NOAA officials say the public can help reduce the transmission of toxoplasmosis by keeping pet cats indoors, and making them indoor cats.

NOAA was also sad to report that RKC1, a juvenile, male monk seal also known as Sole, was found dead in Laie on Oahu the afternoon of Jan. 26. In 2018, Sole was rescued as a prematurely weaned pup on Molokai, and successfully rehabilitated at The Marine Mammal Center’s Ke Kai Ola in Kona.

He was released back into the wild near his birth site on Molokai, and sighted on Oahu shortly afterwards, but had only been seen a handful of times since them. The cause of his death is still being determined through a postmorten examination.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Could a Hawaiian monk seal mom have given birth to twin pups at Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument this year?

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers believe this is a possibility after observing Hawaiian monk seal mom, GV18, nursing two similarly sized pups at Lisianski Island.

The researchers have been at Papahanaumokuakea since May, where they spend five months at field camps, measuring and tagging seal pups, monitoring sea turtles and cleaning up marine debris, along with other tasks.

While monk seal moms occasionally adopt a second pup, says NOAA, this usually lasts for a short period of time. Either the mom or larger pup will drive the adopted pup away. In this case, researchers have not found other seal mothers missing a pup.

GV18, a 14-year-old Hawaiian monk seal mom, nursed both pups together and weaned them at a slightly smaller than normal size.

The birth of twin monk seal pups is extremely rare, according to NOAA.

A previous review of nearly 5,000 monk seal births over a 26-year period between 1983 and 2008 revealed only seven sets of twin pups. Thus, monk seal twinning occurs in only 0.1%of all births. A DNA analysis on these sets of twin pups confirmed they were all fraternal, not identical, twins.

This year’s “twins” are not identical, either, as one pup is a girl and the other a boy.

Researchers tagging weaned pups at Papahanaumokuakea also collect snips of tissue that hold the key to each seal’s genetic makeup. Researchers are eagerly awaiting DNA results from these snips of tissue to confirm whether these pups are indeed twins.

Researchers also noted another maternal milestone at Lisianski Island. A 29-year-old Hawaiian monk seal, TG28, gave birth to her 17th pup this year. She is one of the oldest monk seal moms to have given birth at a late age. The oldest monk seal mom on record is 32 years old.

Hawaiian monk seals are a critically endangered species protected by state and federal laws. Only an estimated 1,400 Hawaiian monk seals remain in the wild, with roughly 1,100 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands at Papahanaumokuakea, one of the largest, protected marine conservation areas in the world.";Rare twin Hawaiian monk seal pups likely seen at Lisianski Island;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS8yMDE5LzA4LzMwL2hhd2FpaS1uZXdzL3JhcmUtdHdpbi1oYXdhaWlhbi1tb25rLXNlYWwtcHVwcy1saWtlbHktc2Vlbi1hdC1saXNpYW5za2ktaXNsYW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/web1_1280_A5YR6SvYTU78.jpg;08/30/2019;[{'sent': 'Could a Hawaiian monk seal mom have given birth to twin pups at Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument this year?\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument']}}, {'sent': 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration', 'ents': {'ORG': ['National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration']}}, {'sent': 'researchers believe this is a possibility after observing Hawaiian monk seal mom, GV18, nursing two similarly sized pups at Lisianski Island.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['GV18'], 'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'The researchers have been at Papahanaumokuakea since May, where they spend five months at field camps, measuring and tagging seal pups, monitoring sea turtles and cleaning up marine debris, along with other tasks.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Papahanaumokuakea', 'marine debris']}}, {'sent': 'While monk seal moms occasionally adopt a second pup, says NOAA, this usually lasts for a short period of time.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['NOAA']}}, {'sent': 'GV18, a 14-year-old Hawaiian monk seal mom, nursed both pups together and weaned them at a slightly smaller than normal size.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['GV18']}}, {'sent': 'The birth of twin monk seal pups is extremely rare, according to NOAA.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['NOAA']}}, {'sent': 'A previous review of nearly 5,000 monk seal births over a 26-year period between 1983 and 2008 revealed only seven sets of twin pups.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['nearly 5,000', 'only seven']}}, {'sent': 'Researchers tagging weaned pups at Papahanaumokuakea also collect snips of tissue that hold the key to each seal’s genetic makeup.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Papahanaumokuakea']}}, {'sent': 'A 29-year-old Hawaiian monk seal, TG28, gave birth to her 17th pup this year.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['TG28']}}, {'sent': 'Only an estimated 1,400 Hawaiian monk seals remain in the wild, with roughly 1,100 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands at Papahanaumokuakea, one of the largest, protected marine conservation areas in the world.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Only an estimated 1,400', 'roughly 1,100'], 'GPE': ['Papahanaumokuakea']}}]
@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The “stay-at-home” orders in place due to the coronavirus pandemic have benefited some non-human species – specifically, Hawaiian monk seals.

Monk seal researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said this year is off to a good start for Hawaiian monk seal pups in the main Hawaiian islands.

Due to various beach park closures, the critically endangered monk seals have been able to rest without as much disturbance from humans, allowing moms to nurse and rear their pups in peace.

“Because people have less access to the beach, there has been less potential for interaction, which happens when people are on the beach in large numbers,” said David Schofield, NOAA stranding coordinator. “If people are using the beaches the way they’re supposed to, moving through and swimming and surfing then we perceive there will be less interaction between the public and marine wildlife.”

To date, nine monk seal pups have been born in the main Hawaiian islands since the start of 2020 — four on Oahu, three on Molokai, and one each on Kauai and Hawaii island. A monk seal pup was just born on Molokai over the weekend, according to Schofield.

NOAA does not disclose the locations of pups to protect them.

In 2019, 25 pups were born in the main Hawaiian islands, and in 2018, which was a record year, 31 pups were born in the main Hawaiian islands.

The most notorious monk seal pup birth took place at Kaimana Beach in Waikiki in 2018.

Rocky, a monk seal well-known for giving birth on Kauai, for some reason chose Kaimana Beach in Waikiki as a place to give birth to a female pup, which was eventually nicknamed Kaimana.

While it delighted visitors in Waikiki, and increased awareness worldwide about the endangered monk seals, and how important it is to give a monk seal mom some space, NOAA officials fretted over the safety of the pup, which kept swimming in the dilapidated Natatorium swimming pool.

When the pup weaned, NOAA officials decided to transport the pup to a more remote location on Oahu’s North Shore, where it could continue to develop away from crowds of humans.

Generally, moms rear their pups for five to seven weeks, nursing them until they grow from about 30 pounds to nearly 200 pounds from fatty milk. During this time, the monk seal mom loses a great amount of body weight, and abruptly weans the pup in order to return to sea and forage.

The pup lives off of its body fat for several weeks, then begins to forage for fish itself.

Although there are fewer people on the beach, NOAA reminds the public to remain a respectful distance from marine animals, including monk seals and turtles, and would appreciate it if residents reminded others to do so as well.

“It’s a marvelous thing to come upon a monk seal mom and pup,” said Schofield. “It’s such a treasure to have the monk seal in Hawaii. People who use the beaches know how precious the wildlife is, but some may not.”

In its viewing guidelines for marine wildlife, NOAA has come up with the “rule of thumb” to determine how far to remain from a monk seal. The viewer makes a “thumbs up” gesture and extends their arm straight out in front, then turns the thumb parallel to the ground in their line of sight of the seal. If the thumb covers the entire seal, then the viewer is far enough – approximately 50 feet — away.

For Hawaiian monk seal moms and pups, the nonprofit Hawaii Marine Animal Response recommends staying at least 150 feet away.

The Hawaiian monk seal is a critically endangered species protected by both state and federal laws. Today, slightly more than 1,400 monk seals remain in the wild, with roughly 1,100 residing in the Northwestern Hawaii islands.

A growing number of pups, however, are being born in the main Hawaiian Islands, where they are at risk of entanglement with fishing gear and susceptible to toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by a parasite that reproduces in the digestive system of cats.

On April 1, a well-known Hawaiian monk seal mom, Pohaku, succumbed to toxoplasmosis following weeks of battling the disease, and after officials had rescued her from waters near Ko Olina.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The year 2018 has been a record one for Hawaiian monk seal pups born in the main Hawaiian isles, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While no monk seal moms gave birth in Waikiki, as Rocky did last year, creating a stir among beachgoers and generating attention worldwide, it was a good year for pups.

As of Nov. 2 of this year, 30 pups had been born in the main Hawaiian islands, soundly beating the previous record of 21 pups in 2013, NOAA Fisheries said.

In addition, eight of this year’s pups were born to first-time moms, including one born to new mom R8HE in Maui County.

“We know some folks get really excited about new seal pups and want to go see them in person — we do too!” said NOAA Fisheries in an online post. “But too many visitors can unintentionally disrupt resting and nursing. That’s why we usually refrain from publicizing specific pup locations and we ask that you do the same. By not specifying pup locations in our social media posts, we can help keep disturbance to a minimum.”

Rocky gave birth again this year, but on Kauai. Her pup, RK58, is now gaining weight at Ke Kai Ola, the monk seal hospital run by The Marine Mammal Center in Kailua-Kona, following a mom-pup switch. Another monk seal pup, Sole, was born at Kalaupapa, and taken to Ke Kai Ola, as well, following a mom-pup switch. Sole has since been released back into the wild.

Hawaiian monk seals are a critically endangered species found only in Hawaii protected by both federal and state laws. Only an estimated 1,400 monk seals remain in the wild, according to NOAA Fisheries, with about 1,100 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, and 300 in the main Hawaiian islands.

The public is advised to stay quiet and enjoy Hawaiian monk seal moms and pups from a distance, behind signs or barriers that may be present.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Within 24 hours of Gov. David Ige announcing the state’s shelter-in-place order, the Hawaii Humane Society had a 250-person waiting list for cat fosters hoping to cope with loneliness, anxiety and boredom from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cat fosters are up 65% compared to this time last year, said Daniel Roselle, director of community relations for the Hawaii Humane Society.

While a pet cat can ease stress in humans, the animal can take a huge toll on Hawaii’s environment. The latest episode of our podcast “Are We Doomed? And Other Burning Environmental Questions,” has tips on how to protect Hawaii’s environment from cats, even if you don’t own one.

Claire Caulfield/Civil Beat

The Hawaii Humane Society is expecting a boom in the feral cat population post-pandemic. During the 2008 financial crisis, pet abandonment was common and Roselle said shelters in the state have already seen people surrendering their pets.

“We’re preparing for a lot of people coming to our pet food banks because on a reduced or cut income they won’t be able to feed their pets,” said Roselle, who noted that the Humane Society gave away over 6,000 pounds of pet food in April.

Roselle said donating food or money to a local shelter or pet food bank can help someone keep their cat, and protect native animals from hungry cats.

The growing feral cat populations in Hawaii are a bigger issue, Roselle said. Most of the Humane Society’s spay and neuter efforts are paused to insure veterinarians can practice social distancing.

“That is probably the most challenging thing for us to accept,” he said. “We know it’ll have an impact later.”

Cats are an invasive species, and pose unique risks to native birds and reptiles in Hawaii that evolved without feline predators. Cats have contributed to the extinction of at least 33 native island species and are the main threat to dozens of endangered birds, mammals and reptiles.

And cats are indirectly killing species that don’t even live on land, like the endangered Hawaiian monk seal.

Anthony Quintano/Civil Beat

There are only about 1,400 monk seals in the world, and a parasite from cat poop is the leading cause of death for seals who call the main Hawaiian islands home, Cara Field, medical director for the Marine Mammal Center, said.

“Other marine mammals definitely can catch it,” Field said. “Some whales, dolphins mostly … so this is not just a problem for monk seals.”

A parasite called toxoplasma gondii is found in a lot of cats. Unlike other mammals, cats are rarely sickened by the parasite, but the cat’s digestive tract does provide the perfect environment for the parasite to reproduce.

“At this point, there’s no other animal that we know that can spread it,” Field said.

If a cat is pooping outdoors, thousands of these parasites can make their way into streams, rivers and the ocean — infecting any mammals along the way.

And it’s not just feral cats causing problems. Pet cats that are allowed to roam outdoors also spread toxoplasma gondii and kill endangered wildlife.

A recent study found free-roaming pet cats can impact local ecosystems four to ten times more than a natural predator. Because domesticated cats often stick close to home, their territory is much smaller than a wild predator and therefore the cat has an outsized impact.

Claire Caulfield/Civil Beat

“This is not about blaming cats because I love my cats,” Field said. She built her pets an enclosed patio, or “cat-io,” so they could enjoy the fresh air without hurting the environment.

“Building yourself a cat-io would actually be a good project if you’re bored at home,” she said.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Two Hawaiian monk seals are back home on Laysan Island at Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument after more than six months of growth and rehabilitation at an animal hospital in Kailua-Kona.

Maiapilo, a female, and ‘Akulikuli, a male, are both doing well back at Papahanaumokuakea, where they were first discovered as prematurely weaned pups.

Both seals were fitted with new satellite tags to help researchers monitor them post-release. Maiapilo has been traveling around the atoll, while ‘Akulikuli has stayed near shore.

Kai Kai Ola, The Marine Mammal Center’s monk seal hospital in Kailua-Kona, works with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers to find malnourished pups and rehabilitate them before returning them to the wild.

“Both Maiapilo and ‘Akulikuli were prematurely weaned pups that would have died without intervention,” said Claire Simeone, Ke Kai Ola’s hospital director. “For endangered species in particular, every individual is critical so we are thrilled that they have learned the skills needed to successfully forage and have a second chance at life to help boost the monk seal population.”

Maiapilo and ‘Akulikuli were picked up last September and returned to Laysan aboard NOAA’s research vessel, the Oscar Elton Sette, which sets out on an expedition to Papahanaumokuakea every spring so researchers can monitor wildlife and clean marine debris.

Both seals have been frequently sighted by field campers stationed on Laysan Island.

At Ke Kai Ola, Maiapilo gained a remarkable 220 pounds, while ‘Akulikuli, who was also treated for a mouth ulcer and facial lacerations, gained more than 125 pounds.

Since opening in 2014, Ke Kai Ola has rehabilitated 27 monk seals.

Another monk seal from Kauai, RH38, remains in rehabilitation at Ke Kai Ola. She was diagnosed in late April with muscle damage due to an unknown trauma, which led to widespread infection and organ damage. RH38 recently began molting, said Ke Kai Ola, an important sign that her body condition is improving and resuming natural functions.

Hawaiian monk seals are a critically endangered species protected by federal and state laws, with an estimated population of 1,400 remaining in the wild. While most reside at Papahanaumokuakea, a growing number are giving birth to pups in the main Hawaiian islands. The public is advised to enjoy Hawaiian monk seals from a distance, particularly moms and pups.

Sightings of monk seals on Hawaii island can be reported to the center’s response team at 987-0765.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Thanks to a conscientious fisherman, a Hawaiian monk seal no longer has a hook, line and sinker in his stomach, and is doing well back in the wild.

Officials from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration were able to locate RW02, an 11-year-old, male monk seal, and remove the contents from his stomach using endoscope technology.

NOAA released RW02, also known by the nickname of “Kauai Kolohe,” back into the ocean at Mokuleia on Oahu’s North Shore over the weekend.

“We’re really excited today to tell you the happy ending of a monk seal story that could have gone really bad, but it went really well,” said David Schofield, NOAA’s stranding coordinator. “This poor monk seal really did swallow a fish hook, fishing line and a sinker, but with the quick action of the community and the experts at the NOAA Fisheries Service, we were able to remove that material and release the seal back to the wild.”

The fisherman, who preferred to remain anonymous, reported the hooking on June 23, and NOAA is thanking him for it because as a result, the team was able to take swift action and help RW02 within the next two weeks.

“We really applaud the fishermen and fishing community who wants to work with NOAA on helping to protect the wildlife, the sea turtles, the whales, dolphins and seals,” said Schofield.

He emphasized that fisherman and other members of the public should call any time a seal is hooked or sighted with fishing line coming out of its mouth.

“We want people to call,” said Schofield. “We’re going to get out there and help the seal and there’s no reason not to call us. We want to partner with the fishing community on these types of things. And we understand that accidents happen.”

Dr. Michelle Barbieri, NOAA’s veterinarian, said an endoscope — a flexible, fiber-optic tube with a camera attached at the end — is typically used to plan a surgery, which is much more invasive and requires more recovery time. Fortunately, the team was able to use the endoscope and snare to remove the hook. As a result, the team was able to release RW02 the next day.

NOAA first discovered RW02 as a very young seal on Kauai in 2008, and is familiar with him, having attached a satellite tag to track him previously. In 2013, he began hanging out mostly on Oahu.

Volunteers from Hawaii Marine Animal Response helped locate RW02, and have since spotted him at Mokuleia, doing well.

Hawaiian monk seals are a critically endangered species protected by state and federal laws. Only an estimated 1,400 Hawaiian monk seals remain in the wild.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Two years ago, Jerry Schubel, president and CEO of the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, told me, “If you want your kids to care about the ocean, get them to care about the things that live in the ocean.” He invited my four children (ages twelve, nine, four, and one at the time) to the aquarium for a day of petting sharks, feeding sea otters and manta rays, enjoying the company of a precocious two-year-old Magellanic penguin, and shadowing staff as they identified and logged aquatic life sightings aboard Harbor Breeze Cruises.

On that cruise, we fell in love with a family of five fin whales swimming in the ocean. We could hear each whale breathe, and some of us got sprayed in the face by water from their blowholes. Today we still think about their well-being and what we can do to prevent threats to the second-largest species of whales.

Now, with shelter-in-place orders in effect, I wondered how aquariums and ocean-conservation programs would continue sharing these kinds of experiences remotely. Fortunately, the Aquarium of the Pacific and a number of other organizations throughout the country are offering families a variety of engaging activities online.

Aquariums

The Aquarium of the Pacific’s Online Academy includes programs with its educators, live webcams, YouTube videos, a guest-speaker series , and a daily show. “The interaction between us and the audience is key,” says David Bader, its director of education. “We are trying to use face-to-face teaching theories in a distance-learning platform. We are building connections and community among our viewers. We want people of all ages who are at home to engage with our exhibits and animals and learn about the ocean.”

The aquarium’s free Pacific Visions EcoAlliance app challenges both adults and kids to sustainably consume food, water, and energy. Lola the cockatoo’s field trip around the aquarium is an especially popular post.

Birch Aquarium is the public-outreach center for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego, one of the largest research programs for ocean and earth science. Tune in to its Facebook events and watch behind-the-scenes videos of things like hatching weedy sea dragons or a giant kelp-forest tank that is pumped with sea water, which facilitates the growth of algae.

Each week the Georgia Aquarium premieres a new video in its Deep Sea Learning YouTube series. Check out its new at-home learning program, which offers field guides and lesson plans for kindergarten through 12th grade. Its most popular posts feature puppies from the Atlanta Humane Society visiting the aquarium while it’s closed to the public.

In Hawaii, Waikiki Aquarium has set up new virtual experiences, like how to draw marine animals with Hawaiian nature artist Patrick Ching and webcams of the Hawaiian monk seal named Hoailona, the south shore of Waikiki, and the aquarium’s galleries.

“Engaging and inspiring the public about the wonders of our blue planet is central to our mission,” says Vikki N. Spruill, president and CEO of the New England Aquarium. To continue those efforts during the pandemic, her aquarium is hosting a new series of virtual visits, daily live educational presentations on Facebook at 11 A.M. EST, interviews with aquarists, and at-home projects. The most popular video since its closure has been the African penguin feeding.

Some unique opportunities have been made possible because aquariums are closed. From March 26 to April 14, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service granted Monterey Bay Aquarium in California a special exception to livestream what guests would normally not be allowed to see: resident sea otters taking care of stranded pups. Visit its Learning at Home page to find free self-paced online courses, such as Tidepool Scientist for pre-K to second grade and Explore Like a Scientist for grades three through six. “Our education team helps students to think like a scientist while they learn about ocean animals and habitats and what they can contribute to conservation,” says Rita Bell, its vice president of education.

Nonprofits and Government Agencies

The Pacific Marine Mammal Center, located in Laguna Beach, California, offers long-distance educational presentations that are normally only available to schools but are now open to everyone. Using the Seal Spotter app, participants can take photos of tagged seals or sea lions in the wild so the center can see where the animals they once took care of are and how they’re faring.

NOAA’s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries manages 14 national marine sanctuaries as well as the Papahanaumokuakea and Rose Atoll Marine National Monuments, located in the North and South Pacific Oceans, respectively. Start with Sanctuaries at Home for access to its interactive live webinar series, which includes videos like “Bringing the Ocean to You,” early releases of its virtual-reality dives, games, a curriculum, and expeditions.

The Ocean Film Festival, originally scheduled to run in March in San Francisco, has released its films for free online. Movies like Alice in Borneo’s Wonderland, about a 16-year-old learning to scuba-dive, were added for middle school and high school students who were set to attend the festival. “Some of these kids have never been to the ocean. Our goal is to bring the ocean to our audiences, since they can’t come to us,” says executive director Ann Blanco. “Our desire is to keep the conversation going, so we can learn about the beauty of our ocean, the amazing animals that live in the ocean, and how we recreate with the ocean for our pleasure. The ocean brings us calm and reduces our stress, so we’re trying to help during this critical time with the power of film.”

Although virtual experiences provide similar benefits to reality, we had such a fantastic once-in-a-lifetime experience with the whales that I wasn’t sure how virtual programs could compare. But after a week of introducing these resources to my family, I noticed that my older kids would sometimes skip Fortnite meetups just to attend underwater livestreams. After working my way through the Aquarium of the Pacific’s lecture series Ocean to Table: Stories of Food, Farming, and Conservation, I now serve my family only seafood from sustainable and responsible wild and farmed sources, and I make smoothies with seaweed. And while watching the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s sea otter cam and listening to its social-media team answer questions about stranded pups one day, my six-year-old giggled at the sight of Ivy, a resident sea otter, pouncing on the back of a pup, wrapping her arms around the pup’s waist, and wrangling her down to a sleeping position. “Mom, that’s what you do with us,” my daughter said. My three-year-old asked me to scratch her belly the way Ivy was calming down her pup. Then she pointed at the pup and said, “She looks just like me.”";Ocean Nerds, Check Out These Online Experiences;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEIZtMaPKhWQaItqrBZbyDQkqFggEKg0IACoGCAow2IsBMIAdMPGRrwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/full-page/public/2020/04/21/penguin-webcam-pacific_h.jpg?itok=o0J29pG3;04/27/2020;[{'sent': 'Two years ago, Jerry Schubel, president and CEO of the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, told me, “If you want your kids to care about the ocean, get them to care about the things that live in the ocean.”', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jerry Schubel'], 'ORG': ['the Aquarium of the Pacific in'], 'GPE': ['California', 'Long Beach']}}, {'sent': 'He invited my four children (ages twelve, nine, four, and one at the time) to the aquarium for a day of petting sharks, feeding sea otters and manta rays, enjoying the company of a precocious two-year-old Magellanic penguin, and shadowing staff as they identified and logged aquatic life sightings aboard Harbor Breeze Cruises.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['nine', 'four']}}, {'sent': 'On that cruise, we fell in love with a family of five fin whales swimming in the ocean.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['five']}}, {'sent': 'The Aquarium of the Pacific’s Online Academy includes programs with its educators, live webcams, YouTube videos, a guest-speaker series , and a daily show.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Online Academy']}}, {'sent': '“The interaction between us and the audience is key,” says David Bader, its director of education.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['David Bader']}}, {'sent': 'The aquarium’s free Pacific Visions EcoAlliance app challenges both adults and kids to sustainably consume food, water, and energy.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Pacific Visions EcoAlliance']}}, {'sent': 'Lola the cockatoo’s field trip around the aquarium is an especially popular post.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Lola']}}, {'sent': 'Birch Aquarium is the public-outreach center for the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California at San Diego, one of the largest research programs for ocean and earth science.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the University of California at San Diego', 'the Scripps Institution of Oceanography', 'Birch Aquarium'], 'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'Each week the Georgia Aquarium premieres a new video in its Deep Sea Learning YouTube series.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Georgia Aquarium']}}, {'sent': 'Its most popular posts feature puppies from the Atlanta Humane Society visiting the aquarium while it’s closed to the public.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Atlanta Humane Society']}}, {'sent': 'In Hawaii, Waikiki Aquarium has set up new virtual experiences, like how to draw marine animals with Hawaiian nature artist Patrick Ching and webcams of the Hawaiian monk seal named Hoailona, the south shore of Waikiki, and the aquarium’s galleries.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hawaii'], 'ORG': ['Waikiki Aquarium', 'Waikiki'], 'PERSON': ['Hoailona', 'Patrick Ching']}}, {'sent': '“Engaging and inspiring the public about the wonders of our blue planet is central to our mission,” says Vikki N.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Federal wildlife officials have captured an adult female Hawaiian monk seal for monitoring after it was showing sick-like behavior in the Ko Olina area.

Seal RO28, also known as Pohaku, is being cared for by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries veterinary staff, NOAA Fisheries said on its website. Pohaku was captured Wednesday after a volunteer saw her exhibiting a behavior called “logging,” in which a seal will lethargically float on the water and not swim.

NOAA said “logging” can indicate a seal is injured or has underlying health problems.

Some seals, including Pohaku, can show this behavior for several hours even while appearing healthy. However, after monitoring Pohaku, NOAA staff decided to bring her in for further evaluation.

NOAA will provide an update on her condition when test results come back.

Monk seals are a critically endangered species with about 1,400 in the wild, living around the Northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands. The seals are endemic to Hawaii.

Meanwhile, NOAA reported earlier this month that a young monk seal that died in November may have drowned in a lay gillnet. RL36, also known as Makoa, was found dead on Oahu’s North Shore on Nov. 9.

Tests showed Makoa had been healthy and had no underlying disease, and photos taken before his death showed he appeared normal.

With the available information and similarities with other monk seal drownings, experts said the evidence points to drowning as the cause of Makoa’s death.

However, because of decomposition, researchers could not completely rule out trauma.

NOAA urged the public to follow these guidelines for fishing around seals and turtles.";NOAA captures monk seal that was acting ill;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS8yMDIwLzAxLzI0L2hhd2FpaS1uZXdzL25ld3N3YXRjaC9ub2FhLWNhcHR1cmVzLW1vbmstc2VhbC10aGF0LXdhcy1hY3RpbmctaWxsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_1280_IsYF7nTlb3L2.jpg;01/25/2020;[{'sent': 'Federal wildlife officials have captured an adult female Hawaiian monk seal for monitoring after it was showing sick-like behavior in the Ko Olina area.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Ko Olina']}}, {'sent': 'Seal RO28, also known as Pohaku, is being cared for by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries veterinary staff, NOAA Fisheries said on its website.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Pohaku'], 'ORG': ['NOAA Fisheries', 'National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries']}}, {'sent': 'Pohaku was captured Wednesday after a volunteer saw her exhibiting a behavior called “logging,” in which a seal will lethargically float on the water and not swim.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Pohaku']}}, {'sent': 'NOAA said “logging” can indicate a seal is injured or has underlying health problems.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['NOAA']}}, {'sent': 'Some seals, including Pohaku, can show this behavior for several hours even while appearing healthy.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Pohaku']}}, {'sent': 'However, after monitoring Pohaku, NOAA staff decided to bring her in for further evaluation.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Pohaku'], 'ORG': ['NOAA']}}, {'sent': 'Monk seals are a critically endangered species with about 1,400 in the wild, living around the Northwestern and main Hawaiian Islands.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['about 1,400']}}, {'sent': 'The seals are endemic to Hawaii.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hawaii']}}, {'sent': 'Meanwhile, NOAA reported earlier this month that a young monk seal that died in November may have drowned in a lay gillnet.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['NOAA']}}, {'sent': 'RL36, also known as Makoa, was found dead on Oahu’s North Shore on Nov. 9.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Makoa'], 'PERSON': ['Oahu']}}, {'sent': 'Tests showed Makoa had been healthy and had no underlying disease, and photos taken before his death showed he appeared normal.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Makoa']}}]
@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Hawaiian monk seal RH38 is one very lucky pinniped.

The juvenile female seal that was rescued in a critically ill state in March, was recently released back to the wild on Kauai, according to Ke Kai Ola, the monk seal hospital in Kailua-Kona run by the Marine Mammal Center. She was released in good health with a tracking tag attached to her back, and appears to be doing well.

It is her second time being rehabilitated and released from Ke Kai Ola in the past two years.

“For an endangered marine mammal like the Hawaiian monk seal, the release of every individual is critical to help boost the overall population,” says Dr. Shawn Johnson, the center’s Vice President of Veterinary Medicine and Science, in a news release. “RH38’s recovery is an incredible success story that was full of medical complexities and highlights the importance of our ongoing partnerships to help save this species.”

The first time RH38 was admitted to Ke Kai Ola in August 2017, she was treated for malnutrition and a heavy parasite load.

During this second round, RH38 was treated for a slew of serious medical ailments including trauma, pneumonia, corneal damage and multiple organ infections due to sepsis.

While providing her with care, the center was trying to pinpoint the cause of her symptoms, which included weakness, broad-scale inflammation and malnutrition. So in April, she became the first seal to undergo a CT scan at North Hawaii Community Hospital.

The scan found that an infection in the seal’s back flippers, believed to have been caused by some sort of trauma, had spread to her bloodstream, causing a wide range of other problems.

RH38’s story highlights the seriousness of threats to this endangered species in the wild. Only an estimated 1,400 Hawaiian monk seals — a critically endangered species protected by state and federal laws – remain in the wild.

The center partners with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to provide care for ill or malnourished monk seals, and has rehabilitated and released 28 (which includes RH38 twice) since opening Ke Kai Ola in 2014. NOAA estimates about 30% of monk seals are alive today due to conservation efforts.

Shortly following RH38’s release in late July, Ke Kai Ola took in a seriously ill female pup from Kalaupapa, Molokai, with help from the U.S. Coast Guard.

The weaned seal pup, RL76, was observed with severe head swelling, and was displaying open mouth breathing behavior.

Radiograph and ultrasound exams showed the pup was suffering from head trauma, scratches and puncture wounds consistent with an interaction with another seal. Veterinary experts are watching her closely, and will consider the next steps to take once her trauma and respiration improves.

NOAA reminds the public to remain a safe distance from monk seals.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The mystery began about two years ago, when Charles Littnan, lead scientist of the monk-seal program, got a strange email from researchers in the field. The subject line was short: ""Eel in nose.""

A relaxed-looking juvenile Hawaiian monk seal lounges near a sandy white beach on some green foliage. Its eyes are half-closed and it has a serene expression on its face. But the seal’s calm demeanor is surprising.

Why? Well, there’s a long, black-and-white eel dangling from its right nostril.

“It’s just so shocking,” Claire Simeone, a veterinarian and monk-seal expert based in Hawaii, told The Washington Post. “It’s an animal that has another animal stuck up its nose.”

Simeone wasn’t the only person stunned by the photo of the seal and its unusual facial ornament that was shared last week on Facebook by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program. The picture — taken this year in the remote northwestern Hawaiian islands

— went viral, drawing attention to a rare phenomenon that continues to baffle scientists who wish the endangered seals would “make better choices.”

It began about two years ago, when Charles Littnan, lead scientist of the monk-seal program, woke up to a strange email from researchers in the field. The subject line was short: “Eel in nose.”

“It was just like, ‘We found a seal with an eel stuck in its nose, do we have a protocol?'” Littnan said in a phone interview.

There was none, Littnan said, and it took several emails and phone calls before the decision was made to grab the eel and try pulling it out.

“There was only maybe two inches of the eel actually still sticking out of the nose, so it was very much akin to the magician’s trick when they’re pulling out the handkerchiefs and they keep coming and coming and coming,” he said.

After less than a minute of tugging, a 2 1/2-foot dead eel emerged from the seal’s nostril.

Since then, Littnan said there have been at least three or four reported cases, the most recent occurring this fall. In all the cases, the eels were removed successfully and the seals are “doing great,” he said. None of the eels, however, survived.

“We have no idea why this is suddenly happening,” Littnan said. “You see some very strange things if you watch nature long enough, and this could end up being one of these little oddities and mysteries of our careers that 40 years from now, we’ll be retired and still questioning quite how this happened.”

Researchers have already determined this is not the result of a human with a personal vendetta against seals and eels because all the cases were reported from remote islands that are only frequented by scientists. Littnan said he does have a few theories about how an eel could naturally end up wedged in a seal’s nostril.

A seal’s preferred prey — usually fish, octopuses and, of course, eels — like to hide within coral reefs to avoid being eaten, and since the marine mammals don’t have hands, they have to hunt with their faces.

“They like to stick their faces into the coral reef holes and they’ll spit water out of their mouths to flush things out and they’ll do all sorts of tricks, but they are shoving their faces into holes,” Littnan said.

Perhaps, he said, a cornered eel decided that the only way to escape or defend itself was to swim up its attacker’s nostril and young seals that are “not very adept at getting their food yet” were forced to learn a tough lesson.

But Littnan admitted that theory doesn’t make much sense.

“They’re really quite long eels, and their diameter is probably close to what it would be for a nasal passage,” he said.

He added that a monk seal’s nostrils, which reflexively close when they are diving for food, are very muscular and it would be difficult for any animal to push through.

“I struggle to think of an eel really wanting to force its way into a nose,” he said.

The other way eels might be ending up in nostrils is through throwing up. Similar to how people sometimes end up accidentally spewing food or beverages from their noses, that could also happen to seals, who often regurgitate their meals.

Still, Littnan said it doesn’t seem possible that a “long, fat eel” would end up going through a seal’s nose rather than out of its mouth. The “most plausible” theory, he said, is that monk seal teenagers aren’t all that different from their human counterparts. Monk seals “seem naturally attracted to getting into troublesome situations,” Littnan said.

“It almost does feel like one of those teenage trends that happen,” he said. “One juvenile seal did this very stupid thing and now the others are trying to mimic it.”

Though no seals have died or been seriously affected by the eels, having a dead animal up their noses for any extended time poses potentially adverse health impacts, said Simeone, director of Ke Kai Ola, a monk-seal hospital in Hawaii run by the Marine Mammal Center.

With an eel lodged in its nose, a monk seal would not be able to close the blocked nostril when diving, which means water could get into its lungs and cause problems, such as pneumonia, Simeone said. A decomposing eel carcass could also lead to infections, she said.

Littnan said the young seal “seemed apparently fairly oblivious to the fact that there was two feet of eel sticking out of its face.”

In general, Simeone said marine animals are “very stoic,” adding, “It’s amazing the kinds of things they can tolerate.”

While “eel snorting” has yet to catch on in the seal community, Littnan said he hopes it never does.

“We’re hoping it’s just one of these flukes that will disappear and never be seen again,” he said.

If monk seals could understand humans, Littnan said he has a message for them: “I would gently plead for them to stop.”";"Endangered Hawaiian monk seals keep getting eels stuck up their noses;

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Another Hawaiian monk seal accidentally hooked by a fisherman has been rescued, treated and released, according to federal wildlife officials.

Hawaiian monk seal R333 is alive and well, and already back in the ocean, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials, thanks to a fisherman who did the right thing.

“One of the heroes in this story is the fisherman who reported the seal hooking,” said David Schofield, NOAA regional marine mammal response coordinator. “His timely reporting as well as telling us the gear types, and what experience he had with the seal as far as reeling it in and cutting the line helped to inform the response and treatment to the seal. So it’s a very happy story in that regard.”

R333, an adult male, was accidentally hooked on the morning of Saturday, July 27, at Kaena Point on Oahu’s North Shore.

The fisherman called NOAA’s hotline right away, according to Schofield, and volunteers from Hawaii Marine Animal Response were able to locate the seal that same day. They found him with line coming out of his mouth.

NOAA officials caught R333 the next day and brought him in to remove the hook. He was released on Aug. 1 and outfitted with a satellite tag.

NOAA officials have known of R333 since 2015 and said he usually hangs out on Niihau but occasionally frequents shorelines around Kauai and Oahu. His satellite tag shows he headed back to Niihau following his release.

Dr. Michelle Barbieri, NOAA Fisheries veterinarian, said a barbed, circle hook was lodged deep in R333’s stomach.

The monk seal, weighing almost 400 pounts, was given anesthesia. Barbieri then used an endoscope and dehooking instrument that had been extended 16 inches to reach the hook, free it, slip a cover over it, and pull it out without snagging — avoiding a more invasive surgical procedure requiring a much longer recovery time.

It was the second seal hooking in the past two months. In June, Hawaiian monk seal RW02 swallowed a fishing hook, line and sinker.

A conscientious fisherman also reported that hooking to NOAA, and officials were able to track the male monk seal down on Oahu’s North Shore, remove the hook from his stomach and release him within about two weeks.

Schofield said fishermen by nature are conservationists, and he found in both cases they were motivated to help the seals by calling for help. Both want to remain anonymous.

Typically there are anywhere from six to a dozen hookings a year in the main Hawaiian Islands, Schofield said. Anyone who is fishing and spots a monk seal is encouraged to remove their lines until the seal has departed.

Hawaiian monk seals are a critically endangered species protected by state and federal laws. Only an estimated 1,400 Hawaiian monk seals remain in the wild.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"It was a grey and drizzling day last September when scientists on the island of Niihau discovered an emaciated female Hawaiian monk seal pup still sporting its black lanugo coat.

She was, they thought at first glance, a newborn. But instead of trying to suckle her mother for milk, the hungry seal, named Kilo, approached another youngster, eager to find sustenance from her. There was none.

The Marine Mammal Center of Sausalito, California, opened Ke Kai Ola on Hawaii Island in 2014 for just this reason—to rehabilitate monk seals like Kilo and return them to the wild.

When Dr. Michelle Barbieri, veterinarian with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program, first examined Kilo, she discovered a healed umbilicus and teeth erupting through the pup’s gums. That put Kilo’s age older than the black newborn fuzz would normally indicate—more like 3 to 4 weeks old. “She was so skinny,” Barbieri said. “But she was also so fierce. She’d survived long enough for certain developmental things to be happening, but she was not

well-nourished enough for everything to be happening at the same time.”

While it’s unclear what happened to Kilo’s mother, there was a rotting monk seal carcass on the beach; but, in general, it’s young monk seals like Kilo that struggle to survive on their own to adulthood after being weaned at about six weeks of age. Scientists have found if a seal makes it to 2 years old, it has a good chance for a long life, contributing to the species’ survival. By that time, the seal has figured out how to forage, and it’s grown to a size where it can compete with other apex predators for food.

At the same time Kilo was found, another five underweight female pups and one yearling were picked up around the uninhabited islands northwest of Niihau, where an estimated 85 percent of the endangered marine mammal’s population live. This remote area—known as Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, a protected conservation area—stretches some 1,300 miles beyond Honolulu.

Adding seven new patients to its roster, Ke Kai Ola has now treated 16 patients in less than two years. That’s 1 percent of the entire species, and it’s part of an aggressive intervention plan that seems to be paying off for the endangered animal.

After nearly 70 percent of the monk seal population died off during a 50-year period beginning in the 1950s, its decline has slowed—from an annual drop of 8 percent in the 1980s to 2.8 percent in the past decade. Dr. Charles Littnan, lead scientist with the Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program, reports that 30 percent of the 1,200 monk seals alive today are a result of his team’s efforts to remove hooks from seals caught on fishing lines, free seals entangled in marine debris, move young seals to areas of higher survival and, now with the help of Ke Kai Ola, rehabilitate individual seals abandoned or weaned at a weight that decades of data indicate will result in the animal’s eventual demise.

But Kilo was not just underweight. She was emaciated. “We tube-fed her five times a day,” Deb Wickham, operations manager at the facility, also known as the “monk seal hospital,” said. Kilo arrived weighing 17 kilograms, or 37 pounds. “Six days later, she’d lost two kilos, and that’s when I really got worried. It was another four days before she gained it back.”

Wickham has worked with elephant seals, harbor seals, and California sea lions at The Marine Mammal Center for 24 years. She knows pinnipeds. “But it took a while to get this seal moving forward.”

Eventually Kilo did move forward, her black coat replaced by a grey and creamy combination, and it was time to get her to eat whole fish.

The facility is designed to limit human interaction so seals retain their wild ways. Thus, a video-camera system allows Wickham and her volunteers to monitor her patients from another room. To simulate foraging in a natural environment, fish are hidden in a box weighted down with rocks on the bottom of the pool that seals have to flip over to find their meal.

Kilo wasn’t one of Wickham’s easiest patients. When she was first given live fish, she’d chase it, catch it, chew it up and toss the bits around her pool, but she wouldn’t eat it. Eventually, to Wickham’s and Barbieri’s relief, Kilo caught on and, by the time she left Ke Kai Ola seven months later, she weighed a healthy 157 pounds.

The plan was to release Kilo at her natal site, the beach on Niihau where she was born. But, seven months after Kilo was rescued, when the Hawaiian Monk Seal Research Program arrived to find six-foot seas and 25-knot winds, the result was something like the agitation cycle on your washing machine, and it was deemed unsafe to launch small-boat operations from the NOAA research ship Hi‘ialakai for transporting Kilo to shore. Forecasts for subsequent days indicated conditions would deteriorate more. Because there were six other monk seals on board the ship and a team of monk seal researchers to be dropped off at islands throughout Papahānaumokuākea for their summer field season, the ship motored on.

Five days later, the Hi‘ialakai arrived at Laysan, a northwestern Hawaiian island, about 900 miles northwest of Honolulu. There were sunny skies, warm breezes and, most important, calm seas. A shore pen was erected for Kilo, a place for her to acclimatize to her new life for a few days before being given freedom to explore the wide expanse of the Pacific Ocean.

“Once we put her in the pen, she bolted out onto the soft white sand, then rolled on her back, her favorite body orientation, and proceeded to completely cover herself with sand,” Barbieri said.

Now, Kilo faces the same challenges as any seal in the wild. Barbieri expects her to lose a little weight at first but stabilize in the weeks and months ahead as she gets to know her new surroundings. Fortunately, Laysan’s juvenile survival rates are some of the highest in the entire archipelago.

“It’s hugely satisfying to release Kilo in her natural surroundings, where her instincts can fully lead the way from now on,” Barbieri said, leaving Kilo on the island with field researchers who observed Kilo for several days. “I walked away hearing her barking behind me, her typical Kilo attitude, like a bookend to the vocal attitude she had when I first met her.”

When the gate to the shore pen was opened four days later, Kilo galumphed straight for the water, chasing small fish in the shallows, and rolling in the onshore break. Within a few minutes, she’d found another cruising seal, and the two headed north around the island and out of the researchers’ view.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"When we ponder the idea of the circle of life — the interconnectedness between all natural life on Earth, the connection between kitty litter and the endangered monk seal may not be obvious. Alas, scientists over the last couple decades have compiled evidence that cat feces, which often drains into the ocean in coastal cities, can infect Hawaiian monk seals with toxoplasmosis — a potentially fatal disease caused by a single-cell parasite.

Worse, there are only an estimated 1,400 Hawaiian monk seals left in the world, meaning that even a small number of toxoplasmosis-infected seals could comprise a significant percentage of the seal’s overall population.

Since 2001, which is when scientists observed the first fatality directly linked to the parasite, there have been 11 directly observed Hawaiian monk seal deaths — or about one percent of the species’ population, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Experts believe the real number could be much higher.

“We have 11 that have died, eight of which are female — and that is the scariest aspect of it, because they are the contributors to increasing the population,” Angela Amlia, Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery Coordinator at NOAA Fisheries Pacific Islands Regional Office, told Salon, adding that ""there may have been other[s] that have died."" “It is possible — and we don't know for certain — that it has to due with immunosuppression due to reproduction.”

Amlia explained that the monk seals “might not be able to fight off infections new or old ones that were already there . . . . that is one of the theories [as to] why females [monk seals] are more susceptible.”

In Hawaii, feral cats run rampant. That’s because the Hawaiian islands have the perfect combination of conditions for feral cat breeding: pleasant weather, lots of prey, and no predators, meaning their population keeps growing.

Yet Hawaii’s status as a feline paradise could further endanger the monk seal species. Toxoplasmosis is the biggest threat to the large sea mammals, followed by interactions with shorecasting gear, unattended nets, and human-inflicted trauma.

Toxoplasmosis is specific to cat feces because cats are the only animals that can defecate Toxoplasma gondii eggs, which are known as oocysts. Patricia Conrad, a professor of parasitology at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis, said this is not meant to “demonize cats,” but the parasite in its fatal form is specific to cats because of how the single-cell moves through their intestines.

Advertisement:

“All mammals and all birds are thought to be possible toxoplasma carriers, and can be infected by the parasite, they have proven it in over 250 species,” Conrad told Salon. “The things about cats is that cats are the only animals in which the parasite multiplies sexually; it has a whole different stage of its life cycle, the cell multiplies in the intestine.”

Conrad said that researchers do not currently know why this process is specific to cats, but are studying it.

Toxoplasmosa gondii frequently pops up in news stories about cat-human transmission, as humans, particularly cat owners, can and often do become infected. The organism evolved to alternate between rodent and the cat guts, mating in one and laying its eggs in the other; yet because rodents are naturally afraid of cats, the organism supposedly alters the brain of the rodent in order to make it attracted to the scent of cat urine. Humans can be infected with toxoplasmosis, though it is thought to be mostly benign and only dangerous for pregnant women. Some research has suggested infection can alter humans’ brains, too, and may actually be related to, or a partial cause of, schizophrenia.

As NOAA explained, while seals’ toxoplasmosis infections might seem like a natural occurrence — and a natural death for the monk seals — the threat is sustained by human cat owners.

“While disease may seem like a ‘natural’ cause of mortality, toxoplasmosis is perpetuated by free-roaming cats, and thus linked to human alteration of the environment,” NOAA states on its website.

Cats usually only get infected by the parasite when they eat raw meat, which is why Conrad recommends that people keep their cats indoors. Kitty litter is fine to use, but it is not recommended that cat-owners flush it down the toilet.

“When cats are kept indoors, they are not going to be to killing mice, rats and birds, so their chances of even getting infected are extremely low,” Conrad said. ""And the reality is, unlike dogs where we make people pick up the feces, cats can poop anywhere, they discreetly find a spot and cover it up with dirt,” she explained. In this way, cat feces can get washed into fresh water ways or directly into the ocean.

The threat is not specific to Hawaiian monk seals. In California, cat feces–borne toxoplasmosis threatens the Southern Sea Otter Population. The sea otters were so rare that they were believed to be extinct in the late 1930s, but their population slowly recovered throughout the twentieth century; they peaked in 2016 at an estimated 3,090, but there has been a slight decline since then.

The parasite has also been found in the tissue of beluga whales. The journal Diseases of Aquatic Organisms published a study that found 15 of 34 whales tested positive for the parasite. While that didn’t mean they died from it, it was still present in the species.

Conrad emphasized that not every animal that has it, like humans or whales, will die from it.

“Only a small portion of them die,” she said. “And what we don’t know is [why] seals are more sensitive to it.”

Amlia of the NOAA said many scientists are studying Hawaiian monk seals because the species is endangered and toxoplasmosis is a “big three” threat.

“We are working with partners to better understand the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in monk seals and better understand how many cats are on the landscape,” she said. “As of right now there is no vaccine work being done . . . . there is an experimental vaccine being tested but not in the U.S., so there is nothing available right now.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Hawaii Marine Animal Response, a nonprofit, announced Sunday that Hawaiian monk seal R5AY, or “Honey Girl,” gave birth to a healthy pup two weeks ago at an undisclosed beach on Oahu.

The pup, currently known as PO3, appears to be a boy and will be given a Hawaiian nickname by students from a Hawaiian immersion school in the community, according to Hawaii Marine Animal Response in an Instagram post. He will also be tagged and assigned a permanent number.

“Both mom and pup are doing well,” said HMAR. “R5AY is one of Oahu’s ‘rockstar’ moms and this is her 12th pup. HMAR volunteers are watching over the pair to provide outreach and observations to help PO3 grow up without disturbances.”

HMAR, a marine conservation group, works with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to protect marine species on Oahu and Molokai. HMAR volunteers help protect pups and educate the public about Hawaiian monk seals, while providing valuable observations to NOAA researchers.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"A 2-month old, female Hawaiian monk seal pup was recently found dead on Oahu’s North Shore, according to wildlife officials, with the circumstances surrounding her death indicating it was not of natural causes.

The seal, RL44, also known as Nanea, was discovered dead on the morning of Sept. 24. The case has been referred to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Law Enforcement for investigation.

RL44 was born on July 19 at Paradise Cove at Ko Olina. NOAA Fisheries and volunteers from Hawaii Marine Animal Response monitored her during her 6-week nursing period. After she weaned, NOAA decided to relocate her to a remote location on the North Shore, where she would have the opportunity to interact with other young, wild monk seals, and be less likely to be disturbed by humans or become fixated on people.

The same was done for Rocky’s pup, Kaimana, in 2017, who was born at Kaimana Beach Park in Waikiki.

“Management decisions like translocating a seal are carefully weighed in a series of in-depth risk assessments,” said NOAA Fisheries in a blog post. “All decisions are ultimately made with seal and human safety as the primary concern.”

In addition, the state Division of Aquatic Resources performed a sweep of the area where she would be translocated, and removed line, nets, hooks and other debris from the area to reduce the threat of entanglement. The translocation went smoothly, according to officials. HMAR volunteers observed RL44 socializing and playing with other seals in the area.

“Her smooth transition to her new home following the translocation and our hopes for her future were shattered by this tragic loss,” said NOAA Fisheries.

Auntie Nettie Tiffany, kahu of Lanikuhonua, who named the monk seal, said she “brought exactly what she seemed: peace for our water and our reefs for a period of time, so [they] had time to heal.”

Earlier this summer, NOAA also reported the death of a yearling male Hawaiian monk seal, RK88, also known as Kuokala, after likely drowning in a lay gill net. He was found dead Aug. 21 at Camp Erdman at Kaena Point.

Officials said post-mortem test results confirmed that RK88 was healthy at the time of death and there was no evidence of underlying disease or other health concerns. Necropsy results supported drowning in a lay gill net as the cause of death.

Hawaiian monk seals are a critically endangered species protected by federal and state laws. Only an estimated 1,400 remain in the wild — about 1,100 in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and 300 in the main Hawaiian islands.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Pohaku, a female Hawaiian monk seal suffering from toxoplasmosis, remains in stable, but guarded condition a week after she was moved from Oahu to Kona.

The U.S. Coast Guard last week transported Pohaku aboard an HC-130 Hercules airplane to Ke Kai Ola, a Hawaiian monk seal hospital run by The Marine Mammal Center in Kailua-Kona.

Pohaku, or RO28, was first taken in Jan. 22 by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials for intensive care at Ford Island after a volunteer saw her floating lethargically off Ko Olina a few days earlier and called to report it.

She was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, a parasitic disease spread primarily through cat feces, and considered one of the three largest threats to the endangered seals. Her condition slowly improved, and she was transferred to Ke Kai Ola for long-term care.

“Toxoplasmosis is a complex disease that requires daily management for an affected Hawaiian monk seal,” said Megan McGinnis, animal care program manager at Ke Kai Ola. “Pohaku’s prognosis remains guarded but our team is dedicated to providing the best quality care for this endangered patient.”

Pohaku was actually one of two monk seals infected with toxoplasmosis in January. The other one, a young, juvenile monk seal named Sole, was found dead on the shores of Laie, and determined to have suffered from toxoplasmosis following a necropsy. Sole was the 12th monk seal to have died from toxoplasmosis in Hawaii.

She has so far survived longer than any other monk seal diagnosed with the disease, NOAA officials said.

The Coast Guard has had a 13-year partnership with NOAA to transport the monk seals across the isles, including to and from the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. On average, the Coast Guard transports six marine mammals per year in conjunction with training.

Pohaku joins four other monk seals from the Northwestern Hawaiian islands that are already at Ke Kai Ola, but will remain in a separate pen due to her weak and lethargic state.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"An Alabama man was fined $1,500 for touching a Hawaiian monk seal as well as harassing a sea turtle on Kauai, and then posting the videos to Instagram, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

The Alabama resident, who was vacationing on Kauai last year, agreed to pay the fine, NOAA said.

NOAA’s Office of Law Enforcement in Hawaii used the man’s social media accounts to track down his home address, then issued the penalty in an effort to educate him about the federal laws protecting marine wildlife.

Hawaiian monk seals — with a population of about 1,400 remaining in the wild — are a critically endangered species protected by both state and federal laws, including the Marine Mammal Protection Act. All species of sea turtles in U.S. waters are listed as either threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), according to NOAA.

In recent years, NOAA Fisheries in the Pacific Islands has been monitoring social media for potential violations of both acts.

In the video posted on Instagram with #monkseals, the Alabama man walks up to a sleeping monk seal on Poipu Beach at night, and strokes it with his hand. The startled seal quickly turns toward him, and he runs away.

As further evidence that he knew what he was doing was wrong, he panned his camera to a sign from NOAA urging beachgoers to maintain a safe distance from wildlife.

Adam Kurtz, NOAA Fisheries wildlife management coordinator, said most visitors who make these violations have no ill will toward the animals or any intention to harm them.

“Violations are usually the result of things like tourists wanting to get a good, close picture with a seal or a thrill-seeker trying to get a rush,” said Kurtz in a statement. “But it’s really frustrating when you see people harass these animals.”

Also, the man could have been injured, he said, because Hawaiian monk seals are wild animals that can act unpredictably. The seal could have lunged at the man instead of simply turning toward him.

While investigating the man’s Instagram account, NOAA’s officer also found a video of him aggressively pursuing a sea turtle while snorkeling at Poipu.

NOAA’s guidelines for responsible marine wildlife viewing recommends a distance of 10 feet for sea turtles, 50 feet for monk seals, 50 yards for dolphins and small whales, and 100 yards for humpback whales. It is against the law to harass, feed, hunt, capture or kill wild sea turtles, seals and dolphins in the U.S.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"At least 19 species of birds from Maharashtra have been included in a list of ‘endangered bird’ species. This includes four species of vultures, black-headed ibis, black-tailed godwit, Eurasian curlew and the Lesser flamingos which are inhabitants of Mumbai.

The list put out by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) has, in all, 145 bird species.

The birds have been divided into four categories, of which the ‘critically endangered’ species is the most worrisome. The white-backed vulture is one of the 15 birds in this category, which also includes the pink-headed duck and the Himalayan quail which are considered extinct for all practical purposes.

Spokesperson of BNHS, Atul Sathe, says that there have been no confirmed sightings of these two species in the past few decades. “But since they were supposed to live in isolated areas, we cannot be sure. So, they’re still listed as ‘critically endangered’.”

The list was compiled with the help of Birdlife UK and BNHS whose scientists have been involved with various conservation studies all over the country.

“The study is based on observing local sightings, trade and the habitat of these species,” says Sathe. “It is not easy to get a proper count of birds. Our scientists share this information with associations abroad and thus create a research network.”

Dr Raju Kasambe, project manager of the Important Bird Areas programme of BNHS, says that destruction of habitats, wetlands and mudflats has put these species under threat of extinction.

“Last year we recorded around 10,000 lesser flamingos in Sewri mudflats. If they make that bridge [Trans Harbour link connecting Sewri to Navi Mumbai], this coastal ecosystem will be destroyed,” says Dr Kasambe.

Mumbai has been the haunt of birdwatchers since ages. Due to its coastal landscape and forest pockets, it is home to a large number of migratory and resident birds.

Diclofenac kills pain and vultures tooFour of the 15 critically endangered species are major vulture species which used to be seen in Mumbai in abundance. Their numbers had seen a drop of around 99% in the 1990s where the 4crore- strong population in the 1950s dropped to an estimated 10,000. Years of study revealed the cause to be the drug diclofenac administered to cattle as a painkiller and these scavengers who fed on mostly cattle carcasses started dying due to kidney failure in reaction to the drug.

Forest OwletThis species, with an estimated population of 50 to 249 mature individuals, has a tiny, severely fragmented population known from fewer than 12 locations in central Maharashtra. Forest in its range is being lost and degraded by illegal tree-cutting, timber besides forest fires. These threats are suspected to be causing a decline of 10-19% over 10 years.

Great Indian BustardIn Maharashtra, estimates suggest a population as low as 30 individuals. Encroachment is a major problem in many bustard areas, especially in and around bustard sanctuaries. Mining, stone- quarrying, growth of industries, power projects and expansion of roads, electric poles, wind turbines and other projects have increased the severity of habitat degradation

Black-headed IbisCommon in large wetland areas of India, this species is undergoing a population reduction. With an estimated population ranging between 10,000-19,999 mature individuals, it faces a full gambit of threats from hunting and disturbance at breeding colonies to drainage and conversion of foraging habitats to agriculture.

New Delhi, September 8: At least three to four species of animals, such as the Indian Cheetah, pink-headed duck, and the Great Indian Bustard, have become extinct due to desertification in India, researchers warned at the 14th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14). Sudan, World's Last Male Northern White Rhino Dead: 7 Animals That Went Extinct in Last Two Decades Courtesy Us!

""We have a database for more than 5.6 million specimens, collected from all over India and also from the neighbouring countries before independence. They give a lot of information about how things have changed in more than 100 years. If you see their distribution in geo-special platforms, you'll realise how much changes have occurred because of the impact of deforestation and desertification,"" Kailash Chandra, Director of the Zoological Survey of India, told ANI.

He said, ""A minimum of three to four species have already become extinct in India, such as India Cheetah, pink-headed duck, and the Great Indian Bustard,"" adding, ""Many more are on the verge of becoming extinct and therefore fall into the category of critically endangered species.""

""These specimens have reduced to less than 150,"" the researcher stressed.""This is a matter of great concern,"" he noted further. Chandra stressed that desertification may be caused due to insecticides, pesticides, conversion to agricultural land, industries and chemicals, indiscriminate development but ""everything has to be regulated so that it could be minimised and we can reverse this process back.""

The researcher also said that desertification not only impacts animals but the entire biodiversity, which includes microscopic animals to human beings.""The entire food chain is affected due to this (desertification),"" Chandra stressed.

It was also stated in the forum that India faces a growing crisis of land degradation. More than 30 per cent of its land area has been degraded through deforestation, over-cultivation, soil erosion and depletion of wetlands. The Convention, started earlier this week, came at a critical juncture when not only India but the entire world is facing problems regarding soil aridity, where some of the most vulnerable ecosystems can be found.";Recently Extinct Animals in India: Indian Cheetah, Pink-Headed Duck and Great Indian Bustard Are Extinct Due to Desertification;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEGU0XkDUMoFMGgVHVasZbyUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow7IeCCzDox_4CMNSQiAY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Recently-Extinct-Animals-in-India-784x441.jpg;09/11/2019;"[{'sent': 'Wikipedia Commons)\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Wikipedia Commons']}}, {'sent': 'New Delhi, September 8: At least three to four species of animals, such as the Indian Cheetah, pink-headed duck, and the Great Indian Bustard, have become extinct due to desertification in India, researchers warned at the 14th meeting of the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14).', 'ents': {'GPE': ['UNCCD', 'New Delhi', 'India'], 'CARDINAL': ['At least three to four'], 'PERSON': ['Cheetah'], 'ORG': ['the Conference of Parties', 'the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification']}}, {'sent': ""Sudan, World's Last Male Northern White Rhino Dead: 7 Animals That Went Extinct in Last Two Decades"", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan'], 'ORG': ['Last Male Northern White', 'World'], 'CARDINAL': ['7']}}, {'sent': '""We have a database for more than 5.6 million specimens, collected from all over India and also from the neighbouring countries before independence.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['more than 5.6 million'], 'GPE': ['India']}}, {'sent': 'If you see their distribution in geo-special platforms, you\'ll realise how much changes have occurred because of the impact of deforestation and desertification,"" Kailash Chandra, Director of the Zoological Survey of India, told ANI.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Kailash Chandra'], 'ORG': ['ANI', 'the Zoological Survey of India']}}, {'sent': 'He said, ""A minimum of three to four species have already become extinct in India, such as India Cheetah, pink-headed duck, and the Great Indian Bustard,"" adding, ""Many more are on the verge of becoming extinct and therefore fall into the category of critically endangered species.""\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['three to four'], 'GPE': ['India'], 'PERSON': ['Cheetah']}}, {'sent': '""These specimens have reduced to less than 150,"" the researcher stressed.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['less than 150']}}, {'sent': 'It was also stated in the forum that India faces a growing crisis of land degradation.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['India']}}, {'sent': 'More than 30 per cent of its land area has been degraded through deforestation, over-cultivation, soil erosion and depletion of wetlands.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['More than 30']}}, {'sent': 'The Convention, started earlier this week, came at a critical juncture when not only India but the entire world is facing problems regarding soil aridity, where some of the most vulnerable ecosystems can be found.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Convention'], 'GPE': ['India']}}]"

The silver-backed chevrotain, also known as the Vietnamese mouse deer has not been seen alive in three decades and was listed as one of the 25 “most wanted” lost species, compiled by Global Wildlife Conservation.

But there was cause for joy when the animals appeared on a camera trap in Nha Trang, in Vietnam, with the team capturing 1,881 photos over 5 months.

Biologist An Nguyen said: “For so long, this species has seemingly only existed as part of our imagination.

“Discovering that it is, indeed, still out there, is the first step in ensuring we don’t lose it again, and we’re moving quickly now to figure out how best to protect it.”

The discovery is giving hope for conservationists who hope other animals may be found.

Out of their 25 listed, five have been seen again, but 20 more remain missing.

Here, NICOLA BARDON looks at some of the animals who are considered ‘lost.’

PONDICHERRY SHARK LAST SEEN: In 1979 in India

THIS shark was usually about 3ft long and was once found in coastal waters off India, as well as parts of the Gulf of Oman.

It tended to stick to remote regions and has not been seen in nearly 40 years.

But there was some good news recently, as it is believed a team from the organisation Extinct or Alive may have spotted one in a remote village in Sri Lanka.

Researchers are waiting on test results to see if it is the Pondicherry shark.

NAMPDAPHA FLYING SQUIRREL

LAST SEEN: 1981, India

This rare species has only ever been seen once, in Namdapha National Park.

But although researchers have looks in the surrounding areas, they have never seen any other verified sightings.

It is believed they are found in dry forests near streams, and may just be in one particular area.

LONG BEAKED ECHIDNA LAST SEEN: 1961 in Indonesia

The Long-Beaked Echidna, if it is still alive, is just one of five surviving species of monotreme, an egg-laying mammal whose origins go back as far as 160 million years. They are considered critically endangered and was last collected by a Dutch botanist on an expedition in the Cyclops Mountain in 1961 But locals in the area believe they are still alive in the mountains

This animal came close to being declared the first primate to be declared extinct in more than 500 years after searches failed to show any evidence of any alive.

But research from hunters in 2000 and 2001 suggest that maybe there is a small number living in Cote d’Ivoire.

But there is no photographs or videos of the animal in existence.

PINK-HEADED DUCK LAST SEEN: in 1949 in India

It might seem strange to have a pink-headed duck and that is because it has been 70 years since they were last seen. But in 2006, there were reports that people had seen them, and conservationists have been searching since. They are hard to find due to living in tall thick grasslands and swamps

Around 285 million years ago, if you had been walking through a Permian floodplain, you might have seen a griffinfly — a dragonfly-like insect the size of a crow. It was huge, partly because atmospheric oxgen during this time was something like 31-35 percent (it's around 21 percent today), and it turns out oxygen is the limiting factor in how big a bug can get.

Although we no longer have dragonflies flying around with 2-foot (0.6-meter) wingspans, there are some standouts among modern insects. Take Wallace's giant bee (Megachile pluto), the world's largest bee, which can grow up to the size of an adult human's thumb — five times the size of the European honeybees you're used to seeing — with large mandibles used for scraping up tree resin to line their nests. It was recently thought to have gone the way of the griffinfly — nobody had seen Wallace's giant bee since 1981, and before that, no scientist had clapped eyes on it since its discovery in 1858 by Alfred Russel Wallace, the English biologist who independently conceived of the theory of evolution through natural selection at the same time as Charles Darwin. Of course, researchers knew this didn't mean it was extinct — it's just very difficult to prove an organism exists if you can't find it alive.

But in January 2019, a team of researchers traveled to a collection of little islands in Indonesia called the North Moluccas, and they found the bee behemoth nesting in a termite nest on a tree trunk.

""To actually see how beautiful and big the species is in life, to hear the sound of its giant wings thrumming as it flew past my head, was just incredible,"" said Clay Bolt, a natural history photographer who captured the first photos and video of a live giant bee, in a press release.

Over the years, a few research expeditions have set out to find Wallace's giant bee, but they came up empty-handed until now. In the meantime, however, specimens would show up for sale — a specimen showed up on eBay in 2018 that auctioned for $9,100. In case you were wondering, that's more than what the corpse of an insect usually goes for.

The exact island on which the bee was found is a secret because, as you can imagine from the price tag, if the researchers published that information, the remaining Wallace's giant bees might not be long for this world.

Since the bee has only been viewed a few times in the wild, not much is known about its habits and life history, other than that it seems to like to live in termite nests in lowland forest. Indonesia lost 15 percent of its tree cover between between 2001 and 2017 to make way for agricultural fields, so our rekindled romance with Wallace's giant bee might not last long if conservation efforts aren't put in place soon.

But in the meantime, it's nice to know Megachile pluto is still buzzing through the forest like a tiny helicopter. The giant griffinflies of the Permian would have wanted it that way.";Wallace's Giant Bee, World's Largest, Rediscovered;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vYW5pbWFscy5ob3dzdHVmZndvcmtzLmNvbS9pbnNlY3RzL3dhbGxhY2VzLWdpYW50LWJlZS13b3JsZHMtbGFyZ2VzdC1yZWRpc2NvdmVyZWQuaHRt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_1024/gif/giant-bee.jpg;03/04/2019;"[{'sent': '"" "" Entomologist and bee expert Eli Wyman with the first rediscovered individual of Wallace’s giant bee (Megachile pluto) in the Indonesian islands of the North Moluccas.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Eli Wyman', 'Megachile'], 'ORG': ['Wallace']}}, {'sent': 'Clay Bolt\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Clay Bolt']}}, {'sent': ""Take Wallace's giant bee (Megachile pluto), the world's largest bee, which can grow up to the size of an adult human's thumb — five times the size of the European honeybees you're used to seeing — with large mandibles used for scraping up tree resin to line their nests."", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Wallace'], 'PERSON': ['Megachile'], 'CARDINAL': ['five']}}, {'sent': ""It was recently thought to have gone the way of the griffinfly — nobody had seen Wallace's giant bee since 1981, and before that, no scientist had clapped eyes on it since its discovery in 1858 by Alfred Russel Wallace, the English biologist who independently conceived of the theory of evolution through natural selection at the same time as Charles Darwin."", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Wallace'], 'PERSON': ['Charles Darwin', 'Alfred Russel Wallace']}}, {'sent': 'But in January 2019, a team of researchers traveled to a collection of little islands in Indonesia called the North Moluccas, and they found the bee behemoth nesting in a termite nest on a tree trunk.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Indonesia']}}, {'sent': '""To actually see how beautiful and big the species is in life, to hear the sound of its giant wings thrumming as it flew past my head, was just incredible,"" said Clay Bolt, a natural history photographer who captured the first photos and video of a live giant bee, in a press release.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Clay Bolt']}}, {'sent': ""Over the years, a few research expeditions have set out to find Wallace's giant bee, but they came up empty-handed until now."", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Wallace']}}, {'sent': 'In the meantime, however, specimens would show up for sale — a specimen showed up on eBay in 2018 that auctioned for $9,100.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['eBay'], 'MONEY': ['9,100']}}, {'sent': ""The exact island on which the bee was found is a secret because, as you can imagine from the price tag, if the researchers published that information, the remaining Wallace's giant bees might not be long for this world.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Wallace']}}, {'sent': ""Indonesia lost 15 percent of its tree cover between between 2001 and 2017 to make way for agricultural fields, so our rekindled romance with Wallace's giant bee might not last long if conservation efforts aren't put in place soon.\n\n"", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Indonesia'], 'ORG': ['Wallace']}}, {'sent': ""But in the meantime, it's nice to know Megachile pluto is still buzzing through the forest like a tiny helicopter."", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Megachile']}}]"

Scientists recently revived a South African sub-species of zebra known as the quagga. This odd-looking zebra lacking stripes on its hind legs has been extinct for more than 100 years.

The last known quagga died in a zoo in Amsterdam in 1883. Inspired to resurrect the species, Reinhold Rau from the University of Cape Town founded The Quagga Project in 1987.

When analyzing DNA from original quagga skin, researchers found the extinct creature was genetically the same as the zebra. This means that the only true difference between the quagga and modern plains zebra (Equus Quagga) is their superficial markings.

In addition to the lack of black and white stripes on its hindquarters, the quaggas' coat turns to a darker brown color towards the back part of its body.

So Rau and his team looked for plains zebra that fit the profile -- less vivid black and white stripes on their hindquarters. Then, they selectively bred zebras to bring forth more and more quagga-like qualities.

""It's an attempt to try and repair ecological damage that was done a long time ago in some sort of small way,"" Eric Harley, a retired professor of chemical pathology at the University of Cape Town, said in a statement. ""It is also to try and get a representation back of a charismatic animal that used to live in South Africa.""

After several years of rebreeding the species, researchers claim that the quagga are back in action. It took five generations, but the selectively bred animals boast all the same traits as the quaggas once did.

""To all intents and purposes they are the quagga back again. The project has been a complete success,"" Harley added.

Quaggas were hunted to near extinction in the 19th century. Therefore The Quagga Project was an attempt to right wrongs and return a native South African species to the world after it was wrongly killed.

In response to ethical concerns raised, Harley said: ""We don't do genetic engineering, we aren't cloning, we aren't doing any particularly clever sort of embryo transfers-it is a very simple project of selective breeding.""

To appease critics, the team has decided to name the new animal Rau-quagga to set it apart from its predecessors. The hope is to keep the project running and to create a substantial herd of Rau-quagga to be released in their native homeland of South Africa.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"More than a century ago, in the wetlands around Kolkata, India, there lived a shy type of duck with a bright pink head. It was named, appropriately, the pink-headed duck. The males of the species had rosy pink bills and pink plumage covering their heads and necks. Some of them had light, blush-colored feathers; others were as bright as Pepto-Bismol. They were never particularly common, but hunters spotted them and on occasion bagged them while hunting bigger game. One of the last times anyone saw a pink-headed duck in the wild, it was in the mouth of a hunting dog, who delivered its carcass to Charles M. Inglis, curator of the Darjeeling museum, outside the Indian city of Darbhanga in June 1935.

Officially, the pink-headed duck is listed as critically endangered. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was in 1949. Though there have been reports of pink-headed ducks here and there in the decades since, many people now believe the birds are not just rare and shy, but extinct.

Richard Thorns is not among them. For years now, he has been searching for the pink-headed duck, and, since 2009, he has traveled six times to Myanmar, where he believes a flock of about 50 birds might live. Thorns, an enthusiastic, 53-year-old Englishman whose look can range from scholarly nerd to rugged adventurer, first learned about the pink-headed duck around 1997, from a library book on vanishing birds. At the time, he was working as a shop assistant. As he read about these stunning, rare birds, and the elephant grasses and lotus flowers that they lived among, he had a realization. “I didn’t want to be a shop assistant anymore,” he says. “I decided to look for the pink-headed duck. So I did, and I’ve been after it ever since.”

From his journeys in Myanmar, Thorns has developed a theory about exactly where the pink-headed duck could be hiding, and this fall he plans to return for a seventh search, as part of the Search for Lost Species. The campaign, created by Austin-based nonprofit Global Wildlife Conservation, will attempt to relocate a handful of more than 1,200 species considered “lost to science”—long unseen, unrecorded, and feared extinct. A century ago, pink-headed ducks could be found in Myanmar, and Thorns believes that it’s very possible the ducks are living there still, in parts of the country long closed to outsiders, out of sight of birdwatchers and conservation organizations.

To some, there’s little point in a quixotic search for a lost duck. These birds supposed to be extinct, after all. “The people who hope for the pink-headed duck are people prepared to think in a different way,” Thorns says. “It’s like a detective story. Have we just missed it? Or is it hidden where no one can go?”

Thorns is not the first to go looking for the elusive waterfowl. In the 1980s, Rory Nugent, an American adventurer and writer, heard about the duck from a friend. By two months later, he had sold his apartment, had put his belongings in storage, and was on his way to India. Like Thorns, Nugent believed he could find the duck in a part of the world troubled by violent conflict and usually off-limits. He waited for months for permission to travel the Brahmaputra River in Assam, which he spent searching for the duck in the bird markets of Kolkata (then still called Calcutta), in the towns of Sikkim, and on the border of India and Tibet. Finally, he and Shankar Barua, an artist and photographer whom he met in New Delhi, set out down the Brahmaputra and scoured the river for weeks. He never got a clear glimpse of his quarry, but by the end of the journey Nugent insisted, “We’ve seen it. We just didn’t notice it. … They’re not extinct, just hard to find.” His book about the adventure ends with a reported sighting and the author heading back upriver.

Part of the mystery surrounding the pink-headed duck is why it disappeared to begin with. Most species are driven to extinction by habitat loss, hunting, or predation by an invasive species, but there’s no obvious cause for the pink-headed duck’s disappearance. Though its habitat has diminished and it was hunted, other birds have survived the same circumstances. Since the pink-headed duck was always relatively rare, it is possible to imagine the bird is still hiding somewhere out there. Nugent’s report, another from Myanmar in 1968, and other more recent sightings are not considered robust enough to count as evidence for the duck’s continued survival. But stories of pink-headed duck sightings keep popping up, and some of the most recent come from the exact area of Myanmar where Thorns has been searching.

In 1910, a pink-headed duck, now stuffed and held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, turned up at a bazaar in Mandalay, one of the country’s largest cities. Since then, unconfirmed reports of the ducks have come from the country’s northern districts. In the early 2000s, two conservation groups—BirdLife International and Myanmar’s Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association (BANCA)—began surveying rivers, lakes, and wetlands in the region for pink-headed ducks.

In December 2004, the team was in the Nawng Kwin wetlands, north of vast Indawgyi Lake, when they met a young man named Saw Aung, who said he was familiar with the duck. One morning, the group went out into the grasslands, and Saw Aung flushed a flock of ducks from a wetland pool. A few dozen mallards rose into the air, and as three foreign birdwatchers peered through telescopes, one duck “broke off from the flock, climbed quite high, circled for 2 to 3 minutes, and then descended into the grassland,” the team later wrote in a published report. The three men agreed: The bird, medium-sized, had a pale head and neck, a dark body, and dark upper wings. It looked a lot like a pink-headed duck.

In that part of the world, though, there is another bird with similar features, the spot-billed duck. The men discussed the features that would distinguish one bird from another—in particular, white feathers on the underside of the wing, a characteristic of the spot-billed duck. Had they seen those feathers? One of the three observers thought he had. Though another thought it was “very likely” they had seen a pink-headed duck, the other two weren’t so sure. They couldn’t rule out the possibility that they’d seen a variety of spot-billed duck. “On balance, therefore, this record should be treated as a possible but unconfirmed sighting of Pink-headed Duck,” they wrote. The thrilling moment had passed too quickly for any semblance of certainty.

Before beginning his search, Thorns was not a serious birder. “My brother is the person to talk to there,” he says. “He is a real hotshot birder.” But once he heard of the pink-headed duck, he never forgot about the bird, its beauty, and the beauty of its habitat. “I inherited my grandfather’s instincts as an explorer,” he says. “I think a lot of it was … I wasn’t doing very much. I didn’t really feel fulfilled. The pink-headed duck is like some sort of mythical thing. It is so iconic and beautiful.” The idea of finding something missing for so many years gave him a mission.

In his first visits to Myanmar, Thorns tried to keep himself and his purpose as well concealed as the fowl he was searching for. Before 2011, the country was still ruled by the military junta that had been in power since 1962, and even today the government restricts the movements of foreign travelers in certain parts of the country. Myanmar is rich in jade, gold, and other treasures. Some of the most resource-rich areas are off-limits, and in the north ethnic independence armies are still in conflict with government forces. But for pink-headed duck seekers, those same areas are some of the most promising targets, full of marshy, undeveloped, restricted habitat. To find the duck, Thorns figured he would need to sneak into places he technically was not supposed to be.

Thorns made his way north to visit towns on the Ayeyarwady River, following historic reports, and to Indawgyi Lake, where the 2004 expedition made its possible sighting. In Bhamo, he sought out a man named Sein Win. Thorns had read in a Lonely Planet guide that this man was locally famous for having built his own helicopter. “I figured that if he was eccentric enough to have built a helicopter, he might not be too averse to being my guide,” Thorns says. They snuck farther upriver than the government allowed, but they did not go unnoticed. One time they had to wait on the boat until night fell to sneak downriver, hide in a temple, and pretend they were coming back into town from the south. Another time, Thorns traveled to a promising lake only to find it was on the wrong, off-limits side of the river. He had to offer a boatman “a million kyat”—hundreds of dollars—to take him across.

All that risk-taking had an impact. On his third trip, in 2012, the conflict in the country’s north had heated up, and sneaking upriver on a boat was no longer an option. So Thorns rented a bicycle and tried to pedal out of town. “Looking back at it now, it was a mad thing to do,” he says. On the small road, two kids roared by on a motorbike, and as Thorns fell, his hand collided with their vehicle. A well-meaning woman brought him ointment, but he knew the hand was broken. Even today he can’t open it properly.

That year Thorns spent part of his trip relaxing on the beach and in Mandalay’s public baths, but it was a breakthrough of sorts. He had first learned about the pink-headed duck in his early 30s, and he was then in his late 40s. He had worked for more than a decade as a driver, mostly for a local hospital, and never had much money. Financing the trips required single-minded purpose—between each he worked as much as possible to pay off debts from the previous one and save for the next. It’s been a very long time, he says, since he’s had girlfriend. Though he had some financial help from an anonymous backer, over the years, he estimates he has spent £12,000—the equivalent of $15,000 at today’s exchange rate—of his own money on his fruitless search. It wasn’t wise, but it was worth it, he believed. If he could find the pink-headed duck, he could change history. But he needed to change his strategy. He resolved to stop sneaking around and embrace the authorities.

Through BANCA, Thorns built relationships with guides and travel agencies to help him get permits to travel to the more remote places on his list of potential pink-headed duck hotspots. On his most recent trip, in 2016, he had an experience that convinced him he might be getting closer. On his last day in the field, he was in a village where he’d been in 2010. Thorns and his guide were showing their bird book to locals, and one man came into the café. He pointed to the pink-headed duck and said that the bird was very rare.

“Has he ever seen it?” Thorns asked, through the guide and interpreter, Lay Win.

No, he hadn’t, the man replied. Thorns probed further. Had he never seen it at all?

Oh, he had seen it elsewhere, the man said. It was five or six years ago … up in the wetlands.

“I was there in 2010; I was just asking the wrong person in the village,” says Thorns. “He said that it was very rare and extremely shy. You can only find it in a certain part of the wetlands.”

That night, Thorns and his guide were sitting by the water, having a beer. Thorns asked the guide, whom he describes as “very cautious guy,” if he thought the man had really seen the duck.

“Yes,” he said. “I think he did see it.”

After consulting with BANCA, Thorns now believes that the pink-headed duck may visit that area in the wet season before migrating elsewhere, to a valley where outsiders are not allowed, for the rest of the year. “The people who were reporting the pink-headed duck were not tourists or birders,” he says. “They were hunters, travelers, farmers. They’re all people who have no choice but to go into a swamp in the rainy season.” He now plans to return to Myanmar this fall, starting in the last week of October, when traveling the country is “like being in a washing machine,” to continue the search. He is working with Global Wildlife Conservation to fund the trip, but his team is also raising funds on its own. This time, Thorns also plans to hire an elephant to help flush the birds out and increase the chance that the pink-headed duck will briefly reveal itself.

If Thorns and his companions on this next journey, naturalist and writer Errol Fuller, photographer John Hodges, and Hodges’s partner, Pilar Bueno, do make a sighting, they may need to keep the exact location secret. “I can’t emphasize enough how sought after a pink-headed duck head would be,” Thorns says. “You have to be very, very careful.”

In fact, it’s possible that a European birdwatcher has already seen the duck in the same area Thorns will search. When Thorns visited the area the first time, he was told about a Dutch man who came each year, for five years, and hired an elephant, in search of the pink-headed duck. On his fifth visit, he came back from the wetland triumphant—he was sure he had seen the bird, he told locals, but had not managed to take a picture.

“You don’t know how you will behave” upon finding the duck, says Thorns. “I remember once finding an opal in this old abandoned heap of junk. There was a dividing line—I went from not having an opal to having an opal in my pocket. But these things happen. It’s hard to know how you’re going to react.” If all goes well, it will be the same scenario. One minute, no one will have definitively seen the duck for decades. The next, Thorns will have conclusively identified, photographed, and rediscovered the pink-headed duck. Known again to science. No longer lost.

“If anyone is going to find the pink-headed duck,” he says, “I want it to be me.”";In Search of the Elusive Pink-Headed Duck;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0bGFzb2JzY3VyYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGluay1oZWFkZWQtZHVjay1zZWFyY2gtbG9zdC1zcGVjaWVzLWV4dGluY3TSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdGxhc29ic2N1cmEuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3BpbmstaGVhZGVkLWR1Y2stc2VhcmNoLWxvc3Qtc3BlY2llcy1leHRpbmN0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzLzc5YmJmNzk4NGRlNWMxMTI1ZF92MS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/v1.jpg;06/01/2017;"[{'sent': 'More than a century ago, in the wetlands around Kolkata, India, there lived a shy type of duck with a bright pink head.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Kolkata', 'India']}}, {'sent': 'Some of them had light, blush-colored feathers; others were as bright as Pepto-Bismol.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Pepto-Bismol']}}, {'sent': 'One of the last times anyone saw a pink-headed duck in the wild, it was in the mouth of a hunting dog, who delivered its carcass to Charles M.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"A lost species of salamander has been rediscovered alive and well in Guatemala.

The Jackson's Climbing Salamander (Bolitoglossa jacksoni), a brilliant yellow-and-black amphibian, was last seen in 1975 and feared extinct. But this month, a guard at the Finca San Isidro Amphibian Reserve (also called the Yal Unin Yul Witz Reserve) in the Cuchumatanes Mountains spotted a juvenile of the species while out on patrol. The guard, Ramos León, snapped a photo and sent it to Carlos Vasquez, a curator of herpetology at USAC University in Guatemala, who confirmed its identity.

Vasquez himself had spent more than 3,000 hours hunting for the salamander since 2005, and trained León and his fellow guards on how to search for it.

""We had started to fear that the species was gone, and now it's like it has come back from extinction,"" he said. ""It's a beautiful story and marks a promised future for the conservation of this special region."" [Golden Wonder: Photos of the Jackson's Climbing Salamander]

Stunning rediscovery

The Jackson's Climbing Salamander is known as the ""golden wonder"" for its bright-yellow body, which is topped by a black streak running from its head to most of the way down its tail. It's named after its discoverer, Jeremy Jackson, who first identified it while exploring the Cuchumatanes with his friend Paul Elias, who was a college student at the time. They found three new species of salamander on that trip, including the long-limbed salamander (Nyctanolis pernix) and the Finca Chiblac Salamander (Bradytriton silus). Those species were found again on expeditions in 2009 and 2010, but the Jackson's salamander stayed missing.

The nonprofit group Global Wildlife Conservation put the Jackson's salamander on its Top 25 ""most wanted species"" list as part of its Search for Lost Species initiative. The initiative, which launched in April, aims to seek out 25 species that have not been seen for years or decades but aren't confirmed extinct. Among them are the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus mayri), seen only once in 1928 in Indonesia, and the pink-headed duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea), last seen in Myanmar in 1949.

Finding lost species

It was shocking to find the Jackson's salamander so quickly, said Lindsay Renick Mayer, a spokesperson for Global Wildlife Conservation. The group had planned an expedition to the region to search for the salamander in January, but León found the amphibian first.

""The night I got the news from Carlos that Bolitoglossa jacksoni had been rediscovered, I flew off the couch where I'd been falling asleep, let loose a string of expletives (in a good way), and did a little happy dance,"" Jackson, the salamander's original discoverer, said in a statement. He went on to praise the reserve that has protected the unwitting salamander species throughout the years.

""I'm more than delighted that Yal Unin Yu Witz exists so that Jacksoni and other wonders can survive, and I'm so pleased to hear that it was a guard protecting the preserve who found this beauty,"" he said.

""I love this story because it conveys how protecting habitat gives species a fighting chance to survive on this planet,"" Don Church, the president of the Austin, Texas-based Global Wildlife Conservation, said in the statement. ""This rediscovery can only be a good omen for the future of the Search for Lost Species campaign. It's a sign that if we get out there and work at it, many of these species can be found and saved.""

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"A duck with a pink head, a tree-climbing crab, and a monkey with red thighs are among the targets of a new global hunt for ""lost"" species.

Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC), an organization based in Austin, Texas, with a focus on biodiversity and wildland preservation, has launched a new initiative to search for 25 species that have not been seen for years or decades — or, in the case of the Fernandina Galapagos tortoise, more than a century. The goal is to see if any of the species still survive and, if so, save them.

""While we're not sure how many of our target species we'll be able to find, for many of these forgotten species, this is likely their last chance to be saved from extinction,"" GWC spokesperson Robin Moore said in a statement. [10 Extinct Giants That Once Roamed North America]

Lost but not forgotten

The group is focusing on species that have not been seen since at least 2007. Collaborating with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), GWC actually came up with a list of 1,200 ""lost"" species but chose the charismatic creatures with decent chances of being saved, if they can be found.

On the list is the Syr-darya shovelnose sturgeon (Pseudoscaphirhynchus fedtschenkoi), a fish once found only in the Syr Darya river of Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan that has not been seen since the 1960s. Both the silvery Zug's monitor (Varanus zugorum) and the Wallace's giant bee (Megachile pluto), the latter of which is considered the world's largest bee, have been missing from Indonesia since the early 1980s. Another lost denizen of Indonesia is the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus mayri), a teddy-bear-faced marsupial missing since 1928.

Also on the most-wanted list are the Sierra Leone crab, a freshwater, tree-climbing crustacean not seen since 1955; the elusive Pondicherry shark (Carcharhinus hemiodon), not seen in its Indo-Pacific coastal habitat since the late 1970s; and the riotously colored Sinu parakeet, missing from Colombia since 1949.

Scientists will also be searching for the pink-headed duck (Rhodonessa caryophyllacea) — a brown diving duck with a distinctive pink head and neck. The species was last seen in 1949 in Myanmar. They'll also hunt in the Ivory Coast for Miss Waldron's red colobus (Piliocolobus waldronae), a monkey known for the scarlet fur on its thighs and forehead, which has not been seen since 1978.

Hope for the missing

Some species on the list threaten to slip out of living memory. The Fernandina Galapagos tortoise lived on Fernandina, the least-disturbed island in the Galapagos archipelago. The first specimen was collected in 1906, and the turtle hasn't been seen since.

Missing doesn't mean extinct, however. The Omilteme cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus insonus) from Guerrero, Mexico — one of the top 25 animals on the wanted list — disappeared from humanity's radar soon after its discovery in 1904. In 1998, however, researchers went looking and found two dead specimens. Now, GWC hopes to find living examples of the shy rabbits.

One species on the list has never been seen in the wild. Hippocampus minotaur, the bullneck seahorse, is known from four museum specimens collected between 1927 and 1981, according to the IUCN. No one knows anything about its behavior in the wild, its habitat or its population numbers.

The Search for Lost Species project is currently in the fundraising phase, with a goal of launching expeditions by the fall. More information can be found at lostspecies.org.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"TERA, KUTCH, India - One-metre tall and weighing up to 15kg, it is the Robocop of big birds, steadily stalking the vast grasslands, its head swivelling rhythmically as it sweeps the surroundings and scans the ground.

It seems to never break stride, its long legs walking almost as fast as a man's. I saw one last week with a big scorpion; it had the formidable 13cm-long black insect clamped in its beak, helplessly dangling by one of its pincers.

The only problem is the grasslands, its natural habitat, are now not so vast. The Great Indian Bustard is in deep trouble, and nearing the end of its days.

Today its population, in just three Indian states and a handful in Pakistan, is estimated at about 200 to 300. Experts put the number lower, at around 150.

This makes the GIB, as it is sometimes referred to, one of the rarest birds in the world.

""Population estimates... suggest that the species has undergone a decline equivalent to around 82 per cent over 47 years,"" says BirdLife International, a non-profit group.

A confluence of factors is against the big bird. And while people dither about what to do to save it, the GIB is striding, seemingly inexorably, towards its own extinction - and in our lifetime.

The Great Indian Bustard was once plentiful, but hunting drove it to low numbers. After being protected from hunting since the 1970s, it is newly beleaguered.

For one thing, it has a slow reproduction rate, nesting on open ground, laying only one egg, and in rare cases two, just once a year.

For another, the grasslands, often classified as wasteland in government records and thus vulnerable to exploitation from mining, industry and agriculture, have shrunk dramatically.

In the Kutch district of Gujarat state, where I saw the bird with the scorpion, farmers from as far away as Punjab are ploughing the grasslands to grow crops like cotton and castor. This destroys an entire ecosystem. Roads crisscross the habitat; giant wind turbines, their blades slicing the air around them, punctuate it. The low-flying bird has collided with high tension wires and died.

Chicks have a hard time surviving not just natural predators but also packs of free-ranging stray dogs from nearby villages. And there remains occasional poaching. ""The Great Indian Bustard is the only bird species in India which has nine protected areas designated for its conservation,"" writes scientist Dr Pramod Patil, who has won a Whitley Award for his work for the species. ""Unfortunately, we have lost the bustard from four of those. At all these places community resentment seems to be the major reason.""

Wildlife scientists Sutirtha Dutta, Asad R. Rahmani and Y.V. Jhala wrote in a 2010 paper: ""The declining rate of GIB populations calls for immediate commencement of ex situ conservation breeding programmes."" In other words, breeding the birds in a captive facility.

Five years on, the federal government in New Delhi, and the governments of the states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, where the birds are found in the wild, are still edging towards a captive breeding programme. But there remains no real agreement on what is to be done.

Conservationists are divided over a breeding programme, which would mean taking eggs from the wild and hatching them in a special facility.

Studies say a captive breeding programme would need around eight to 10 eggs a year to be removed from the wild - for a gain that is at best uncertain and at worst could turn into a disaster for the species if the breeding fails. Some say with so few GIBs, a failed programme would drive the bird faster into extinction. Focus on restoring and securing the GIB's natural habitat should be uppermost, they argue.

In a paper published in the journal Applied Ecology in June 2015 titled ""Ark or Park"" that specifically modelled captive breeding scenarios for the GIB, scientists Paul M. Dolma, Nigel J. Collar, Keith M. Scotland and Robert. J. Burnside wrote: ""When species face extinction, captive breeding may be appropriate.""

But it added: ""However, captive breeding may be unsuccessful, while reducing motivation and resources for in situ conservation. For the great Indian bustard… rapid implementation of in situ conservation offers a better chance to avoid extinction.""

The pro-breeding lobby argues that Saudi Arabia has had success breeding Houbara bustards, and that Britain has a captive-bred great bustard programme that has released some birds into the wild. In a classic example involving the California condor, the few remaining birds were taken from the wild in 1987and put into a captive breeding programme. At first controversial because of the risk, the programme has been successful; there are roughly 150 birds in the wild now.

On one thing the experts on both sides of the divide are agreed: It is imperative to preserve and better still restore some of the bird's habitat, and ensure the support of local communities by still giving them their rights, to grazing for instance.

Saving the bird in the wild is the preferable option, the experts agree. At the very worst, cynics say, that may ensure there is some habitat left for any the captive stocks to be introduced into.

""Most if not all grasslands (whatever is left) are open to people where overgrazing is a huge issue,"" says Dr Asad Rahmani, former principal and director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) - who has been studying bustards for 30 years.

""We need many totally protected grasslands where GIBs can breed successfully; and after the breeding season is over these grasslands can be open for grazing by livestock of nearby villages.""

""There are only two options for us - the GIB is extinct, or is extinct in the wild,"" he says. But a captive breeding programme could not afford to be a failure, he added.

Setting up a breeding programme from scratch is a complicated business, requiring resources and specialised training. Much depends on the governments of the two main GIB states - Rajasthan and Gujarat. Both do want to save the Great Indian Bustard ; it is Rajasthan's state bird. But Rajasthan has said it will not allow any eggs to be taken for artificial incubation in Gujarat.

Both states may end up going it alone if they cannot overcome their differences and mutual scepticism. That is not necessarily a bad thing. ""The rate of decline of grasslands, and with them now GIBs, is so fast now that we should encourage out-of-the-box thinking, and try multiple approaches in different areas,"" says Dr K.S. Gopi Sundar, a scientist with the Cranes and Wetlands Programme of the Nature Conservation Foundation in Bangalore, India.

Thus to ensure there are birds - and habitat - left to save by the time any captive breeding gets started, it is critical to protect the last of the GIB's habitat, and do it now.

""Habitat conservation and restoration are very urgently needed,"" underlines Dr Gopi Sundar. ""The classification of grasslands as 'wastelands' by the Indian government is fuelling conversion to agriculture and other uses. This must stop.""

The state forest departments and conservationists are already taking measures to protect the Great Indian Bustards. In Kutch, the department bans vehicle movement through the birds' habitat in the breeding months, employs men on motorbikes to watch over the birds, and has built fences to keep agricultural encroachment at bay from the little protected grassland that is left.

But it is currently a holding battle spread across sporadic and in some cases only tenuously connected and shrinking islands of habitat.

The money is available for more to be done; it just needs the political will.

Gujarat, for instance, is building a statue which will be the tallest in the world at 182m, of independence hero and native son Vallabhbhai Patel, at a cost of over US$250 million (S$352.7 million). A small fraction of that kind of money could buy back the iconic GIB's habitat in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state.

Not saving the Great Indian Bustard will be a particularly dreadful failure.

It would be the first species in India since the pink-headed duck in the 1950s to pass into permanent oblivion.

New Delhi: In December 2013, the United Nations declared 3 March — the day the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora was signed in 1973 — as World Wildlife Day. The aim was to celebrate and raise awareness about the world’s wild flora and fauna and promote conservation efforts.

World Wildlife Day has now become the most important global annual event dedicated to wildlife. The theme for this year is the rather broadbased ‘Sustaining All Life on Earth’, encompassing all wild animal and plant species as key components of the world’s biodiversity.

What causes extinction?

Extinction of wildlife can be natural or due to human activity. However, in today’s times, the latter far outweighs the former. It is estimated that we are losing 200 to 2,000 species every year, at the very least. Human activity could be indirect, such as its contribution to climate change, or direct, such as poaching. When the tiger population in India fell from 100,000 to 2,000 in the 20th century, for example, the main reason was poaching. In Australia, the extinction of megafauna occurred 45,000 years ago when humans arrived on the continent.

Prehuman events such as the Ice Age have also caused mass extinctions, but contemporary threats to wildlife are often a combination of human activity and natural factors. Two such examples are the Amazon fires and the Australian bushfires, which occurred last year. They were perhaps natural, but accelerated to unprecedented levels because of human activity, notably deforestation and climate change. It is estimated that 2.3 million animals died in the Amazon, and more than a billion in Australia.

Where does India stand?

India, home to four biodiversity hotspots and a variety of ecosystems and terrains, including mountains, rainforests, coasts, plains and deserts, has about 7.6 per cent of the world’s mammals, 14.7 per cent of all amphibians, 6 per cent of birds, 6.2 per cent of reptiles, and 6 per cent of flowering plant species.

According to reports, four species of fauna and 18 species of flora have gone extinct in India in the past few centuries, including the cheetah, the Sumatran rhinoceros, the Himalayan quail and the pink-headed duck. Protecting tigers, leopards and pangolins (the last is reportedly the most trafficked animal in the world) is difficult, given the huge demand for them from neighbouring China, but this may change as Beijing is reportedly willing to crack down on wildlife trade following the coronavirus outbreak.

India has seen a few conservation successes lately. The population of leopards, tigers and lions fell sharply in the 20th century, but is now seeing a recovery. India’s tiger population has doubled in the past 12 years. Experts give the credit to protection efforts by government and nongovernment organisations. The development of the tourism industry around wildlife has also helped the cause. Several former poachers now protect wildlife and have become safari guides.

Like tigers, India has seen success in many other species. The Gir forest in Gujarat is home to the only surviving population of Asiatic lions in the world. In the late 1960s, there were only about 180 Asiatic lions. As of 2018, there are more than 600. India must continue this effort to fulfil its responsibility and stay true to Article 51A (g) of the Constitution, which says “it is the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife and to have compassion for living creatures”.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"After the Pink-headed Duck and the King Vulture, the magnifient White-bellied Heron (WBH) in Assam is all set to go the Dodo way. The absence or disappearance of the White bellied Heron is a matter of grave concern for conservationists. The bird is on the edge of extinction or may have gone extinct in Assam since sighting of the bird becomes very rare. Ornithologists say, there may be a few White bellied herons left in Manas National Park along the Bhutan border, but not sure whether they are resident or flew in from the Bhutan side. A few years back, photograph of this rare bird with a noose around its neck in a village in lower Assam sent shock waves among bird lovers of the state. There was also a news of a rare heron pair seen hanging from electric lines in the Bhutan side a couple of years back.

Once a resident and also a locally migratory species in Assam, shrinking of habitat brought the bird to the edge. These birds are often seen along the banks of Punatshangchu basin in central Bhutan and there are occasional sightings in the Assam-Bhutan border areas and in the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border areas. There has been no report of nesting of this recluse bird in the Assam side for the last ten years.

The survival of the White-bellied heron (Ardea Insignis), one of the 50 rarest birds in the world that has an estimated global population of less than 250, greatly depends on the existence of their wetland habitat.

Distribution and habitat:

The White-bellied Heron is Critically Endangered in the IUCN list, with a population as low as 50–249 individuals. These birds exist in very low numbers over a large area comprising Bhutan, Yunan in China, northern Myanmar and northeast India. The species is found in the wetlands of tropical and subtropical forests in the foothills of the eastern Himalayas -- in India and Myanmar. It is spotted in Bhutan's sub-tropical areas and was also once found in Nepal. Traces of heron chicks were sighted in Zhemgang in Central Bhutan also. Herons mostly dwell in Southeast Asian countries and Bhutan shelters a little over 30 herons in the Himalayan region. Once eight nesting sites were identified amongst lofty flowing waters with pebbly substrates and Chir pine forests in Bhutan. A nesting site of this extremely rare White bellied Heron was also discovered in the Namdapha Tiger Reserve in Arunachal Pradesh. This is the first known nesting site of the WBH in India. Nest of the bird was found about 18 metres above ground on an East Indian almond (Terminalia myriocarpa) tree. In 2015, ornithologists observed the courtship of a pair of white-bellied heron.The courtship begins in the winter from January to February as the river water recedes. The birds chase after each other playfully with sticks and calling out to partners. The pair went on to build a nest at the site. This is the first nesting site of the bird to be scientificly identified in Namdapha, Arunachal Pradesh, India. Before the discovery of this site, Bhutan was (thought to be) the only country in the world to have a breeding population of the White-bellied Heron. Bhutan is home to about 10 per cent of the world’s total population of these birds.

The black-necked crane is another rare bird that breeds on the Tibetan Plateau and winters mainly in the lower altitudes of Quinghai, on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, north-eastern Bhutan and Zemithang and Sangty Valley in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh. It is the only high altitude crane amongst the 15 species found in the world.

Dr Anwaruddin Choudhury, a renowned orinithologist and author said that Unlike the Black-necked stork, that has a wider range from Bangladesh to Myanmar, the White bellied Heron's range is constricted. While the number of Black-necked stork in Assam is highest (about a 100), the number of White bellied Heron is thought to be only about 50 in India that also includes a few in the Manas National Park in the Assam side of the Indo-Bhutan border. But the number and nesting of the bird in this side remains unpredictable.

An “extremely shy” bird, the White bellied Heron feeds on fish in clear fast flowing rivers and wetlands. The confluence of Noa-Dihing and Namdapha rivers in the Namdapha Tiger Reserve supports a few individuals of white-bellied heron by providing them with freshwater fish.

Threats

Poaching is one of the main causes for the disappearance of the species. Since it is a big bird and easy to kill people hunt it for meat. Further, development activities in hilly terrains in the Indo-Bhutan border constricted its habitat and nesting sites.

Climate change is adding to the loss of habitat for many swampy birds. In a survey conducted by a local NGO Nature's Foster, it was found that many Asian water fowls are now on the brink of danger due to degradation of wetlands. No existence could be found of more than 20 wetlands in western Assam in the survey either due to climate change impacts or conversion of these wetlands for other activities.

The major factors for the decline in the population of the species include---loss, modification, fragmentation and degradation of habitat, poaching and land use patterns, particularly conversion of large areas for cultivation, harvesting of wetland resources etc. Other significant threats in key protected areas e.g. Namdapha National Park in north-east India, Bhutan and Myanmar are high levels of disturbance and developmental activities like sand mining, stone crushing, hydel projects etc.

The dams have already destroyed some nesting habitats of the species. The uppermost dam seen under construction in Bhutan will not have a large reservoir but reportedly may back up water into some of the areas considered prime White- bellied Heron habitat. With hydropower plant construction breaking ground in the last two decades, the once-stable heron population started dropping in thir last bastion.

Survey

The Centre for Conservation, Education and Research-- a conservationist group based in Guwahati has been engaged in the survey of wetland birds since the last 10 years. In the survey, no sighting was recorded of the WBH from its earlier known as habitats. There were reports of sighting of only two birds in Chirang and Baksa districts in the winter of 2011-12.The birds, flew in from the Bhutan side. The bird that was sighted in Baksa district was captured and killed in a village bordering Bhutan. In an earlier instance, a juvenile bird from Koilamoila in Manas Reserve Forest, Assam, near the foothills of Bhutan was rescued sometime in 2007. Reportedly one more heron was captured in Baksa near Assam-Bhutan border and the bird died in captivity before it was rescued.

Attacks on the bird and their eggs by predators remains a major cause in the reduction of their numbers. Lack of scientific approach and poor awareness among the local communities has also brought doom to the beautiful bird.

Conclusion:

There has been no major initiative for protecting the habitat of a critically endangered species. Government of India, had funded a three-year study on the species with a view to document the foraging behaviour of the bird, but the study did not cover the cause of decline of the species properly.

Develoment activities brought the White-bellied Heron to the verge of extinction. It was observed that the bird collect their food in the wetlands in day time and build their nest or take rests at night in trees in nearby forest. If one component is disturbed the bird moves to another secure place. For the survival of the species, therefore, both wetland and forest ecosystem are necessary. The thrust should therefore be more on the protection, restoration and preservation of wetland areas and the forest canopies.

Effects of space on mutation rate and diversity of human persistent viruses

Nasa has received grants and contracts for $80,000 to investigate what effects space travel has on herpes.

Researchers hope to understand the mutation rate and why symptoms of the virus become worse when it leaves Earth.

'The goal of this study will be to determine the changes in the genomic and mutational diversity that is present in the Herpesvirus virome present in astronaut saliva and urine samples collected before, during, and after space flight,' said Nasa.

Nasa will be studying the effects of space travel on the herpes virus. Researchers how to understand the mutation rate and why symptoms of the virus become worse when it leaves Earth.: Pictured, a Light micrograph of human skin cells infected with Herpes Simplex viruses, at a magnification of x80.

WHAT ARE TYPES OF HERPES ARE BEING STUDIED? Epstein Barr virus: Also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a member of the herpes virus family and is spread bodily fluids, mainly saliva. Varicella zoster: Known to infect humans and vertebrates. It only affects humans, and commonly causes chickenpox in children, teens and young adults Cytomegalovirus: It spreads from person to person through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, urine, semen and breast milk. Herpes simplex viruses: Can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type 2. In HSV-2, the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum.

Nasa has been given a few grants and contrast to use a researcher facility at the University of Florida to understand the 'effect of spaceflight on herpseviros genome stability and diversity', reported The Washington Free Beacon.

And last month, the organization was awarded an additional $15,000 for the study.

'Ground subjects will serve as the control group providing saliva and urine samples pre-flight and post-flight during the same schedule as the astronauts,' explained Nasa.

The study will focuse on four different types of the herpes virus: Herpes simplex virus, or oral herpes, Epstein-Barr virus, Varicella infection, which causes chickenpox and herpes zoster that results in shingles.

'At least four (Epstein Barr virus- EBV, Varicella zoster virus- VZV, Cytomegalovirus– CMV, and Herpes simplex virus 1 -HSV1) of the eight known human Herpesviruses are common life-long infections humans have shown to reactivated due to space flight,' NASA said.

'The fact that space flight is known to increase the frequency and duration of Herpesvirus reactivation sets up a biological environment for these reactivating and replicating viruses to mutate.'

Researchers will collect and analyze saliva and urine samples of each astronaut involved in the study before they set out for space.

Then 'deep sequence analysis' will be performed on the samples before, during and after astronauts return from the mission.

The mutation frequency presented in the samples will also be analyzed during each of those times.

And the final step will be to compile all the data and determine whether the overall diversity of the viruses in each of the samples before during and after and the 'mutation frequency present in the samples before, during, and after space flight'.

Researchers will collect and analyze saliva and urine samples of each astronaut involved in the study before they set out for space.

In 2012, Nasa published an article explaining why so many astronauts suffer from shingles after they travel into space.

'Eight herpes viruses may reside in the human body, and virtually all of us are infected by one or more of these viruses,' reported the article.

'The herpes viruses are already present in astronauts, as they are in at least 95 percent of the general adult population worldwide.'

'So measuring the appearance of herpes viruses in astronaut body fluids serves as a much-needed immune biomarker.'

An early detection for shingles is already being used by Nasa, in order to help astronauts avoid the painful effects of the virus before it resurfaces, according to the article.

The study is underway and will continue until May 2018, but no news of results have been published.";Nasa's $80,000 HERPES study to find out why virus is more aggressive in space;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc2NpZW5jZXRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS0zNDIwMTI5L05hc2Etcy04MC0wMDAtSEVSUEVTLXN0dWR5LUFzdHJvbmF1dHMtdW5kZXJnby10ZXN0aW5nLXZpcnVzLWFnZ3Jlc3NpdmUtc3BhY2UuaHRtbNIBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvc2NpZW5jZXRlY2gvYXJ0aWNsZS0zNDIwMTI5L2FtcC9OYXNhLXMtODAtMDAwLUhFUlBFUy1zdHVkeS1Bc3Ryb25hdXRzLXVuZGVyZ28tdGVzdGluZy12aXJ1cy1hZ2dyZXNzaXZlLXNwYWNlLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/01/28/00/30A5D51B00000578-0-image-a-39_1453940898595.jpg;01/28/2016;"[{'sent': 'on four different types of the herpes virus\n\nEffects of space on mutation rate and diversity of human persistent viruses\n\nNasa has received grants and contracts for $80,000 to investigate what effects space travel has on herpes.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['four'], 'ORG': ['Nasa'], 'MONEY': ['80,000']}}, {'sent': ""The goal of this study will be to determine the changes in the genomic and mutational diversity that is present in the Herpesvirus virome present in astronaut saliva and urine samples collected before, during, and after space flight,' said Nasa.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Nasa']}}, {'sent': 'Nasa will be studying the effects of space travel on the herpes virus.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Nasa']}}, {'sent': ': Pictured, a Light micrograph of human skin cells infected with Herpes Simplex viruses, at a magnification of x80.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Herpes Simplex']}}, {'sent': 'Epstein Barr virus: Also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a member of the herpes virus family and is spread bodily fluids, mainly saliva.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Epstein Barr'], 'CARDINAL': ['4']}}, {'sent': 'Can cause genital herpes, but most cases of genital herpes are caused by herpes type 2.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['2']}}, {'sent': 'In HSV-2, the infected person may have sores around the genitals or rectum.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['HSV-2']}}, {'sent': ""Nasa has been given a few grants and contrast to use a researcher facility at the University of Florida to understand the 'effect of spaceflight on herpseviros genome stability and diversity', reported The Washington Free Beacon.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Washington Free Beacon', 'Nasa', 'the University of Florida']}}, {'sent': 'And last month, the organization was awarded an additional $15,000 for the study.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['an additional $15,000']}}, {'sent': ""Ground subjects will serve as the control group providing saliva and urine samples pre-flight and post-flight during the same schedule as the astronauts,' explained Nasa.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Nasa']}}, {'sent': 'The study will focuse on four different types of the herpes virus: Herpes simplex virus, or oral herpes, Epstein-Barr virus,', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['four'], 'PERSON': ['Epstein-Barr']}}, {'sent': ""'At least four"", 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['At least four']}}, {'sent': '(Epstein Barr virus- EBV, Varicella zoster', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Epstein Barr']}}, {'sent': 'VZV, Cytomegalovirus– CMV, and Herpes simplex virus 1', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Herpes']}}, {'sent': '-HSV1) of the eight known human Herpesviruses', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['eight']}}, {'sent': ""are common life-long infections humans have shown to reactivated due to space flight,' NASA said.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['NASA']}}, {'sent': 'In 2012, Nasa published an article explaining why so many astronauts suffer from shingles after they travel into space.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Nasa']}}, {'sent': ""Eight herpes viruses may reside in the human body, and virtually all of us are infected by one or more of these viruses,' reported the article.\n\n"", 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Eight', 'one']}}, {'sent': 'An early detection for shingles is already being used by Nasa, in order to help astronauts avoid the painful effects of the virus before it resurfaces, according to the article.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Nasa']}}]"
@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"An unusual species of waterfowl, adorned with pink head feathers was last seen in the wild in India in 1949. Until recently, however, researchers were unsure how the extinct species - Rhodonessa caryophyllacea - got its vivid plumage.

In the latest study, Daniel Thomas of Massey University in New Zealand and Helen James of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History used a taxidermied specimen from the Smithsonian's collection to unravel the mystery. They used a non-destructive technique known as Raman spectroscopy, which allowed them to thoroughly investigate the bird's feathers without needing to pluck or otherwise damage them - this is rather important when examining an extinct or rare creature.

Their analysis ultimately revealed the Pink-headed Duck used the same organic pigments - carotenoids - as flamingos and cardinals to produce their pink feathers. (Scroll to read more...)

Interestingly, however, carotenoids are rather rare among gamebirds. In fact, the only place carotenoids have previously been found in the feathers of a duck is along tiny ear spots of an Australian species known as Malacorhynchus membranaceus, which is otherwise black, brown, and white.

Their spectroscopy results also suggest that the plumage of the two ducks may even contain the same highly specific type of carotenoid - but since the two are only distantly related, they would have evolved their pink feathers independently, researchers say.

""Working with the Pink-headed Duck specimen was an incredible privilege,"" Thomas said in a statement. ""While the extinction of the Pink-headed Duck has not been explicitly confirmed, it has sadly not been seen alive now for many decades.""

When it was alive, the Pink-headed Duck thrived in the Gangetic plains of India and Bangladesh.

""The duck specimen was a physical and somber reminder of extinction, but I was grateful that the study skin had been preserved in the collections at the Smithsonian Institution,"" Thomas continued. ""This gave us an opportunity to make new natural history discoveries that emphasize the value of other living species.""

However, some parts of the bird's vivid plumage remains a mystery.

""We do not yet know which type of the forty or so carotenoid pigments makes Pink-headed Ducks pink -- but our ability to detect this using the Raman technique is improving, so further insights may be just around the corner,"" Dr. Mary Caswell Stoddard, an expert on bird coloration from Harvard University, added.

Their study was recently published in The Auk: Ornithological Advances.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Editor’s note: A previous version of this article said that the Great Indian Bustard was extinct, rather than critically endangered, and that the main cause of extinction of the other species was desertification. After clarifying with the Zoological Survey of India Director Kailash Chandra, we have updated our piece to reflect the findings. VICE regrets the error.

Although human actions are the ones primarily responsible for the effects of climate change, the threat of extinction isn’t just coming for our kind. Researchers at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD COP 14) have said that if desertification—where fertile land degrades significantly as a result of deforestation and agricultural practices—and improper use of land continue, critically endangered species could become extinct.





While some animal species like the Asiatic Cheetah and the pink-headed duck have been extinct for decades, mainly due to human activities like hunting, habitat destruction and deforestation, others that are on the verge of extinction now face the same threat.

“Species like the Great Indian Bustard, which only has about 150 of its population left, are critically endangered, and if land is not managed properly, desertification could be one of the reasons they become extinct,” Kailash Chandra, Director of the Zoological Survey of India, told VICE.

At the conference, Chandra mentioned that they had a database of more than 5.6 million specimens, collected from all over India and also from the neighbouring countries before independence, and said that, “They give a lot of information about how things have changed in more than 100 years. If you see their distribution in geo-special platforms, you'll realise how much changes have occurred because of the impact of deforestation and desertification.”





Chandra pointed out that even the use of insecticides pesticides, conversion of forest to agricultural land, industries and chemicals, and indiscriminate chopping of nature in the name of development (we’re looking at you, Aarey authorities), are responsible for triggering this deadly desertification. This doesn’t mean development must come to a screeching halt, but rather stresses the need to regulate such practices and minimise the damage done to the environment. He also said that such degradation doesn’t just threaten the survival of animals, but also that of humans and other microscopic beings.

""The entire food chain is affected due to this,"" says Chandra, stressing that a lot of land in India continues to degrade, with more than 30 percent of its land resources being affected by over-cultivation, soil erosion and depletion of wetlands.

What’s even more worrying is that India isn’t the only one having aridity issues. At the conference held in Greater Noida from September 2 to September 13, more than 196 countries and 94 environment ministers got together to acknowledge this crucial issue and work towards conserving the environment, especially in terms land management.

In fact, a recent UN report estimates that over a million plant and animal species are at risk, especially iconic endangered ones because of reasons ranging from pollution to overfishing, meaning that it’s all happening as a result of human activities. It also pointed out that ecosystems such as coral reefs and mangroves that protect the surrounding area from hurricanes, and wetlands that absorb water to reduce flooding, have declined dramatically, which is why natural disasters are now being increasingly reported. Apparently it’s not too late to unfuck the planet but we have to act now by incentivising the protection of natural resources and shift our development focus to nature-based planning.

At the conference last weekend, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a speech promising cooperation in addressing climate change and land degradation, while the other ministers present are expected to announce their targets for land restoration soon and unilaterally agree on ways to deal with threats like forced migration, sand and dust storms, droughts and water crises.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"It was 1813, when John James Audubon, the renowned American bird painter who created ‘The Birds of America’ had this amazing experience while riding to Louisville, Kentucky. Along the 55-mile journey all Audubon could see was a sky eclipsed with billions of birds. They were flying even after he reached his destination and continued flying for the next three days. “The light of noon-day was obscured as by an eclipse, the dung fell in spots, not unlike melting flakes of snow; and the continued buzz of the wings had a tendency to lull my senses to repose,"" he later wrote.

The bird that Audubon saw that day was the grey-blue winged passenger pigeon. It was one of the commonest birds in North America when Audubon wrote about it. But after a century of Audubon’s delightful encounter, the entire species of passenger pigeon was wiped out from earth, with the captive bird Martha, the last passenger pigeon, dying on 1 September 1914 in the Cincinnati Zoo. With her death Martha, became the symbol of the threat of extinction of species in the West. From teeming billions in the 1800s, with the largest documented nesting reported in Wisconsin in 1871, estimated 136 million breeding birds in 850 square miles of forest, the passenger pigeon became extinct. In 1860, a report stated that the flight of passenger pigeons near Toronto filled the sky for 14 hours straight and held perhaps 3.5 billion birds.

The last wild passenger pigeon was reported in 1900.

What seemed unimaginable, the extinction of a species found in abundance, happened due to widespread hunting and environmental destruction for development in North America in the second half of the 19th century. Martha symbolizes the ecological price North America paid for its development.

Something similar to the passenger pigeons in North America, in India, two resident species — the Himalayan Mountain Quail and the Pink-headed Duck have not been sighted for many decades. The last sighting of the Himalayan Mountain Quail was reported in 1876 in Nainital, Uttarakhand. As for the Pink-headed Duck, once found in abundance in the Gangetic plains, its last sighting was in 1949.

As India surges forward to become a global superpower, aspiring to be one with the West, is it also on th path of ecological destruction like the latter? A recent study by Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Yale University has identified 100 evolutionary distinct and globally endangered bird species from around the world. Of these 15 species occur in India whose habitats are under threat from unsustainable human activities. All the birds represent millions of years of unique evolutionary history. For example, the Great Indian Bustard, a bird once considered to be India’s National Bird, is on the brink of extinction. No more than 200 Great Indian Bustards exist in the wild today and conservationist evaluate that by 2030 the species will become extinct.

The question is how many more Marthas will be sacrificed at the altar of human development?

In 2013, the Supreme Court (SC) delivered a judgment on lions in India. The judgment directed that the wild lion population confined to Gir in Gujarat should be given a second habitat in Madhya Pradesh within six months. This was to ensure the population’s survival in the case of catastrophic events. The same judgment also said a separate proposal to “reintroduce” cheetahs to India should not go ahead as cheetahs from Africa, available for the reintroduction, were not the same as the Asiatic cheetah, which became locally extinct in India after Independence. The 2013 judgment is considered a landmark because it laid out several progressive tenets, including the “species-best-interest standard”—stressing that policy should implement what is best for a wild species rather than what was best for people.

Seven years later, the SC, in a January order, has said that cheetahs from Africa can be brought into India, an active move to associate cheetahs with India once again. This is interesting on two counts. First, the January judgment frames the introduction of the African cheetah as an “experimental basis in carefully chosen habitat”. This is new for conservation; an experiment which works towards de-extinction of a species gone for decades, rather than gradually setting up tones for “natural progression”. Second, the cheetah order comes in the shadow of the fact that the 2013 order on lions was never followed.

The 2013 judgment hinged on the alien-ness of the African cheetah, as the subspecies is different from the Asiatic one. The Asiatic cheetah is now found only in Iran, which has too few cheetahs to send any to India. The new judgement stresses that bringing African cheetahs will not be a “reintroduction”, but an introduction. This is a bringing forth rather than a bringing back; an act that seeks to address extinction through a next-best substitute. The cheetah is considered part of Indian culture; the word chitra standing for variegated patterns. It is also the first notably Indian animal that went extinct in recent memory (other animals that went extinct from India were the pink-headed duck and Sumatran rhino, but they were not as well-known as cheetahs.) Thus, the cheetah inhabits a cultural box which is outside of purely scientific conservation.

The question now is: What should be the species best-interest standard for cheetahs? Any move to address extinction is complex, and it becomes even more layered when it comes to large carnivores.

The cheetah should not be brought to India if certain issues are not addressed. Equally, bringing the cheetah to India can address problems typical to carnivore conservation and neglected habitat. The question of habitat is important as we have shown a historical skew towards protecting lush green forests. The cheetah is a creature of drier, more neglected spaces — grasslands and thorn forest. Not looking particularly green nor with dense canopy cover, both grasslands and thorn forest have been burnt, cleared, converted into industrial zones or decreed as wasted areas. Bringing the cheetah to India should have a minimum requirement of setting up a grassland policy. Sites in discussion for cheetah colonisation include Nauradehi sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh or the Shahgarh landscape near Jaisalmer; but we shouldn’t consider cheetah introduction as a tightly-managed “experiment” only in these sites.

Instead, a new grassland policy should address issues with grasslands sites specifically, and thorn forest more broadly. Grasslands need grazing policies and protection against conversion; and thorn forests need protection from being mined or sold.

Both grasslands and thorn forests are legitimate, living ecosystems with iconic species such as the Great Indian Bustard, caracal and the Indian wolf but the fact that these species are declining is because their habitat is not valued.

Conserving cheetahs will also mean dealing with conflict with people outside and in protected areas. While the relatively small cheetah is unlikely to have negative encounters with people, it may eat livestock. The model of co-existence with a carnivore constantly needs innovation and fine tuning. Studies show that where authorities are responsive in compensating kills or damage, there is less conflict with carnivores. Creating effective and quick conflict-resolution models should benefit the Indian wolf which shares a similar habitat. We also need to strengthen responses to invasive threats like domestic dogs forming packs and attacking wildlife, particularly outside protected areas.

Some would say India should focus on the species it has; especially the ones that are in neglected areas like grasslands. Yet, if we admit that conservation is also cultural, bringing cheetahs to India — with a grassland policy and innovation in place — may be the shot of conservation optimism that grasslands and ‘degraded’ forests need. What we don’t need is patriotism through animals; but what we still do need are new ways of seeing places that don’t look impressive to us.

Scientists have found many links between Rusingoryx and hadrosaur dinosaurs -- particularly the large, hollow dome that makes a crest on top of the animal's skull. (Photo : Todd S. Marshall)

An extinct relative of the wildebeest boasted a trumpet-like nose similar to the strange hollow nasal crests of hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaurs, according to a new study. Researchers say this discovery offers ""a spectacular example"" of convergent evolution between two very distantly-related animals across tens of millions of years.

""The nasal dome is a completely new structure for mammals- it doesn't look like anything you could see in an animal that's alive today,"" Haley O'Brien, a paleophysiology student at Ohio University, Athens, said in a news release. ""The closest example would be hadrosaur dinosaurs with half-circle shaped crests that enclose the nasal passages themselves.""

The ancient wildebeest-like animals, Rusingoryx atopocranion, lived about 65 thousand years ago, during the late Pleistocene era. Duck-billed dinosaurs, Lambeosaurine hadrosaurs, lived closer to 65 million years ago, during the late Cretaceous. Yet, both animals evolved the same strange nose – which developed the same way as the animals grew from juveniles to adults.

""When I first saw the complete skulls, I was blown away,"" vertebrate paleontologist David C. Evans, who was not part of the study, writes in an email to The Christian Science Monitor. ""The resemblance between Rusingoryx and some hollow-crested dinosaurs in the form of their nasal structures is truly striking, and there are clear parallels in how they evolved and grew. Both groups elongated their noses to such a degree that they evolved highly domed skulls to house their nasal passages on top of their heads, above their eyes.""

Based on an anatomical analysis and acoustical modeling, researchers believe the trumpet-like nasal tube may have allowed Rusingoryx to deepen its normal vocal calls and communicate with others across fairly large distances. In fact, the animals might have been able to call at levels very close to infrasound, such that other animals may not have been able to hear individuals in the herd calling back and forth to each other.

""Vocalizations can alert predators, and moving their calls into a new frequency could have made communication safer,"" O'Brien added. ""On top of this, we know that [both] Rusingoryx and hadrosaurs were consummate herbivores, each having their own highly specialized teeth. Their respective, remarkable dental specializations may have initiated changes in the lower jaw and cheek bones that ultimately led to the type of modification we see in the derived, crest-bearing forms.""

In future studies, researchers hope to learn what led to the once-thriving Rusingoryx's mass exit.

Their study was recently published in the journal Current Biology.

We often don't pay attention to the fact that our day-to-day existence is inextricably connected with the natural world, the resources it has to offer and the species that thrive on it. Our health, food, and security depend largely on biodiversity. From medical treatments to our daily food requirements, species plays a critical role. Species are a group of living organisms that are similar and can exchange genes or interbreed with each other. ""Species"" is the basic unit of taxonomy used to classify every known organism into. The number of species matters — considerably — to the health of ecosystems, and the world at large.

At a very basic level of interconnectivity, we see this in the medicines that we use, a large portion of it derived from plants species, and more than a third of food crops dependant on pollination by insects. According to the Living Planet Report 2018 (LPR) it is estimated that globally nature provides services worth around USD 125 trillion a year! With a growing human population and increasingly consumerist society, a corresponding increase in primary productivity from trees, plants and marine organisms that convert the solar energy to food is a must. This is possible only if we protect the diversity of species in the world.

From the depth of the deepest oceans to the top of the highest mountains, life in the form of microbes, algae, fungi and arthropods to large mammals, species can be found in nearly every corner of our planet. The species composition on our planet includes 7.3 percent animals, 7.4 percent fungi, 0.02 percent plants, 7.3 percent protists, and a whopping 78 percent bacteria, according to research conducted by Larsen et al. (2017). Every species has a role to play in maintaining a balance in the natural world.

Plant species help harness the power of the sun and fix carbon through a process called photosynthesis. It is at the base of the food chain for other life forms and plants are, therefore, known as primary producers. Any change in plant species’ composition and richness affect this basic requirement. One species differs from the other in the way they use natural resources, physical and biological and the way they respond to environmental issues that threaten their basic existence.

What are some of the threats to species?

The decline of species has been phenomenal in recent times. According to the LPR 2018, terrestrial animal and marine animal populations have fallen by 40 percent since 1970. Freshwater ecosystems lost 75 percent of their biodiversity in 1970. Insect populations have declined by 75 percent too, and coral reefs have been damaged beyond repair. What poses a grim challenge to food security is that there have been dramatic reductions in pollinator species like bees, with pollinators helping produce 35 percent of crops globally. Soil biodiversity has also seen a drastic reduction, which affects multiple ecosystem services.

The challenge with species extinction is that it is irreversible. Once a species is extinct from the face of the Earth, there is almost no way to bring them back. Species extinction occurs when a particular species’ numbers decline drastically due to habitat loss, habitat degradation, natural calamity or overexploitation of the species by human beings. In recent years, a tragic example of extinction due to hunting is that of the Northern white rhino in Africa. As of March 2018, only two female northern white rhinos are left in a private conservancy in Kenya. This near extinction has been caused by poaching of this species for rhino horn.

Two species that went extinct from India in the last century include the Asiatic cheetah and the pink-headed duck, a bird that was seen in this country last in 1950. In the present century, another species of bird, that is slowly moving towards a bleak future is the great Indian Bustard. Found in western parts of India and adjoining regions of Pakistan, the global population of the species today stands at less than two hundred. Even with such low numbers, every day there is a continuous fear of more of these birds dying due to anthropogenic pressures like electrocution from power transmission lines that crisscross its habitat. This kind of species loss is irreversible.

One of the biggest reasons that could be attributed to species’ loss, therefore, is the loss or destruction of its habitats. Large scale land use change like forests being destroyed due to either infrastructural developments like roads and highways or even agriculture and urbanisation, and sea beds being drilled for oil have led to large patches of wildlife habitats being wiped out.

Fragmented habitats isolate species populations, which affects their long-term survival due to inbreeding. Large territorial animals are affected mostly by this, where their habitats are fragmented and even the interconnecting corridors are blocked or chocked due to land use change that threatens species survival. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) states that the rapid loss of species that is happening now is estimated to be between 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than the expected natural extinction rate; and unlike the historical mass extinction events, human populations are entirely responsible for the current phenomenon of extinction.

The rate of species extinctions occurring across the planet is high and climate change and other anthropogenic pressures like land use change and related habitat fragmentation are only aggravating this loss. Climate change adaptation and mitigation thus becomes essential to halt species loss, or even to maintain species diversity.

The way forward for species & landscape conservation

With studies showing a 60 percent decline in wildlife populations in about four decades, it is time that we need to collectively work to halt this decline of different species which is essential for the well-being of human populations. It is nature and her inhabitants that have provided everything to build a modern human society. Recent research has shown the importance of the natural world for our health, wealth, food and security. Landscape-level conservation of species helps in slow down the trend provided, all actors are working with equal dedication and in tandem. Protection of species and their natural habitats need to be a priority for all stakeholders to build a world in which humans live in harmony with nature.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Hope is the thing with feathers, poet Emily Dickinson wrote. For Richard Thorns, the feathers are pink.

Thorns' hope? To prove that a colorful duck is not extinct. This week, he launches a seventh expedition into the inaccessible wilds of Myanmar to search for the pink-headed duck that hasn't been seen alive since 1949, and that was in India. No one has seen the bird alive in Myanmar in more than a century.

Thorns, a British writer who quit his shop clerk job 20 years ago after reading about the pink-headed duck in the book ""Vanishing Birds,"" has spent $20,000 of his own money on previous fruitless trips. His birder brother called him mad.

""I could have had a lot of nice things,"" the 53-year-old said. ""I don't want nice things. I want to see a pink-headed duck.""

This time, he is backed by the Global Wildlife Conservation group, which launched a hunt for ""lost species"" — 25 quirky and elusive plants and animals beginning with the duck. A sports optic company and cheesemaking company are also helping pay.

Thorns and three others plan to head to the wetlands north of the vast Indawgyi Lake during the rainy season where they believe they have a better chance of spotting the duck. And Thorn thinks he has a secret weapon: elephants.

He used canoes in the past and thinks he probably spooked the shy birds. Now he plans to bring elephants stomping through the wetlands.

""Clearly a bird isn't going to hunker down if there are 2-ton elephants,"" said Thorn.

As crazy as it may seem, Thorns may be onto something, said ornithologist Kevin McGowan at Cornell University who isn't part of the expedition.

""Fairly regularly birds get rediscovered,"" says McGowan, who has gone on unsuccessful expeditions for the ivory-billed woodpecker. ""We don't see all the world that is in front of our eyes.""

A Cornell student found Bermuda petrels, rare seabirds thought to be extinct for 300 years. Other rediscovered animals include a crow species in Asia and a nocturnal parrot in Australia. These birds survive by not being noticed ""so what's your certainty that it's gone?"" said McGowan.

One thing that keeps Thorns going is the thought that someone else might find the pink-headed duck first.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"(Newser) – If there's anywhere you'll see a punk rocker with a ""multicolored mohawk,"" New York City would be the place. But the Mandarin duck that's been hanging out in Central Park since mid-October is another story entirely. The New York Times reports the creature with brilliantly hued plumage was first spotted Oct. 10 and has since gone viral, with spectators all vying for pictures of an animal usually seen only in East Asia. For now, the duck's origins remain a mystery: None of the city's zoos have this type of duck missing from the roster, and it's illegal in NYC to keep a duck as a pet. That means the duck perhaps escaped from, say, an owner in New Jersey and made its way to the city, or maybe the owner itself got sick of the duck and unceremoniously left it and ran.

Either way, the duck has been a huge hit. ""It's just an incredible gift to New York,"" one birder tells CBS New York. Avian experts believe that based on its feeding habits—it likes bugs and vegetation skimmed from the water's surface—the duck should be able to survive just fine in the Big Apple, and park officials say they're just going to let it be unless it becomes injured. It already appears to have made friends with the park's mallards.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The future seems to be bleak for the Najafgarh jheel, and it’s all because of governmental apathy. The Delhi government and the Haryana government are apparently not much bothered about the restoration of the lake — a wetland vital for the revival of the water table in Gurgaon and South Delhi.

While the Delhi government plainly says that the lake does not exist anymore within the boundary of the Capital, the Haryana government is completely indifferent to the matter.

About seven months back the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) had filed a petition before the National Green Tribal, seeking direction to the governments of Delhi and Haryana to take necessary steps for the lake’s revival.

The NGO had previously presented a blueprint for the revival of the lake, and the plan was accepted by the two state governments.

However, beyond that no action was initiated by the governments for actual revival of the wetland.

About half of the jheel once existed within Delhi’s boundary. But replying to the petition, the Delhi government said, “no such water body exists” at the marked location now.

On its part, the Haryana government did not even bother to send a counsel to represent itself in six successive hearings before the National Green Tribunal.

The next date of hearing before the Tribunal is on April 13.

Najafgarh jheel, another name for Sahibi river, tributary of river Yamuna, once occupied more than 300 square kilometres of area in southwest Delhi.

It finds a mention in the Delhi Gazetteer of 1883, and the Survey of India Map of 1911. Before Independence it used to be a rich habitat for birds and other wildlife, often visited by the British parties for hunting.

Allan Octavian Hume, the British ornithologist, reported sightings of birds like the Pink-headed Duck and Siberian Crane here.

These birds are not sighted in the Indian subcontinent anymore.

After the 1960s, the Flood Control Department of Delhi kept widening the Najafgarh drain on the pretext of saving Delhi from floods, and eventually drained the Najafgarh jheel completely.

INTACH had previously presented elaborate blueprints for the revival of the lake, recommending use of floodwaters from the Kakraula regulator and treated effluents from the Gurgaon sewage treatment plant.

These recommendations were accepted by both the Delhi and Haryana governments, but not acted upon.

INTACH’S petition now prays for directions to the two concerned state governments to take steps to restore the lake to its natural condition.

In a two-page affidavit to National Green Tribunal, the Delhi government has said: “No jheel exists on the land pointed out by INTACH.

""There is habitation on the said site which will be difficult to remove. It will also be difficult to demarcate the original lake land. While there is little water left on the Haryana side, there is nothing within the Delhi boundary.”

Manu Bhatnagar, principal director of INTACH’s Natural Heritage Division, said: “The lake, if revived, would provide a water reservoir of approximately 10 million cusec metre.";Najafgarh jheel wiped

Expeditions will delve into the wild, looking for species that haven’t been seen for at least a decade.

Brian Owens, Contributor

(Inside Science) -- Somewhere deep in the remote and largely inaccessible wetlands of northern Myanmar, Richard Thorns hopes to find a ghost. This fall, the ambulance driver and amateur ornithologist plans to leave his home in Crowborough, England to launch his seventh expedition in search of the elusive -- and quite possibly extinct -- pink-headed duck.

The striking but shy bird was always a rare sight in the marshes of India, Bangladesh and Myanmar, and little is known about its behavior and habits. Its large, dark brown body, with characteristic pink plumage adorning its head and neck, has not been conclusively seen in the wild since 1949. But Thorns has made it his personal mission to prove that the bird is still out there.

Thorns was working in a department store when a chance encounter with the story of the pink-headed duck in a library book captured his imagination nearly 20 years ago. “There wasn't a lot going on in my life career-wise or ambition-wise then,” he said. “When I read that book, I decided I didn't want to be shop assistant anymore. I wanted to find the pink-headed duck.”

In 2009, after years of planning and saving money, Thorns made his first trip to Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country formerly known as Burma, which for years has suffered from ethnic strife and from 1962 until 2011 was ruled by the military. “I flew in naive,” Thorns said. “I didn't realize so much of [the country] was so fiercely guarded and locked down.”

With help from Myanmar's Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association, he found a promising location to begin his quest, along the Irrawaddy River north of the town of Bhamo in Kachin State. The search was filled with difficulties -- at one point, he and his unlicensed local guide learned that the authorities were looking for them, and had to sneak back into the village after dark. Still, Thorns persisted, embarking on five more expeditions in the subsequent years.

While Thorns has never spotted his quarry on any of his trips, he has encountered several locals who claimed to have seen the ducks in the wild. So he is optimistic about his chances on the upcoming trip. He believes the closed nature of the country favors the bird’s survival, since areas remain where few people are allowed to travel.

For his seventh duck hunt, Thorns has devised a new plan of attack. And he has the backing of a new global project to seek out and protect “lost species.”

Lost and found

The pink-headed duck is just one of many species that have gone AWOL, with no definitive proof whether they are extinct or still alive. In an effort to find some of the missing and draw attention to their stories, Global Wildlife Conservation, an Austin, Texas-based environmental group, has launched the “Search for Lost Species” -- a worldwide hunt for animals and plants that haven't been seen for years.

GWC spent almost a year consulting conservation specialists from around the world on which lost species they would most like to see found. Their initial list included more than 1,200 options. “It wasn't easy to choose,” said Robin Moore, a conservation biologist based in Austin and the project's leader.

They eventually narrowed it down to the 25 “most wanted” species: 10 mammals, three birds, three reptiles, three fish, two amphibians, one insect, one crustacean, one coral and one plant.

“The top 25 is a way to capture the public's imagination,” said Moore. “They are fascinated by the mystery surrounding them.”

Some choices were a no-brainer -- the duck, for example, was nominated multiple times. Others had been missing for an impressive amount of time, like the Himalayan Quail, which has not been seen for 141 years. Or they were extra compelling mysteries, like the Bullneck Seahorse, which has never been spotted alive in the wild and was last collected, perhaps by accident in a fishing net, in 1996.

In building the list, GWC worked to ensure that it included not only a wide variety of animals, but also a wide geographic spread covering many types of habitat and places where there are local partners who can help lead the search.

GWC has some experience with this type of project. In 2010, the group launched the “Search for Lost Frogs” in partnership with Arlington, Virginia-based Conservation International, aimed at finding the top 10 missing amphibians. Within the first year they had rediscovered three -- including one from Borneo that hadn't been seen for more than 100 years, and one in Israel that had been declared extinct after 55 years without a sighting.

They learned from those successes that the excitement that comes with a species rediscovery can provide a big boost for their work, attracting attention and money for ongoing preservation efforts. “The stories it generates can create these emblems of hope and resilience,” said Moore. “People are more likely to engage with conservation if it's not always doom and gloom.”

There is a debate in the conservation community over whether high-profile, expensive campaigns focused on a few flagship species -- especially ones that may no longer exist -- are the best use of scarce resources. Ernest Small, a botanist with the Canadian department of agriculture in Ottawa who has written about conservation's fixation on flagship species, said he finds the lost species idea a bit gimmicky. “Now I don't mind gimmicks, but as ideas go this one seems a bit far out,” he said.

He added that by focusing on large, attractive animals conservationists lose an opportunity to educate the public and politicians about the importance of preserving habitats and planetary ecosystems -- though he admitted that is a tough sell at the best of times. “[Focusing on big animals] is probably the best we can do” to get people's attention, he said.

He wonders, then, if this collection of mostly small creatures that live in far-flung corners of the globe will be successful at getting donors in the Western world to open their wallets. “People like to support things that are big and exciting, like elephants, or that live close to home, like monarch butterflies,” he said.

Jean-Christophe Vié, deputy director of the species program at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature in Gland, Switzerland, is a big believer in the power of an individual species' story to get through to the public. “We need stories to reconnect people to nature,” he said. “We're not going to reconnect to them with fuzzy concepts like carbon sequestration and ecosystem services.”

But finding a lost species is only the first step, warns Vié. The discovery can give the impression that perhaps the species is not in as much trouble as thought -- when in fact it is likely highly vulnerable, and will require protection.

“Finding one is, in itself, not that useful,” said Vié. “Finding it and doing something about recovery, that is interesting.”

Small agrees. “If they find one, what are they going to do? These species are really at the brink, it will be hard to keep them going,” he said.

Moore said GWC's commitment to a species will not end with rediscovery. They will also work to identify the threats it faces, and to preserve the habitat. During the frog search, for example, they helped to set up the first private nature preserve in Haiti to protect the six lost and new species of frog they found. Efforts like this have the added benefit of protecting everything else that lives nearby, noted Moore.

For both the frog and new lost species project, GWC was careful to choose species that represent areas that are important to protect, he said.

GWC is currently raising funds to support expeditions, and finding local partners that can help with the search and take the lead for ongoing conservation efforts. Thorns' duck hunt this fall will be one of the first, followed by an expedition to Indonesia early next year by nature photographer Clay Bolt in search of Wallace's Giant Bee -- the world's biggest bee, originally described by famed naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858. It was not seen again until 1981, and hasn't been seen since.

All of the searches are probably pretty long shots, said Moore. But there are signs of hope. Local reports from Indonesia in 2007 provide some evidence for the survival of Attenborough's Long-beaked Echidna, named after naturalist David Attenborough and missing for 56 years. And though the Fernandina Galápagos Tortoise hasn't been seen since 1906, a 1964 expedition found possible droppings of the long-lived reptile, as well as cactuses that appeared to have been chewed by a tortoise. That search in particular fascinates Moore. “How do you lose a giant tortoise on an island?” he asked.

Bolt, for his part, is cautiously optimistic for his bee hunt. The bee's habitat on a remote Indonesian island chain seems to be mostly intact, and he has been in touch with the 1981 team to learn about where and how to look. “It's certainly a vulnerable species, but most likely it's only missing because no one has gone looking for it,” he said.

Heart of duckness

Moore thinks the pink-headed duck is one of the project's more speculative efforts. “Lots of people have been looking for it quite intensively for a long time, so the odds are extremely long,” he said. “But it's high-risk, high-reward. If we were to find it, it would be absolutely incredible.”

Thorns, though, figures he might be on the verge of a breakthrough. He has a theory that the ducks migrate seasonally within Myanmar, living in the wetlands of Kachin State during the wet season, then moving somewhere else during the dry season -- perhaps one of the numerous totally restricted military areas. Since most searches by ornithologists have been conducted during the dry season, it's possible the ducks have simply been elsewhere.

“No one is looking in the wet season. The only people who have described seeing it to me have been fishermen or farmers, locals who are there year-round. So it must migrate somewhere no one is allowed to be,” he said. “I'm not thinking like a birdwatcher, but a cryptozoologist,” he said, referring to people who aim to prove the existence of creatures from folklore, like Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster.

So on this trip, accompanied by the writer Errol Fuller and photographer John Hodges, Thorns will search the wetlands around Indawgyi Lake at the tail end of the wet season, when any ducklings will have fledged but should still be hanging around the nest.

And he's changing his search technique. Previous trips have involved paddling about in boats, which can only gently nose into the dense elephant grass where the birds nest. The retiring ducks, if they were there, likely just hunkered down and waited for the boat to move on, Thorns thinks. So this time he and his companions will use elephants to ride right through the grassy swamps, hoping to flush the birds out.

“We're replicating the techniques of the British Raj,” he said. India's colonial rulers used to spot -- and shoot -- the ducks while hunting tigers from elephant-back in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Thorns said the birds are probably used to wild elephants in that area, so should not be unduly stressed by the search. “We might have to almost be on top of them before they break cover,” he said.

With his new theory and new search plan ready, Thorns has high hopes that this trip will be the one that makes history. “I think I can almost say that the search is over,” he said.

If the search for the duck, or any of the other most wanted species, indeed proves successful, it will be a huge boon for conservation efforts, said Moore. And it will provide an opportunity for us to do a better job of protecting these fascinating species this time around. “If we give them a second chance, they can surprise us,” he said.";Nature's Most

Winged Fire

Author: Valmik Thapar

Publishers: Aleph

Pages: 486 (Hardcover)

Price: 2,295

While every sixth person alive is Indian, every sixth species of bird is found in India. The third volume in a series edited by Valmik Thapar, Winged Fire, is devoted to the airborne sixth, a community about 1,400 species strong. Serious birders may scorn this book, though, since it contains scrumptious pictures but none of the arcana of field guides, such as how to tell bushchats from stonechats by their superciliaries or coverts, or similar.

To expect a real birder to appreciate this book is like expecting a Shakespearean scholar to curl up with a Mickey Spillane. But the laity with deep pockets would find this collection an enjoyable introduction to the simple pleasures of birdwatching, with vibrant photography and classical colour plates. The liveliest image is a stop-action photograph by Ramki Sreenivasan of the extremely rare Bengal florican taking flight and descending.

Some of the accounts accompanying the pictures explain why birds have been quitting nature to populate picture books — rampant hunting. In 1949, Monica Martin wrote of tables groaning under the weight of exotic meats in the shooting season — roast peacock in such abundance that after a month, everything but the breast went to the servants, partridge, junglefowl (she calls it “wild chicken”) and green pigeon stuffed with olives, in port wine sauce.

Thapar’s accent is on the social rather than the ornithological. Frank B Simson’s little piece on the “rare pink-headed duck of Purneah” ends with the approved practice for catching them for the table. Men waded into their midst while hiding their faces in earthen pots, then grabbed the stupid, trusting creatures by the legs. There are also extracts about murgabaazi (cockfighting, by Pran Nevile) and ishqbazi, a term coined by Akbar for pigeon fancying, according to Abu’l Fazl. The imperial sport degenerated to kabootarbazi in our era, and the word now signifies risky speculation.

Fazl delves into the technicalities of feeding hawks in imperial Fatehpur Sikri: “In Kashmir and in the aviaries of Indian amateurs, the birds are generally fed once a day; but at Court they are fed twice.” They got meat for lunch and about half a dozen sparrows for dinner. Did the sparrow extinction wave we see today begin in Mughal times, on the dietary prescription of a monarch?

But there is something cock-eyed about the meticulous bibliography of this book. Fazl’s quotation is dated to 1871, when the man had been in the grave for 269 years. Chronologically, the closest translation is that of H Blochmann and Col HS Jarrett, which was printed by the Asiatic Society at Calcutta’s Baptist Mission Press two years later, in 1873. Dating sources to the lifetime of the author is more indicative than quoting the particular edition one has read. It is creepy to find Salim Ali writing about village waterfowl in 2008, from beyond the veil.

Never mind, here’s another excellent sideshow: Mrs Murray Mitchell writes in 1876 about a huge adjutant bird pacing her boundary wall in Calcutta, to which an urchin hurls a live kitten, which vanishes into its bag-like gizzard. She reports that a fine of Rs 50 is imposed on those who kill these enormous scavengers. An early green tax, or an English nod to the Indian notion that adjutants house the souls of Brahmins?

Lest you think this is a compendium of Mughal and Raj accounts, Indian voices like I Allan Sealy, Khushwant Singh, Ruskin Bond and Bulbul Sharma are lively presences in these pages.

Thapar’s own introduction is a personal account recalling his childhood in Delhi. The spacious, gracious Delhi of half a century before the crowded, polluted concrete jungle, when every garden came with a mandatory pair of hoopoes on the lawn and a pair of red-vented bulbuls in the pomegranate tree. After that homely initiation, Delhi’s children traditionally made first contact with the wild in Bharatpur, teeming with painted storks, cormorants and darters. And then, the world was their hide.

But soft, it is dawn. And perched on a TV cable slinging earthwards past my apartment window is a grey hornbill, looking strangely postnuclear as always. India’s birdscape may be a shadow of its former raucous, robust self, but our birds still have the element of surprise.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"This is the MYANMAR GOLD LIST by Sampan Travel.





This is our edit of the most exciting, most extraordinary people, places and initiatives in Myanmar travel. The sights, the smells, the movements. The game-changers and the go-getters.The innovators, the pioneers. The trend-setters going further, diving deeper, and helping anyone travel better through Myanmar.

Now is not the time to travel. But now can be the time to plan. The time to wish and to daydream.

So while you’re at home, thinking about travel, have a look at what these people are doing. Right now you can’t follow them in real life so go follow them online: read about them, post about them, share, tweet, and pin. Fire them a message to ask them a question or just to say “Hey! What you’re doing is awesome!”





Bookmark this page; tear it out, fold it up and keep it somewhere secure. And then when it is safe to do so, strap on your boots … and go travelling once more.

The MYANMAR GOLD LIST will look at the Game Changers, the Trends, the Hotels and the Activities. But before any of that, we are looking at The Destinations.

The Highlands: Nagaland and Mogok

Since the first missionaries and privateers arrived on the shores of Burma tales of the head-hunters of Nagaland have thrilled the drawing rooms of Europe. The British fought them and eventually managed to subdue most of the tribes but the fierce traditions of Naga – the tattoos, the drums, the head dresses – endured.

The Naga fought with the British in the Second World War and the young Tommies from the Yorkshire Dales arriving in Kohima and Imphal found themselves guided through the jungle by richly painted Naga warriors with titanic spears.

Most people visit Nagaland in January to see the dancing and festivities of Naga New Year. We recommend avoiding this time unless you have a yearning for crowds and forced jollyment. At another time of year, find a trusted local guide, rent a 4x4 and travel from Hkamti over the Chindwin River to Lahe. Trappings of the outside world such as shirts from the English Premier League are evident but you will also be offered novel specialties such as testicle of cockerel.

The cuisine is more prosaic in Mogok but in raucous restaurants such as Lu Do travellers can sample new tastes washed down with Black Shield and wedges of lime. Around the centre of the town bloom 172 cherry blossom trees and at the adjacent market travellers sit down for Mogok mee shay, steamed mustard leaf and freshly squeeze soy milk.

You must visit the ruby mines and the gem markets but don’t neglect other delights of the town such as the coffee plantations and the macadamia fields; the British Cemetery of the 1800s and the Agape church where young Lisu with earnest, stilted English strum Christian rock.

Go North: Indawgyi Lake and the Pink Headed Duck Café

The town of Lonton sits upon the western banks of Indawgyi, Myanmar’s largest lake. Indawgyi is not only larger than Inle but also much quieter. One of the most pleasant things to do at Inle is rent a kayak and paddle from village to village, stopping for tea in monasteries amongst indifferent cattle.

Indawgyi has long been a honey-spot for bird-watching. The most intrepid twitchers may be on the hunt for the elusive pink-headed duck, believed to have been extinct since the 1940s but rumored to still splash about somewhere in the marshes of Kachin State.

In honour of the duck, Face of Indawgyi are soon to be opening the Pink Headed Duck Café, before breaking ground on the region’s first eco-hotel.

Today, the most exciting hotel at Indawgyi is In Daw Mahar Guesthouse – an angular characterful dwelling with a large terrace stretching out onto the lake. Indawgyi Motel is a tidier option; Mother’s Home a cosier one. All are near to local restaurants serving Kachin honey and coffee from the hills.

Off-piste, on the beach: Gwa and Gaw Yan Gyi

Ueli and Arakan Nature Lodge put Gwa on the map for Yangonites seeking an alternative to the clipped resorts of Ngapali and the boozy vibes of Ngwe Saung Beach.

Arakan Nature Lodge is not so much a place to do things, but a place to be. An idyll to listen to the sounds of the sea and allow your mind to wander.

Other hotels are cropping up along this stretch of coastline. Lalay Lodge is situated just south of Thandwe in the village of Maung Shwe Lay. The staff are from the village, the cuisine from Rakhine State, and one of the hotel’s three dogs – Bro, Blaize and Wonky – are likely to join guests on their hike up to the adjacent hill to watch the sun set into the Bay of Bengal.

Further south still, on the other side of Ngwe Suang Beach is the Gaw Yan Gyi peninsula. It is possible to ride down by motorbike from Ngwe Saung or hire a boat. However most commonly travellers take the bus from Pathein. Arrive at dawn and arrange bikes to take you down the peninsula, through misty glades and to the twin beaches of Gwa Yan Gyi, one for fishing, the other for pleasure.

The Retro Come Backs: Pindaya and Pyin Oo Lwin

Pindaya and Pyin Oo Lwin are undergoing a renaissance.

Pindaya used to be promoted as just a day-trip from Inle. This is no longer the case. Better to stay a few nights, sleeping at Cottage House – aka La Maison de Pindaya - where the garden overflows with lavender and orchids and giant pinkpomelos, bulge and hang low from the trees. Each room has been designed with an exquisite aesthetic taste: the cushion covers are made with Pakokku fabric and the bed-side table books include titles like La Vallée des rubis and Un Françaisen Birmanie.

Pyin Oo Lwin was described by one unimpressed traveler in the 1950s as exaggeratively nationalistic and excessively dull. Its drizzle made it deserving of the moniker “Little England.”

The waxworks in the Aureum Palace are turning green and the European cemetery is in a further state of decrepitude. The Candacraig remains closed and, most likely, haunted.

But today, in the fields of The Croft Farm children can skip about filling little wicker baskets with plump strawberries. Coffee can be enjoyed from the faux windmill or saved for the delightful Pan Taw Win restaurant while making plans for day treks.

Akimomo Hotel with its Japanese spa is breathing fresh life into the hotel scene. Alternatively one can stay at The View, hiking down the crevasse to the plunge pool of the Anikasan Falls and at December Restaurant cows can be petted and guinea pigs cuddled while waiters and waitresses in oversized cowboy hats serve creamy milkshakes and oh-no khaoswe.

Once upon a time, a subspecies of giant tortoise lived on Fernandina, the least-explored island in the Galapagos.

In 1906, explorers with the California Academy of Sciences found one male Fernandina Galapagos tortoise — and killed it to preserve as a specimen. The next sign came in 1964, when an expedition to the island reported the presence of tortoise scat. An aerial survey in 2009 spotted something resembling a tortoise. But for all practical purposes, this reptile has been lost for 111 years.

Now the quest to find it — and two dozen other “lost species” — is about to be renewed. Global Wildlife Conservation, a Texas-based organization, is launching a global search for what it calls the top 25 “most wanted” animals (and one plant). None is officially extinct. But, collectively, the species have not been seen in more than 1,500 years.

The list, which was compiled in consultation with experts from the International Union for Conservation of Nature, includes a bat, a bee, a parakeet, a sea horse and a type of coral. The experts were asked to nominate species that had not been spotted in more than 10 years and had cultural significance. Species already declared extinct were not considered.

Most important, project lead Robin Moore said, was a “glimmer of hope,” for their rediscovery.

“We are in an extinction crisis, and I think people need to feel at least there’s some hope,” said Moore, a biologist and director of communications at GWC. “Hope is a more powerful motivator than despair.”

From an initial list of 1,200 nominations, the organization narrowed the list to what Moore called 25 “quirky, charismatic” poster species that, if they still exist, are found in 18 countries across the globe. It does not include species for which many people are already looking, Moore said, such as the ivory-billed woodpecker, a bird reported to have been seen in Arkansas in 2004 (although that sighting is in doubt).

Moore said the organization hopes to start expeditions in the late summer, after an initial effort to raise $500,000. The kind of search will vary, he said. Scientists might launch a two-week quest in the grasslands and swamps of Myanmar, also known as Burma, to look for the pink-headed duck, which has been “lost” for 68 years. Larger mammals, like the Wondiwoi tree kangaroo of Indonesia, might be best spotted with remote cameras. Talking to locals could be key to finding the scarlet harlequin frog in the cloud forest of Venezuela. Divers and vessels will be required for the search for Wellington’s solitary coral, which was abundant in some parts of the Galapagos until an El Niño in the early 1980s.

Moore has firsthand evidence this campaign could work. In 2010, when he was at Conservation International, he and colleagues launched “The Search For Lost Frogs,” which took scientists across the world in search of 10 missing frogs. Within a year, they had located three and rediscovered 12 others.

Species on the list include the Namdapha flying squirrel, which has been missing for 36 years. A single specimen collected in a national park in northeast India is the only evidence it ever existed.

The Syr Darya shovelnose sturgeon was last seen in the 1960s in Kazakhstan.

Despite vigorous searches for the pink-headed duck in Myanmar after unconfirmed sightings in 2006, it has remained elusive since it was last seen in 1949.

The Himalayan quail is the longest-missing species on the list. It was last seen in 1876.

The scarlet harlequin frog was last seen in 1990, but anecdotal reports suggest it could still live in a remote area scientists have not yet examined.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"For field biologists Mahesh Babu and Ganesh Pallela, it was a routine survey of marine biodiversity along River Godavari in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh when they spotted an unusual shark. It was no longer than three feet and had distinct black markings on its dorsal, pectoral and tail fins. Still, it was hard to pinpoint the exact species as minor morphological differences play a major role in identification. Not taking any chances, and with an imminent feeling that this was not a common sighting, the two asked Anil Mohapatra, a scientist from the Zoological Survey of India, for help. He came back with surprising results — the duo had spotted the critically endangered Pondicherry shark, last seen 39 years ago in India!

Unlike the Pondicherry shark, it would seem impossible to confuse the peacock spider aka the Gooty tarantula with any other arachnid. This peacock of the spider world is not only of a mammoth size but also has a noticeable blue lustre that makes it quite easy to spot. And yet, it took scientists 102 years to rediscover the tarantula after it was first spotted in 1899 in a railway timber yard. It looks like species such as these — the Pondicherry shark and the Gooty tarantula, the pink-headed duck and the Himalayan quail — have lied low, as if deliberately from prying human eyes, hardly observed or documented in the millions of years of earth’s existence. While remaining elusive could be a survival instinct, the changing character of the habitats and the ecosystems themselves could place them in more mortal danger than ever before if they continue to stay hidden.

Living in oblivion

There are many animals and plants in India, especially those that have been listed as endangered or critically endangered by the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which have also remained elusive for a very long period of time. The pink-headed duck was last seen in 1935 and then again claimed to have been spotted in 2009, but many believe it is already extinct. In 1987, the Zoological Survey of India received skin samples of the rare Malabar civet. Since then, the civet has not been seen. The Himalyan quail is a medium-sized bird belonging to the pheasant family, with distinctive red or yellow bill and legs, and prominent white spots around the eyes. It has a long covert tail which is longer than most other quails. However, this description is based on 10 specimens that were seen, shot or collected between 1836 and 1876 in India, around Uttarakhand. It has been 142 years since the Himalayan quail was last seen.

In an era of GPS tracking, it might seem unusual that so many species still remain untraceable, but there could be plenty of reasons. According to Asad R Rahmani, former director of Bombay Natural History Society and noted ornithologist, the Himalayan quail for instance was a rarity even during the days when it was seen in Uttarakhand. Same is the case with the pink-headed duck which was uncommon even during the time when its presence around West Bengal, Bihar and Myanmar was fairly known. With lack of scientific studies, greater descriptions of the habitat these species are found in, and probably hunting sprees by locals and colonial empires, these animals and birds have been surviving in virtual oblivion.

Another reason for the continued disappearance could be the absence of a constant field study to track them. In India, for example, the scientific study of the Gooty tarantula and other such giant spiders is relatively recent and began after measures to curb illegal trade of the species were taken in the late 1990s. An international team of experts was brought in during that time to not just search for tarantulas in India, but also train some of the local scientists to continue the work. Efforts like this eventually led to the rediscovery of the peacock spider by Sanjay Molur and his colleagues, inside a tree hole, thousands of metres above the ground, completely protected from human interference but finally spotted by scientists who armed with ladders and dental mirrors had the one-point mission of finding the spider again.

What is worrying is that missions like these to exclusively trace a lost species are few and far between as they need huge funding, time and effort. An area cannot be notified as protected unless there is an evidence of a special species existing in that locality. In the meantime, the habitat is vulnerable to being lost forever as urban needs takeover natural landscapes. For marine animals like the Pondicherry shark that was discovered by chance, the threat also comes when fishermen who unknowingly catch and kill them.

Fishermen who spoke to the scientists in Andhra Pradesh confessed that sharks were sometimes sold in the area but they had no idea about this particular one being so rare. The peacock spider has gained quite a reputation in the exotic pet world adding to the list of threats such lesser known creatures might face. While it is still a rarity in the wild, many pet owners in the US have been known to breed them in captivity and sell them, thanks to an unknown and illegal supply of a few spiders from Sri Lanka to the US in the 90s!

Lost Species Project

Fearing deeper repercussions if a species was never found again, like the loss of an entire ecosystem, Global Wildlife Conservation, an international organisation, started the Lost Species Project a couple of years ago. They listed 1,200 species, including many from India, that had been lost for decades or centuries, and are now collaborating with IUCN to find them. The idea is that if we can rediscover these hidden jewels of nature, then there is still hope to regain what we have lost of wildlife and the environment around us.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"More than just numbers We often frame negative human impacts on animal species in terms of numbers of individuals reduced or numbers of regions from which species are absent. However, human activities are likely affecting species in more complex ways than these figures can capture. Kühl et al. studied behavioral and cultural diversity in our closest relative, the chimpanzee. They found that human-mediated disturbance is reducing these complex traits. Human influence thus goes well beyond simple loss of populations or species, leading to behavioral change even where populations persist. Science, this issue p. 1453

Abstract Chimpanzees possess a large number of behavioral and cultural traits among nonhuman species. The “disturbance hypothesis” predicts that human impact depletes resources and disrupts social learning processes necessary for behavioral and cultural transmission. We used a dataset of 144 chimpanzee communities, with information on 31 behaviors, to show that chimpanzees inhabiting areas with high human impact have a mean probability of occurrence reduced by 88%, across all behaviors, compared to low-impact areas. This behavioral diversity loss was evident irrespective of the grouping or categorization of behaviors. Therefore, human impact may not only be associated with the loss of populations and genetic diversity, but also affects how animals behave. Our results support the view that “culturally significant units” should be integrated into wildlife conservation.

Many animals show population-specific behavioral variation, with chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) exhibiting exceptionally high levels of behavioral diversity (1, 2). This diversity has been documented in a variety of contexts, including communication, thermoregulation, and extractive foraging (table S1). Chimpanzees are also proficient tool users, using sticks, leaves, and stones to access honey, insects, meat, nuts, and algae (table S1). Many of these behaviors are inferred to be socially learned and therefore cultural (2), although the influence of genetic and environmental variation cannot always be ruled out (3). Culture in chimpanzees is supported by the occurrence of local traditions irrespective of resource or tool abundance (1, 2) and by controlled experiments demonstrating that naïve chimpanzees can socially learn new behaviors (4, 5). Moreover, new behaviors, or variants, are regularly discovered when observing previously unstudied populations (5).

Cultural behaviors in great apes, notably chimpanzees (1) and orang-utans (6), are maintained by cultural processes including innovation, diffusion, and vertical and horizontal transmission (2, 7). These behaviors are vulnerable to environmental disturbance, in that if crucial conditions are modified, the overall rate of opportunities for social transmission may be reduced (7). This proposition, named the “disturbance hypothesis,” predicts that under anthropogenically disturbed conditions, behavioral traditions in great apes may disappear not only with the complete extinction of a population, but also when the population remains, owing to resource depletion or a breakdown in opportunities for social learning (7). Major elements of human impact include habitat loss, degradation, and fragmentation, which reduce population size, gregariousness, and long-distance dispersal, weakening behavioral transmission (7).

In the current Anthropocene era, Earth’s biosphere is being heavily degraded by unsustainable resource use and high rates of biodiversity loss (8). This overexploitation is substantially affecting chimpanzees and their habitat, namely African tropical forests and savanna woodlands (9). All four chimpanzee subspecies are severely threatened by deforestation and poaching, caused by a rapidly growing human population (8–10). These factors have already led to major population declines, fragmentation and regional extirpations (10), and reduced genetic diversity (11).

The large behavioral diversity of chimpanzees, coupled with rapid population decline, makes investigation of the disturbance hypothesis timely: To what extent are chimpanzee behavioral and cultural diversity affected by habitat fragmentation and population loss resulting from human activities? To address this question, we applied a range of noninvasive techniques to collect a wide spectrum of environmental, social, demographic, and behavioral information on previously unstudied chimpanzee communities, or communities not fully habituated to human observers, at 46 locations (Fig. 1). The actual number of chimpanzee communities represented is likely to be higher, as individuals from more than one community may have been observed at a location. Therefore, we define a chimpanzee community as those individuals that occur at a specific geographic location, with associated observations on behaviors. With few exceptions, we collected data over a minimum of one annual cycle (observation period between 12 and 30 months at 37 locations; observation period from 1 to 10 months at 9 locations) in a systematic grid design (grid size range: 9 to 143 km2).

Fig. 1 Locations of all 144 unique chimpanzee communities for which information on select behaviors was collected for this study. This dataset includes 46 communities from the Pan African Programme (PanAf) and 106 communities for which information was also available from the published literature (non-PanAf). Of these, eight communities had both PanAf and non-PanAf data available. Habitat type represented as biomes modified from the Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World Map 2001.

We compiled presence and absence data on 31 known chimpanzee behaviors (table S1) from these 46 chimpanzee communities and complemented the dataset with additional information about these same behaviors on another 106 chimpanzee communities from the published literature. In total, 144 unique chimpanzee communities comprised the full dataset (Fig. 1 and data file S1). We recorded observations on these behaviors by (i) extensive camera trapping; (ii) fecal samples that provided evidence of ingestion of insects, algae, and honey, resources often exploited with the aid of tools; and (iii) artifacts of tool use identified during reconnaissance, line, and strip transect surveys. We selected behaviors that were detectable through indirect evidence (e.g., tools and artifacts) or direct evidence from camera traps and that exhibit variation across populations rather than being universal traits of chimpanzees (1, 2, 12) (table S1). Although we do not explicitly test for cultural transmission, we infer that much of chimpanzee behavioral diversity reflects cultural diversity owing to an accumulation of observational and experimental evidence (1, 2, 4, 5, 13). Moreover, many behaviors included here have already been classified as cultural (1).

According to the disturbance hypothesis, potential behavioral diversity loss is expected to manifest across multiple chimpanzee generations, so human impact should be assessed over long time periods. We used the “human footprint,” a spatial composite layer integrating human impact over time by combining infrastructure, human population density, forest cover, and remoteness, to provide a geographically explicit variable quantifying the overall effect of humans on the environment with a 1-km-grid resolution (14). We used both Bayesian regression (BR) and maximum likelihood (ML) mixed models to test the hypothesis that variation in human impact among chimpanzee populations predicts variation in the number of behaviors present (12). We controlled for observation effort in number of months, spatial autocorrelation, and chimpanzee subspecies in the analyses (12) (tables S2 to S6 and figs. S1 to S5).

We found that chimpanzee communities located in areas with a high degree of human impact exhibited an 88% lower mean probability of occurrence, across all behaviors, compared to communities with the least human impact observed {Fig. 2, estimate (mean of the posterior distribution) = −0.40, CI (95% credible interval) = [−0.73, −0.10], P =0.009}. We found this effect irrespective of the grouping of behaviors, i.e., when behaviors were grouped into broader categories such as foraging for termites or thermoregulation (table S1, estimate = −0.30, CI = [−0.80, 0.139], P = 0.006), or when considering non–tool use behaviors only (estimate = −0.75, CI =[−1.77,0.03], P = 0.018), or tool use behaviors only (estimate = −0.37, CI =[−0.73, −0.01], P = 0.018; Fig. 2 and tables S1 to S4). We assessed the reliability of our analyses by testing various subsets of the data and by removing a single behavior at a time, which showed that no single behavior was responsible for our results (figs. S3 and S4 and table S6). The control predictor “subspecies” showed highly overlapping effects, indicating minimal subspecies-specific effects. As expected, the control variable observation months revealed a strong positive effect for all models (figs. S1 and S2 and tables S2 to S5).

Fig. 2 The probability of occurrence of a behavior per chimpanzee community decreases with human impact. Human impact negatively affects the probability of occurrence of behaviors (top left), irrespective of grouping behaviors by category (bottom left), or by tool use and non–tool use behaviors (top and bottom right, respectively). The probability of occurrence across behaviors is depicted by 67, 87, and 97% credibility intervals (green areas) of the mean predicted posterior distribution (dashed line), plotted excluding random effects and for all subspecies combined. The area of the points corresponds to the respective number of chimpanzee communities constituting that data point (range: 1 to 36 communities).

Several potential mechanisms may explain the observed pattern. First, areas with high human impact generally have decreased chimpanzee density and abundance (10). As has been shown for humans (3, 15), population size can play a major role in maintaining cultural traits, although this relationship is debated (16). A similar mechanism may occur in declining chimpanzee populations (17). Second, chimpanzees may reduce the frequency of conspicuous behaviors as human impact increases (7). Third, climate change may play a role. For example, nut production is strongly dependent on weather conditions and a changing climate is causing greater interannual variation in nut availability (18), stochastically increasing the potential loss in nut cracking behavior over time. Fourth, habitat degradation and resource depletion may lead to a lower carrying capacity of individuals, thereby reducing opportunities for social learning. This may eventually lead to the disappearance of the behavior. Most likely, a combination of these mechanisms interacts with environmental stability, demography, and population connectedness, to create the overall loss of chimpanzee behavioral diversity associated with human impact.

Some studies on chimpanzees living in human-dominated landscapes suggest that a reduction in behavioral diversity will eventually be partially compensated for by new inventions (9). Moreover, genetic and ecological variation are expected to continue to be important drivers of behavioral and cultural diversity (3). Chimpanzees do show adaptations to modified environments (9), and one may ask whether the processes of behavioral loss and innovation act on similar, or different, time scales, and at which point they might reach equilibrium (7).

We are currently witnessing a decline in great ape populations at a rate of 2.5 to 6% per year due to human impact (10, 19). Our results suggest that chimpanzee populations are losing their characteristic sets of behavioral traits and that a number of as-yet undiscovered behaviors may be lost without having ever been described. Considerable effort is urgently needed to protect these populations if we are to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and drivers of their cultural diversification. As such, our findings support the concept of “culturally significant units,” whereby a more integrative approach to conservation is needed that considers behavioral diversity in addition to population size and trends for wildlife management (20, 21). Given our limited understanding of the potentially adaptive value of local traditions, we advocate using the precautionary principle of aiming for maximal protection of behavioral variation. We suggest that, for chimpanzees, specific interventions are needed to protect their natural resources and tool-use sites in order to maintain behavioral plasticity and safeguard their capacity for cultural evolution. Therefore, we anticipate the necessity for a new concept, “chimpanzee cultural heritage sites,” with which the behavioral and cultural diversity of this species might be recognized and protected. Such a concept could easily be extended to other species exhibiting a high degree of cultural variability, such as orang-utans (6) and whales (20). This proposition is in accordance with the Convention on Biological Diversity, as well as recent recommendations by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, of the United Nations Environment Programme (22), which calls for the protection of physiological, genetic, and behavioral diversity of culturally rich wildlife.

At first glance Masindi gives the impression of a one-street, nondescript town with relics of colonial architecture. But is has an interesting history: Sally Wareing, a retired octogenarian teacher runs the New Garden View Court Hotel.

“In the 1920s, the East Africa Railways and Harbour transported people and cargo by road between Butiaba (on Lake Albert) to Masindi,” Wareing says as she gives me a tour of the town.

The cargo included ivory and pelts being taken from the Congo to Masindi Port on Lake Kyoga, and then by rail to Mombasa. Masindi town, 45 kilometres from the port, had a customs shed for registration of goods.

With profits running high in 1923, the now defunct East African Railways and Harbours Corporation built the Masindi Hotel where we enjoyed a morning coffee.

In the 1950s, Hollywood stars Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn stayed here during the filming of the African Queen.

In 1954, American author Ernest Hemingway also spent time here after crashing his plane twice at Murchison Falls.

Chimpanzees at Kinyara

It is 6am. An hour’s drive from Masindi has taken us to Kinyara Sugar, one of Uganda’s largest manufacturers to meet its famous residents, a family of chimpanzees living in the riverine forest on both edges of the sugar plantation.

We follow the guide along a path through the indigenous forest that once was part of Budongo forest stretching from Murchison Falls.

Two hours later, the chimpanzee family appears. They are chasing a troop of colobus monkeys. One falls to the ground into the waiting circle of apes and the feast begins.

Our guide informs us that the chimpanzees are allowed to eat the sugarcane courtesy of the sugar millers.

Today there are only 5,0 00 chimpanzees in Uganda, from a population of tens of thousands a century ago. Spread across Africa’s rainforest, the global population is 30,000.

Farther along the route, we see a white-washed church in the middle of green fields. It’s a church built in the late 1940s by Polish refugees after the Second World War.

After the war, thousands of Poles were brought to East Africa by the British and Polish government-in-exile in London.

The church stands strong with the original framed paintings of the Christ’s story, and outside lie the graves of those who died here.

Murchison Falls

Finally, I travel to Murchison Falls. From the gate to the top of the falls the road is tarmacked and cars are speeding on it.

Felled trees lie on the ground along the road to the ferry, where a large bridge is being built over the Nile. Signboards dot the road as Chinese surveyors supervise the construction work.

Kabalega’s aka Murchison’s waterfall thunders down 43 metres through a seven-metre gap in the rocks. The Ugandan government plans to build a dam on Uhuru Falls, which is just a few feet away from Murchison.

Chimpanzees that use a multi-step process and complex tools to gather termites are more likely to share tools with novices, researchers report.

For most wild chimpanzees, tool use is an important part of life—but learning these skills is no simple feat. Wild chimpanzees transfer tools to each other, and this behavior has previously been shown to serve as a form of teaching.

The study helps illuminate chimpanzees’ capacity for prosocial—or helping—behavior, a quality recognized for its potential role in the evolution of human cultural abilities.

“Non-human primates are often thought to learn tool skills by watching others and practicing on their own, with little direct help from mothers or other expert tool users,” says Stephanie Musgrave, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Miami and first author of the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

“In contrast, the results from this research indicate that social learning may vary in relation to how challenging the task is: during tasks that are more difficult, mothers can in fact play a more active role, including behaviors that function to teach.”

Beginning with Jane Goodall in the 1960s, researchers have been studying chimpanzee tool use for decades at the Gombe Stream Research Center in Tanzania. The Gombe chimpanzee study is one of the longest running studies of animal behavior in the wild. This year marks the 20-year anniversary of the study of chimpanzees in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo, where researchers have documented some of the most complex tool behaviors of chimpanzees.

The study is distinctive because it applies standardized methods to directly compare how processes of cultural transmission may differ between two populations of wild chimpanzees. In both populations, the chimpanzees use tools to target the same resource—but the task varies in complexity.

The findings of the current study are important on a number of levels, Musgrave says. “First, chimpanzee populations may vary not only in the complexity of their tool behaviors but in the social mechanisms that support these behaviors,” she says. “Second, the capacity for helping in chimpanzees may be both more robust and more flexible than previously appreciated.”

Chimpanzees as teachers

Among animals, chimpanzees are exceptional tool users. Different groups of chimpanzees use different types of tools—and likewise, researchers have suggested the teaching process might be customized to facilitate these local skills.

In this study, researchers examined the transfer of tools between chimpanzees during termite gathering, and compared the population in the Goualougo Triangle, Republic of Congo, with the population in Gombe, Tanzania.

Termites and other insects are a valuable source of fat and protein in the diet of wild chimpanzees and also contribute important vitamins and minerals. Termites build complex nest structures that encompass a network of below-ground chambers, sometimes topped with a towering, freestanding mound reaching several meters high.

Chimpanzees in both locations use fishing-probe style tools to harvest termites, but Goualougo chimpanzees use multiple, different types of tools sequentially. They also make tools from specific plant species and customize fishing probes to improve their efficiency.

The researchers found differences in the rate, probability, and types of tool transfer during termite gathering between these two populations.

At Goualougo, where the fishing tasks were more complex, the rate of tool transfer was three times higher than at Gombe, and Goualougo mothers were more likely to transfer a tool in response to a request. Further, mothers at Goualougo most often responded to tool requests by actively giving a tool to offspring.

Such active transfers were never observed at Gombe, where mothers most often responded by refusing to transfer tools. Given that offspring in both populations made comparable requests for tools, these differences suggest that mothers at Goualougo were in fact more willing to provide tools.

“We have previously documented that tool transfers at Goualougo function as a form of teaching,” says Crickette Sanz, associate professor of biological anthropology at Washington University in St. Louis. “The population differences we observed in the present study suggest that teaching may be related specifically to the demands of learning to manufacture tools at Goualougo, where chimpanzees use multiple tool types, make tools from select plant species, and perform modifications that increase tool efficiency.”

“An increased role for this type of social learning may thus be an important component of the transmission of complex tool traditions over generations,” she says.

“While Gombe and Goualougo chimpanzees both fish for termites, we suspected that there might be differences in how this skill is acquired,” says Elizabeth Lonsdorf, associate professor of psychology at Franklin & Marshall College. “But only after many years of accumulating these data were we able to rigorously quantify these differences.”

“To date, prosocial helping in chimpanzees has been principally examined in captivity or using differing methods in the wild,” says Stephen Ross, director of the Lester E. Fisher Center for the Study and Conservation of Apes at Lincoln Park Zoo. “This study provides novel evidence for helping behavior in wild chimpanzees and demonstrates that chimpanzees can help flexibly depending on context.”

Passing it on

Understanding how chimpanzees pass on tool traditions over generations can provide insights into the evolutionary origins of complex cultural abilities in humans.

“Human evolution is characterized by the emergence and elaboration of complex technologies, which is often attributed to our species’ aptitude for passing skills onto one another through mechanisms such as teaching and imitation. However, the evolutionary origins of these capacities remain unclear,” Musgrave says.

“Our research shows that the human propensity to assist others in acquiring complex skills may build at least in part upon capacities that we share with our closest living relatives.”

Conservation efforts are fundamental to this research and future studies. “Chimpanzees and their cultures are endangered,” says Emma Stokes, director of the Central Africa Program at the Wildlife Conservation Society.

“Recent research shows that human activity imperils the survival of chimpanzee cultures.

When the art of Congo the chimpanzee was first exhibited in London in the 1950s – at the ICA, among other venues – it immediately won fans. His first collectors included Miró and Picasso, as well as the Duke of Edinburgh. Now a new generation of collectors have the opportunity to acquire a sample of Congo’s unique brand of ‘lyrical abstract expressionism’, as one critic has called it. The zoologist and Surrealist painter Desmond Morris is selling off his collection of paintings and pastels by the chimp, in an exhibition opening this December at the Mayor Gallery.

While researchers have made plentiful attempts to get animals to paint – and there’s even an online gallery selling the endeavours of elephants – few other undomesticated creatures have managed to follow Congo in igniting their artistic spark. Rakewell wonders whether their milieus haven’t been sufficiently creative – unlike that of the pets of artists such as William Wegman, who in a recent interview with the Guardian waxed lyrical about his canine collaborators: his dressed-up Weimaraners. ‘Really serious and so concentrated and funny,’ Wegman said of his first dog, Man Ray.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"On a sunny day in early August 2019, screams broke the calm of a national park in East Africa. Researchers ran to find Kidman – an adult female chimpanzee – and her child being attacked by the dogs of poachers. In their desperate attempt to save them, the researchers fought off the dogs and removed a spear that poachers had lodged in Kidman’s back. She died shortly after the researchers had arrived, her infant a few days later.

Primatologists around the world were in awe of the researchers’ heroic efforts, but we were also shocked that such a vicious attack could happen on the Ngogo apes of Kibale Forest in Uganda – one of the world’s best-known community of chimpanzees in one of Africa’s most famous national parks.

Less than two months later, tragedy struck again. On September 13, less than 1,000km south of Kibale Forest in the Issa Valley of Tanzania, researchers found another two chimpanzees being attacked by dogs. Kitu, a two-year old infant, was mauled by four dogs while her mother, Kila, fought another six. The Issa chimpanzees live outside of national park boundaries and only became accustomed to human presence in 2018.

The researchers beat the dogs back, killing one and badly wounding the others. By the time the last dog limped away, Kila was bleeding badly and couldn’t stand. Kitu called despondently from a few trees away, but Kila didn’t look in her direction as she sat struggling to breathe. Eventually she recovered enough to stand and walk through the forest. Our team decided to stay with Kitu, monitoring the infant chimp, and assumed that Kila would return for her in time. They left her late in the day, with no sign of Kila.

Like humans, infant chimpanzees nurse through the first years of their lives and rely on their mothers for transport and safety to show them what is safe to eat – and who is an ally and who an enemy. While chimpanzees often adopt orphans in their community, we knew Kitu was too young to survive long without Kila.

The next morning, the team found Kitu not far from where they had left her, having travelled in the same direction as her mother the previous day. She was on the ground and seemed to have slept there – something chimpanzees rarely do when they live around predators. They’ve never been observed doing this at Issa. She could only muster groans, too weak to call. She died a few hours after the researchers found her, less than 24 hours since the dog attack.

Chimpanzees led researchers to a feeding tree four days later, under which lay Kila, dead from her injuries.

Scientists on the frontline

Chimpanzees and their cultures are under threat across Africa. Their forest habitats are being converted to farmland while human-transmitted diseases proliferate and decimate populations.

Chimpanzees are also hunted for the bushmeat trade – likely the single most acute threat to their survival in the wild. At Ngogo and Issa, it’s probable that bushmeat hunters were the culprits.

Combined, these threats have pushed chimpanzees onto the IUCN red list of endangered species. In some parts of Africa, chimpanzee populations have declined by 80% since 1990.

Scientists are often forced into being advocates for the species they study – those who study primates often more so than others, simply because we share so much in common with our evolutionary cousins. To protect chimpanzees from the many threats to their survival, we often risk our own safety. Researchers at Issa advise armed patrols and support these teams when in the forest.

Though we couldn’t save Kitu and Kila, the mere presence of researchers here helps protect chimpanzees. Besides collecting data on them, we monitor the forest for other wildlife, including leopards and antelope. We keep an eye on threats such as illegal logging and sponsor Tanzanian postgraduate students – the next generation of chimpanzee researchers.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Western chimpanzees are adapting to survive in severely degraded habitat, a new study says.

However, the study also finds the abundance of western chimpanzees in Sierra Leone is impacted by even secondary roads.

Ensuring the long-term survival of western chimps calls for changes in agriculture, roads and other development, researchers say.

A new study of western chimpanzees in southwestern Sierra Leone finds they are adapting to survive in severely degraded habitat. But researchers say this doesn’t obviate the need to minimize the impacts of development such as roads and promote less-damaging approaches to farming by local people.

Despite the gradual loss of most of their original habitat, the chimpanzees in Moyamba district have survived thanks to a particular set of conditions, according Tatyana Humle, a senior lecturer in conservation and primate behavior at the University of Kent, U.K., and one of the authors of the study.

“In this case, the main driver of forest loss in the locality is slash and burn agriculture which has taken place over generations, and some key natural resources remain in the landscape,” Humle told Mongabay. “The study area is dominated by semi-domesticated oil palm: the oil palm is native to West Africa, and people tend not to cut them down as they are also useful to people for the fruit, palm leaves for construction materials, and local wine production.”

Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a key species for the chimpanzees, which typically build a new nest every night: in the study area, all the nests were built in oil palms in the absence of other mature nesting tree species. Another tree species usually spared by farmers because they eat the fruit is the Guinea plum (Parinari excelsa); the plums are also a preferred food item for chimpanzees.

The relatively small human settlements in the area and local tolerance for the chimps’ presence are also key factors. “[People] do not persecute or kill the chimps out of fear or because they forage on their crops — which chimpanzees do in this study area, probably because wild food resources are limited,” Humle said.

Chimps in the anthropocene

The western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) is today found in eight West African countries, with the greatest numbers found in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The subspecies vanished from parts of its historic range in Benin, Burkina Faso and Togo during the 20th century. Today, it is all but extinct in Ghana, and populations in Côte d’Ivoire have also declined sharply in recent decades.

Sierra Leone is home to perhaps 10 percent of the 53,000 western chimpanzees still in the wild; more than two-thirds of that number live outside of the country’s protected areas.

Western chimps are found in a variety of habitats, including savanna grasslands and dense rainforest. But habitat loss across their range due to expansion of human populations and agriculture, mining and development of infrastructure, is the principal threat to the survival of the subspecies. Combined with diseases such as Ebola and the hunting of the apes for bushmeat and traditional medicine — or in retaliation for the animals’ raids on crops — destruction or degradation of habitat has seen western chimp numbers crash, placing them on the IUCN’s Red List of critically endangered species.

Researchers from the Autonomous University of Barcelona, Spain’s Institute of Game and Wildlife Research, the University of Kent, and Sierra Leone’s Tacugama Chimp Sanctuary set out to investigate how anthropogenic factors (roads, settlements, abandoned settlements and human presence) and available habitat (swamps, farmlands and mangroves) affected the abundance of chimpanzees in Moyamba.

In this part of the country, the original forest has largely been replaced with active and abandoned farmland and stands of semi-wild oil palms; the district is lightly veined with unpaved roads and some relatively undisturbed areas of swamps and mangroves remain. It is a common pattern across West Africa’s forest zones, where a mosaic of farmland, fallow land and remnant forest has become the dominant landscape as human population growth, industrial agriculture and urban expansion encroach on natural habitat.

The team set up 24 infrared camera traps in farmlands, swamps and mangroves across the district during an eight-month period between 2015 and 2016, and captured about 75,000 images.

As expected, the camera trap data showed Moyamba’s chimps preferred to stay close to swamps and tended to avoid roads. But contrary to expectations, chimpanzees’ abundance appeared unaffected by human presence or settlements, be it used or abandoned. The primates were captured on camera in locations close to human settlements, sometimes carrying domesticated fruits like pineapples and mangos. However, the chimps foraged these sources of nutritious food early in the mornings and late in the day, appearing to time their visits to avoid contact with humans who were active in the same areas at midday.

The chimpanzees’ avoidance of the district’s roads stood out for several reasons.

Earlier studies in Central Africa (where a different subspecies of chimpanzee lives) suggested that chimps’ abundance was negatively affected only by the presence of tarmacked main roads, wider than 15 meters (50 feet), and relatively heavy traffic. But the study in Moyamba district found that chimpanzees avoided even the unpaved secondary roads here.

“This has a major implication when it comes to road infrastructure development, which is predicted to increase significantly in the coming years across Africa, including West Africa,” Humle said.

Other researchers in the field express similar concerns.

“This paper highlights that we need to better understand the impact of infrastructural development, such as roads, on chimpanzee distribution and behaviour, especially in light of the future road development across West Africa. It’s unlikely to be good news,” Kimberly Hockings, a conservation scientist at the University of Exeter, who was not involved in the new study, told Mongabay.

Hockings, whose research focuses on interactions between human and nonhuman great apes, said this and other research showing how some chimpanzee populations live in proximity to humans under certain conditions in no way justifies further destruction of ape habitat. “This needs to be made crystal clear,” she said.

The sensitivity of Moyamba’s chimps to even secondary roads has implications for governments in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa, a region seeking to rapidly build much-needed infrastructure. Such infrastructure development can increase loss of habitat, as well as chimpanzee mortality, either directly through road kill or indirectly by enabling poaching, the study said.

Alongside care in planning infrastructure development, the research team would like to see local communities set aside areas in which fruiting trees, such as wild figs, can regenerate. “This could potentially help reduce chimpanzees reliance on crops for food. These areas would also benefit people when it comes to medicinal plants and other useful resources which they acknowledge are longer available due to forest loss,” said Humle.

“If we want to secure their long-term survival, it is crucial that successful protection measures should benefit people and chimpanzees alike,” Humle said. “Conservation actions should focus on education and helping farmers to implement alternative agricultural methods to slash and burn farming and environmentally-friendly revenue generating activities to ensure coexistence between the two species.”

Long-term solutions

Sierra Leone’s government says it is stepping up efforts to protect the chimpanzee. In March, it declared the western chimpanzee the country’s national symbol and promised to open two new sanctuaries for them.

But with the majority of the country’s chimpanzees living outside of protected areas, the creation of new refuges may be missing the point.

Lincoln Larson, an expert on human-wildlife interactions and conflict at North Carolina State University, U.S., argues that with the huge expansion of humankind’s ecological footprint, animals are forced to adapt or perish.

“This might mean occupying, and in some cases even thriving, in land dominated by human infrastructure,” he told Mongabay. “The chimps in Sierra Leone, the leopards in Mumbai, and the mountain lions in Los Angeles are all good examples of this.”

Species may change their behavior, patterns of activity, and even their diets to survive in human-dominated landscapes. But, Larson cautions, the consequences of these changes are unknown. “Confining wildlife to protected areas and/or waiting – hoping – for animals to adapt when they venture outside of parks are not viable ecologically or socio-economically viable options,” Larson says.

“To achieve coexistence, we must be proactive. We must search for creative solutions that support local livelihoods and community develop while simultaneously achieving conservation goals. And we must craft interventions that culturally compatible with the context in which a conflict emerges. All species might be at a crossroads at this point in time, but it is humans who determine where the path forward might lead.”

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Chimpanzees dancing a 'conga' could hold the secret to the evolution of human dance and how people learnt to respond to rhythm, researchers claim.

Psychologists from the University of Warwick studied the movement of a pair of chimpanzees called Holly and Bahkahri at Saint Louis Zoological Park in Missouri, US, that showed them moving in sync.

The team then found other videos online showing similar 'dance-like' behaviour in chimps which is similar to a human conga-line.

The chimps' synchronised body movements, seemingly for no other reason than an expression of emotion, could reveal clues about how - and why - humans started to dance, according to Dr Adriano Lameira from the University of Warwick.

Researchers say the levels of motor co-ordination, synchrony and rhythm between the two matched the levels shown by orchestra players performing the same musical piece.

A pair of chimpanzee females called Holly and Bahkahri have been 'dancing' at St Louis Zoo for a number of years. They walk around the enclosure in perfect sync (pictured)

Researchers found that the chimps were able to move in sync for an extended period of time with each of the pair taking it in turns to 'lead'

The team started their study by watching the movement of two chimpanzees in a video filmed at Saint Louis Zoological Park in Missouri, USA.

In the video you can see two chimps moving in sync one foot at a time while carrying a bag between their legs to the sound of a shaker making a beat.

They walk around the enclosure in perfect harmony with the rear chimp holding on to the first with one arm while the other holds the bag or hangs by its side.

'The newly described behaviour probably represents a new form a stereotypy in captivity in this great ape species', researchers confirmed.

They said the behaviour also forces scientists interested in the evolution of human dance to consider new conditions that may have started 'the emergence of one of human’s most exuberant and richest forms of expression'.

Their enclosure has an outside area of several thousand square foot of space and a range of different climbing structures. They are surrounded by rocky cliffs. The pair (pictured) were born in the same year - 1998

'Dance is an icon of human expression', said Dr Lameira, from the Department of Psychology at the University of Warwick.

'Despite astounding diversity around the world's cultures and dazzling abundance of reminiscent animal systems, the evolution of dance in humans remains obscure.

'Dance requires individuals to interactively synchronise their whole-body tempo to their partner's, with near-perfect precision, this explains why no dance forms were present amongst nonhuman primates.'

He said this new research could help researchers reconstruct the earliest 'proto-stages' of human dance.

'This is evidence for conjoined full-body rhythmic entrainment in great apes that could help reconstruct possible proto-stages of human dance is still lacking.'

The two chimpanzees in the original video that sparked this study into dance and synchronised movement were called Holly and Bahkahri.

They were both born in 1998 at different zoos then transferred to St Louis one day apart in the same year when they were less than four months old.

'The behaviour exhibited by Holly and Bahkahri may have developed at the St Louis Zoo, where the two females have lived throughout virtually all their lives, although the exact timing of the behaviour’s inception is uncertain', says Dr Lameira.

Their enclosure has an outside area of several thousand square foot of space and a range of different climbing structures. They are surrounded by rocky cliffs.

While the zoo used to display chimpanzee entertainment shows until 1982, researchers say this had no bearing on the conga dance.

'The development of the behaviour in Holly and Bahkahri was not, therefore, the result of human training by caretakers or staff as they arrived at the zoo 16 years later after such performances ceased.'

They say dancing chimps provide tentative empirical evidence for evolutionary history of human dance - which may have been rooted in mechanisms of social cohesion among small groups that might have granted stress-releasing benefits. Holly and Bahkahri are pictured here demonstrating their dance

The team were able to find 23 videos showing the same pair of chimpanzees 'dancing' at St Louis between October 2011 and April 2015.

The researchers say that by studying videos they found that synchronisation between individuals was non-random and predictable.

They found that the chimpanzees movement was maintained with instantaneous centi-second precision and jointly regulated.

The individual chimps were also taking turns as 'pace-makers' in the 'dance'.

Researchers say the 'conga-line' chimps found in Missouri is the 'first case of spontaneous whole-body entrainment between two ape peers'.

They say this provides tentative empirical evidence for evolutionary history of human dance - which may have been rooted in mechanisms of social cohesion among small groups that might have granted stress-releasing benefits.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"This story first appeared in the August 1963 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Up on the mountains the midday sun glared fiercely, but down in the valley near the swift-running stream it was cool and still. I stood listening until I heard a faint rustling of leaves—the only sound to betray the presence of the group of chimpanzees I was trying to approach.

Slowly and quietly, but making no attempt to hide, I moved toward the great apes until I was only 30 feet away. As I sat down, they watched me, staring rather hard, and a young female who had been lying on the ground climbed a little way up a tall fig tree.

One of the males stood upright to watch more closely. He was a superb specimen, standing about four and a half feet in height, his massive shoulders and bull neck suggesting the tremendous strength in his arms. He must have weighed a good 130 pounds, and he was strong enough to snap with one hand a branch so tough that a man would be hard put to break it with two.

Later I was to learn how it feels to be slammed on the head from behind by a large male chimpanzee, but fortunately for me he did not continue his attack.

After a moment or two, the group stopped looking my way, recognizing me for the strange hairless primate they had grown accustomed to seeing amid the other mountain fauna. The six adults rested on the ground or stretched out along the branches of a wild fig. Nearby, four youngsters played quietly.

I thought then, as I always think when I am face to face with mature chimpanzees in their native forests, of the striking difference between the wild apes and those in captivity. The chimpanzee imprisoned behind bars is bad tempered in maturity, morose, moody, and frequently rather obscene; in his freedom he is majestic even when excited and, for the most part, dignified and good natured. (Discover how a captive orangutan learned a ""human way of life."")

For about an hour I sat with the group. Then one of the males stood up, scratched thoughtfully, and moved off down the valley. One by one the others followed, the infants riding astride their mothers’ backs like diminutive jockeys. The females and youngsters stared at me as they passed. The males scarcely glanced in my direction.

Africa fulfills a life’s ambition

To be accepted thus by a group of wild chimpanzees is the result of months of patience. In England, before I commenced my field study, I met one or two people who had seen chimpanzees in the wild.

“You’ll never get close to chimps—not unless you’re very well hidden,” they told me.

View Images Gombe Stream Game Reserve spreads across 60 square miles of forested valleys and treeless ridges north of Kigoma, Tanganyika. Chimpanzees on the reserve belong to the subspecies Pan satyrus schweinfurthi. Map by Irvin E. Alleman, National Geographic

At first it seemed they were right, but gradually I was able to move nearer the chimpanzees, until at last I sat among them, enjoying a degree of acceptance that I had hardly dreamed possible.

At this intimate range, I observed details of their lives never recorded before. I saw chimpanzees in the wild hunt and kill for meat. Though this had been suspected, nobody dreamed that a chimpanzee would attack an animal as large as a bushbuck, until I saw an ape with his kill.

Most astonishing of all, I saw chimpanzees fashion and use crude implements—the beginnings of tool use. This discovery could prove helpful to those studying man’s rise to dominance over other primates.

Chimps threatened by civilization

I cannot remember a time when I did not want to go to Africa to study animals. Therefore, after leaving school, I saved up the fare and went to Nairobi, Kenya. There I was fortunate in meeting and working for Dr. Louis S. B. Leaky, then curator of the Coryndon Museum. After a year, Dr. Leakey asked me if I would undertake a field study of chimpanzees.

Although the chimpanzee has been known to science for nearly three centuries, and although, because of its striking resemblance to man, it has been used extensively as an experimental animal in medical and other fields, no attempts had been made to study this ape in its natural habitat until Dr. Henry W. Nissen made his pioneer study in French Guinea. I found his 1931 report invaluable as I prepared my own program.

The primary aim of my field study was to discover as much as possible about the way of life of the chimpanzee before it is too late—before encroachments of civilization crowd out, forever, all nonhuman competitors. Second, there is the hope that results of this research may help man in his search toward understanding himself. Laboratory tests have revealed a surprising amount of “insight” in the chimpanzee—the rudiments of reasoned thinking. Knowledge of social traditions and culture of such an animal, studied under natural conditions, could throw new light on the growth and spread of early human cultures.

Nineteen months after Dr. Leakey suggested the field study, I had received funds for a preliminary investigation from the Wilkie Foundation, Des Plaines, Illinois, which supports studies of man and other primates. I was ready to set out for a three-month visit to Lake Tanganyika region. The authorities were unwilling to allow a single European girl to go off into the bush by herself, and so my mother accompanied me. (Read how Jane Goodall overcame gender barriers in her field.)

Bumps and dust for 840 miles

From Nairobi it took us more than five days to reach the Gombe Stream Game Reserve in Tanganyika, a 60-square-mile protected area set aside by the British where I would do my research. The Land-Rover was heavily overloaded, and most of the 840 miles of earth roads were in terrible condition.

Eventually, after innumerable delays, we reached Kigoma, a small European settlement overlooking Lake Tanganyika. There I hired the government launch to take us on the last stage of the journey—the 16 miles up the lake to the Gombe chimpanzee reserve.

Game Ranger David Anstey had arranged one of his semi-annual visits to the reserve to coincide with our arrival. As we traveled up the crystal-clear lake, I studied the terrain where I was to work. The mountains rise steeply from the narrow beach and are broken by innumerable valleys and gorges. The valleys are thickly forested, but the upper slopes become open woodland and many of the peaks and ridges are treeless. Most of the wild chimpanzees in Africa inhabit the dense rain forests of the Congo and west coast. The more open country of the Gombe Stream reserve is ideal for field study, though behavior of apes living there might not be the same as that of apes in the dense forests.

Our talk as we sailed the lake was about chimpanzees, and one of Ranger Anstey’s stories persuaded me that they can be dangerous when cornered.

He told me of an African who decided to climb an oil-palm tree to cut down some nuts for cooking oil. A chimpanzee was high in the tree, feeding on the nuts, but the African failed to notice the animal until he had climbed well up the trunk. The ape, intent on feeding, only then saw the African, started rapidly down, and as he passed the man, hit out at him, slashing away half his cheek and one eye as he did so.

At about 2 o’clock on the afternoon of July 14, 1960, we arrived at Kasekela, a campsite midway along the 10-mile coastline of the reserve. The motor launch went back to Kigoma, with orders to return for David a few days later. We found ourselves on the beach, surrounded by untidy-looking crates and bundles, together with the small boat and its outboard motor which would be our only link with civilization. Our permanent party numbered four: myself; my mother; Dominic, our African cook; and Dominic’s wife. (Watch Jane Goodall reflect on her legacy and imagine what lies ahead.)

Despair marks first field studies

As we set up camp that first day, we found the heat almost intolerable, but the big tent was soon pitched and everything bundled inside. I shall always remember David’s expression when he found that our only tableware consisted of a couple tin plates, a cup without a handle, and a thermos top! Indeed we were equipped with only the barest essentials, and I think even Dominic was secretly shocked.

During the first two months of my field studies, I often despaired. Each dawn I set out alone, following the little streams as I explored the valleys one by one, forcing my way through the dense undergrowth or scrambling up the steep slopes. Sometimes I saw a group of chimpanzees feeding in a tree, but seldom managed to get close before the shy apes moved away. Frequently I heard their noisy calling, but usually they had moved off before I could catch up with them. Disheartened, I trudged wearily back to camp each dusk.

But those early days, however frustrating, initiated me into the ways of mountain life. The forests no longer seemed hostile after I learned to creep along pig trails instead of forcing my way through the undergrowth. The slopes were no longer a nightmare when I had discovered the baboon trails where I could pull myself up the steepest parts by roots worn smooth by constant use. I became acquainted with other animals: troops of vervet and redtail monkeys; the beautiful red colobus monkey; the shy bushbuck; the fat ginger bush pig.

One morning, while walking along the lake shore, I was approached by an excited fisherman who showed me a tree into which a bull buffalo had chased him the night before. “Huyu kali sana,” the man said. “He’s a bad one, this fellow.”

Indeed, the tree was scored by innumerable gashes from the buffalo’s horns. Mostly, however, the small herds are wary and hard to approach.

Once I did have to climb a tree, when I met two crotchety old bulls along a narrow track. My climb to safety was speeded by memory of Dr. Leakey’s opinion of them.

“I’d rather meet a rhinoceros or a lion any day. I am more frightened of the buffalo than of any other creature in Africa.”

Often I saw tracks of leopard, or recognized its powerful feline smell, and sometimes I heard the soft rasping of its hunting call. Many months later I saw one. He passed only a few yards away in the long grass, and I felt slightly apprehensive. But when he winded me he turned silently away.

One-girl camp set up near chimps

I never attempted to hide, and gradually the animals became used to the strange pale-skinned primate that had invaded their territory. After about six months, most of the chimpanzees would sit and look at me calmly at distances of 100 yards. At first they fled if they saw me within 500 yards.

Three-quarters of an hour’s climb from camp, I discovered a peak overlooking two valleys and many open grassy ridges and slopes—an ideal place for long-distance observation. From the peak I could locate a group and then try to get closer. I had a tin trunk carried up there, with blanket, electric torch, a couple of tins of baked beans, coffee, and a kettle. When the chimps slept close by, I stayed up in the mountains near them.

So, gradually, I began to learn the basic behavior patterns of the chimpanzees, and after six months I was able to pick out and name some individuals. When I saw Mike lazing in the sun, for example, or Count Dracula ambling past, it was like meeting a friend.

People often ask me how I choose such names for individual chimpanzees. My answer is that some names—such as Mrs. Maggs, Spray, and Mr. McGregor—simply come to mind. Strange as it may sound, some chimpanzees remind me of friends or acquaintances in some gesture or manner and are named accordingly. (See the Gombe chimpanzee family album.)

One chimpanzee had a pale, flesh-colored face instead of the dark color common in adults. It gave me a slightly eerie feeling when I first saw him close to, and ever after that he was “Count Dracula.”

Study extended by society grant

When the three preliminary months came to an end, the National Geographic Society took over sponsorship of my research and financed a further 20 months. My mother had to return to England, but by then I was accepted by the authorities and so was allowed to stay on at the reserve. (Hear our editor's first impressions of Jane Goodall.)

At this time I was joined by Hassan, of the Kakamega tribe, an African who had worked for Dr. Leakey for 15 years—a most responsible and reliable helper. He took over the little boat and the monthly trip to Kigoma for stores and mail. The trial period was over, and I could settle down to building a closer contact with the apes.

Chimpanzees are nomadic within their territory, and they follow no fixed circuit. They have no regular sleeping trees. Most chimpanzees in the reserve—probably between 60 and 80 individuals—range, at various times of the year, over the whole 60 square miles, and sometimes beyond the boundaries. The distance and direction of their wanderings—they may travel as much as eight or ten miles in a day—depend on the seasonal availability of the fruits, leaves, and blossoms that form the bulk of their diet.

The chimpanzees during much of the year move about in small groups of three to six animals. Such a group, I discovered from observation, may consist of adult males and females, of females and juveniles, of males only, or a mixture of sexes and ages.

During the day two or three small groups may join and move about together for a few hours or a few days. In certain seasons, mainly when some kind of favorite fruit is plentiful, I have often seen as many as 25 chimpanzees together.

What makes the social pattern so complicated is that the small groups are not stable. When two groups which have joined temporarily separate again, there has frequently been an exchange of individuals. Males often leave the group they are with to move about alone, subsequently joining another group or another lone male.

This casual, free-and-easy grouping makes it harder to recognize individuals, yet it is essential to do so before one can even begin to understand the social pattern.

From my mountaintop perch, I observed how chimpanzees go to bed. Every night each one makes its own sleeping platform, or nest—except for the small infants, which sleep with their mothers until they are about three years old. (See how scientists are still using Jane Goodall's original research.)

Treetops provide springy mattresses

The construction of a nest, I found, is simple and takes only a couple of minutes. After choosing a suitable foundation, such as a horizontal fork with several branches growing out, the chimpanzee stands on this and bends down a number of branches from each side so that the leafy ends rest across the foundation. He holds them in place with his feet.

Finally he bends in all the little leafy twigs that project around the nest, and the bed is ready. But the chimpanzee likes his comfort, and often, after lying down for a moment, he sits up and reaches out for a handful of leafy twigs which he pops under his head or some other part of his body. Then he settles down again with obvious satisfaction.

One evening I sat quietly below a group of five chimpanzees that were feeding in a tree. There was Mrs. Maggs with her two offspring: little Jo, about two years old; and Spray, then about five. There was another mature female, Matilda, and a young male, Hugh.

Just before sunset there was excited calling as another male joined the group. Spray climbed down from the tree and ran up the slope to greet him. As they climbed the tree together, I saw that the newcomer was Mr. McGregor, an old male who had lost the hair from his sholders and was almost completely bald-headed—a rarity in chimpanzees.

The group fed quietly until the sun had almost vanished behind the mountains across the lake, and then Mrs. Maggs began looking for a place to make her nest. She tested the branches exactly the way a person tests the springs of a hotel bed. One by one, the other apes began to make their nests.

When the sun finally sank out of sight, Mrs. Maggs was lying on her back in her completed nest. As the chill of night crept into the air, little Jo ran to her mother, who put out her arm and drew the young one close to the warmth of her body.

Darkness fell swiftly and I climbed to my mountaintop lookout post, opened a tin of beans, and boiled my kettle over a little fire. The moon was nearly full, and the mountains were beautiful and rather ghostly when I returned to the chimpanzees. I disturbed them as I settled down with my blanket about 50 yards away, and they began to call out loudly, alerting a troop of baboons sleeping in the valley below. The chimpanzees soon quieted down, but the baboons went on barking for a long time.

The chimpanzees slept soundly for the rest of the night, but I was perched halfway down a steep slope with only a small tree to keep me from slithering into the ravine below. I was glad for the first glimmering of dawn.

As it grew lighter I gradually made out the dark shape of Mrs. Maggs, with Jo curled up beside her. Soon Jo sat up, yawned, and gazed about. Mrs. Maggs rolled over onto her back, flung out an arm, and also yawned. Jo jumped onto her chest, leaned forward, and pressed her face against her mother’s, flinging her arms around her neck.

Chimps awake in mood for fun

The other apes began to move. I could see Matilda sitting up in her nest and Spray feeding in a tree close by.

Jo became restless. She climbed to a branch above the nest and hung down, kicking and twisting from side to side. Her mother reached up and patted her, pushing her to and fro, until Jo, delighted, tumbled down on top of her. Mrs. Maggs, her legs in the air, bounced Jo up and down with her feet and then suddenly bent her knees so that Jo collapsed in a heap of waving arms and legs.

The game went on for about ten minutes; then Mrs. Maggs suddenly sat up and peered through the branches. Matilda had left her nest, and sounds below indicated that the others were moving away. Mrs. Maggs touched Jo, who jumped to her at once, clinging under her belly as the mother swung down from the tree.

When a chimpanzee is born, it is almost as helpless as a human baby, save that it rapidly develops great strength in hands and feed, enabling it to cling to its mother’s long hair as she travels from place to place.

For the first four months the infant never leaves its mother, but after this it begins to venture first a few feet and then a few yards away. It is still very unsure of itself, and the mother is always ready to reach out should it lose its balance.

Babies play like human children

By the time the infant is about a year old, it has more confidence and spends hours playing gently, hanging from a branch and patting at its toes, or doing careful gymnastics on a branch. If two infants play together, they pat out at each other or have a tug-of-war with a twig. Always the games are slow and gentle.

By the time they are about two years old, the little apes are very active and their playing far more adventurous. Whether they are swinging and leaping around in a tree or rolling over and over on the ground, they never seem to be still for a minute.

Their elders, particularly the adolescents and the younger males, are amazingly good-natured with them. I once watched little Fifi tormenting an adolescent male, Figan. He was resting peacefully when Fifi hurled herself onto him, pulling his hair, pushing her fingers into his face, biting his ears. She swung above him, kicking out, while he indulgently pushed her to and fro with one hand. Finally, exhausted for the moment, she flung herself down beside him.

From the ages of about three years the young chimpanzee becomes more and more independent. Often it still moves around with its mother until it is five or six, but it no longer rides on her back or sleeps in the nest with her at night. Games become rougher and wilder, wrestling and chasing being the favorite sports.

Occasionally a small infant tries to join in, and then the older ones treat it with great consideration. I saw one youngster swinging an infant gently by one arm and then, after peering down, she dropped the little one to a leafy platform a few feet below. When the infant had difficulty in climbing up again, she gave a helping hand.

At about eight years, the chimpanzee child attains puberty, and during the next three or four years of adolescence it gradually takes its place in society. How long it might live, no one can say pending further study, but a good guess for average life span in the wild would be 40 to 50 years.

Chimps express feelings in action

In this society, relationships among the adult apes are more harmonious than had been assumed from observations of chimpanzees in captivity. Of course, if you judged from sound alone, you would imagine that wild chimpanzees were always fighting and quarreling. When two groups meet there is sometimes a fantastic cacophony as the males call loudly, drum on tree trunks, and shake branches, while the females and youngsters scream and rush out of the way. But this is merely excitement and pleasure; with his highly emotional extrovert temperament, the chimpanzee likes to express his feelings in action.

When squabbles do arise, often over the merest triviality, they are usually settled by gestures and loud protest. Once I was watching a youngster feeding peacefully beside an adult male. By chance, they both reached for the same fruit. The youngster immediately withdrew its hand, but screamed loudly and “flapped out” at the male. The male screamed and flapped at the youngster. This went on for a few moments and then the quarrel ended, neither ape having touched the other.

Relationships between mature and adolescent males are particularly harmonious—they do not even fight over females! I once saw seven males in succession mate with a single female, with no sign of jealousy or antagonism.

As to mating in general, chimpanzees in captivity breed all year round, and it seems likely that this is the case in the wild, because females appear receptive toward males during all months of the year. In addition, I saw small infants in April, June, September, and October.

During September and October, however, when the chimpanzees are frequently seen moving about in large aggregations, excitement, caused by this social stimulation, does appear to have a very marked effect upon reproductive behavior. I saw the animals mating almost daily during these two months—spring in Tanganyika. Thus, although it would appear that a certain amount of mating must take place throughout the year, there is, apparently, a very definite mating season.

Mutual grooming plays an important role in the social life of chimpanzees, and two friends, or even a small group, will sit quietly for hours searching through each other’s long black hair for specks of dirt, grass seeds, or ticks.

Some students of animal behavior see in this grooming activity the first beginnings of true social and altruistic behavior in the whole animal kingdom.

Calls and gestures serve as language

I am often asked, “Do chimpanzees have a language?” They do not, of course, have a language that can be compared with our own, but they do have a tremendous variety of calls, each one induced by a different emotion.

The calls range from the rather low-pitched “hoo” of greeting, and the series of low grunts that is heard when a chimpanzee begins to feed on some desirable food, to the loud, excited calls and screams which occur when two groups meet.

View Images Balancing in a tree, apes groom each other. Remarkably free of fleas, these chimps pick out seeds, dirt, burrs, and ticks. Among adults, mutual grooming takes as much as two hours of leisure time daily. Photograph by Jane Goodall, National Geographic

One call, given in defiance of a possible predator, or when a chimpanzee, for some reason, is angry at the approach of another, can be described as a loud “wraaaah.” This is a single syllable, several times repeated, and is one of the most savage and spine-chilling sounds of the African forest.

Another characteristic call is a series of hoots, the breath drawn in audibly after each hoot, and ending with three or four roars. This is the cry of a male chimpanzee as he crosses a ridge. It seems to be an announcement to any other chimpanzees that may be in the valley below: “Here I come.”

These calls, while they are not a language in our sense of the word, are understood by other chimpanzees and certainly form a means of communication.

In addition, chimpanzees communicate by touch or gesture. A mother touches her young one when she is about to move away, or taps on the trunk when she wants it to come down from a tree. When a chimpanzee is anxious for a share of some delicacy, he begs, holding out his hand palm up, exactly as we do. He may pat the branch beside him if he wants a companion to join him there. When two animals are grooming each other and one feels that it is his turn to be groomed, he often reaches out and gives his companion a poke.

Once, when three males were all grooming one another, I saw a female going round poking at each of them in turn. But she was completely ignored—and so sat down sadly and groomed herself!

There are also many gestures of greeting and friendship. Sometimes when two friends meet after a separation, they fling their arms around each other in a delighted embrace.

Despite this fairly well-developed system of communication, a chimpanzee suddenly confronted with danger gives no alarm call to warn his companions, but simply runs off silently.

Defiant glares greet visitor

This was the way the apes initially reacted to my presence, but after a few months fear replaced curiousity. Curiosity, in turn, changed to defiance. Then, instead of running away or peering suspiciously at me, some of the chimpanzees would climb into the trees and rock the branches, glaring at me in silence.

Those silent “displays,” as modern scientific zoologists call them, were still tinged by fear, and it was many months before the chimpanzees were sufficiently unafraid to react with real aggression. It happened for the first time when I was following a group in thick forest. The chimpanzees had stopped calling when they heard my approach, and I paused to listen, unsure of their whereabouts.

A branch snapped in the undergrowth right beside me, and then I saw a juvenile sitting siliently in a tree almost overhead, with two females nearby. I was right in among the apes. I sat down. Then I heard a low “huh” from a tangle of lianas to my right, but I could see nothing. Then came another “huh” behind me, and another in front.

Curiosity prompts an attack

For about 10 minutes these uneasy calls continued. Occasionally I made out a dark shape in the undergrowth, or saw a black hand clutching a liana, or a pair of eyes glaring from beneath black, beetling brows.

The calls grew louder, and all at once a tremendous bedlam broke out—loud, savage yells that raised the hair on the back of my neck. I saw six large males, and they became more and more excited, shaking branches and snapping off twigs. One climbed a small sapling right beside me and, all his hair standing on end, swayed the tree backward and forward until it seemed he must land on top of me. Then, quite suddenly, the display was over and the males began to feed quietly beside the females and youngsters.

On one occasion I was actually hit by a chimpanzee in the wild, but this was prompted by curiosity rather than aggression.

I was waiting near a ripe fruit tree when I heard footsteps in the leaves behind me. Not wanting to startle the apes, I lay down, hoping that they would reach the fruit tree without seeing me. But the footsteps stopped, and I heard small, high-pitched sounds behind me: “Hoo! Hoo!” The inflection told me the chimpanzees were surprised or uneasy.

I did not move, and suddenly a mature male climbed into the tree above me and sat, scarcely 10 feet over my head, peering down at the strange object below. I think he was puzzled by my immobility and by the sheet of polyethylene protecting me from the rain.

He worked himself into a rage, hitting the trunk and shaking the branches. His small hoots became louder until, with mouth wide open to show yellow canines, he was uttering high-pitched, choking screams of anger.

Still I did not move. Through the corner of my eye I could see three others watching.

All at once the male disappeared, and I heard him moving in the leaves behind me. There was silence and then, with a loud scream, he rushed forward and I felt the slam of his hand on the back of my head.

The experiment had gone far enough—the fate of the African who had lost and eye and half his cheek in an encounter with an angry chimpanzee came to mind. Slowly I sat up, and at last the ape realized exactly what I was. He moved away with his companions, still brave from his passion, calling out and drumming on the trees.

Later I talked with Dr. Leakey about the incident—and was thankful I had made no sudden moves or cries that would have further enraged the chimpanzee.

“If you had waved your arms, shouted, or shown anger in any way,” he said, “you might have been killed. He was merely testing to find out if you were an enemy or not.”

Gradually, during the months of my study, the apes became less aggressive, until finally I was greeted almost as another chimpanzee—sometimes by a show of excitement with hooting and shaking of branches, and sometimes by a complete lack of interest.

On the whole the chimpanzees merely tolerated me, but one, a mature male in the prime of life, went a stage further, and tolerance became friendship. David Greybeard—he deserves an article to himself.

It was during the eighth month of my research, when the fruit was ripe on one of the oil palms outside my tent, that David paid his first visit to camp. Dominic told me about it when I got down from the mountains that April evening.

The following day I learned he had called again, and so I determined to wait in camp to try to see him. I recognized him at once from having seen him in the forest; he had always been particularly unafraid of me there.

He visited camp almost every day for about a week, and then the nuts were finished and he stopped coming.

David provides a wonderful moment

When more palm nuts ripened, however, David again visited us. Even in those early days he sat feeding calmly while I walked about under the trees. I discovered that he liked bananas too and left a few out for him.

Gradually he became tamer and tamer, but it was not until the last five months that David showed complete confidence in his human friend. Two of the palms in camp were ripe, so I got in a great supply of bananas and devoted myself to David for a whole week.

After three days he actually took a banana from my hand. It was a wonderful moment. He was apprehensive when I held it out. He stood up and hit the trunk of a tree, rocking slightly from foot to foot. But when he took the fruit there was no snatching—he was amazingly gentle from the first.

Friends in the forest, too

After that I began carrying a couple of bananas with me up in the mountains, and when I met David he would come up and take them, sitting close beside me, to the astonishment of his companions who gazed wide-eyed at the behavior of their fellow ape! Even when I had no bananas David would come to sit beside me for a moment, with a soft “hoo!” of greeting.

Soon David began popping into camp any old day, whether there was palm with fruit or not. Dominic and Hassan were both delighted and would describe David’s visits in detail when I returned from the mountains in the evenings. (Follow our photographer's journey with Goodall throughout Africa.)

Best of all, David began to bring two friends along, Goliath and William. At first they were shy and watched from the safety of the trees, but eventually the sight of David sitting and stuffing himself was too much for them, and they rushed out to grab a share of bananas. Ultimately they became as tame as David, and I was able to treat the three in a way few people would care to treat a mature chimpanzee in captivity.

Clothing and blankets disappear

In addition to their love for bananas, David and his friends had a passion for sucking material—old clothes and greasy cloths from the kitchen were the most sought after. David went off with a good many blankets, as well as shirts and other garments, and Goliath took many tea towels, but it was William who was the real thief.

William looked for things to steal, and Dominic, as soon as he saw him approach, would rush off to protect the washing and watch over the tents.

But there were many days when William’s arrival went unnoticed, and finally my wardrobe was reduced to one pair of shorts and two shirts. All my blankets had, at some time or another, been rescued from the trees where William had abandoned them.

Chimpanzees show as much individuality as man himself, and David, Goliath, and William have very different characters. David has an exceptionally calm disposition and an air of natural dignity. He takes life as it comes, moving leisurely from place to place, and is always trying to calm the excitable Goliath.

Goliath, with his massive shoulders and bull neck, could easily be taken for a gorilla at first glance. He is wild, impetuous, and inclined to violence; all his movements are vigorous, whether his is swinging down from a tree or charging off to meet a friend.

His large size and uncertain temper make him well respected by other chimpanzees. When he leaps into a tree to join a group, there are wild screams as the hitherto peaceful chimpanzees scatter in all directions. He is the only male I have seen actually attacking a female, and on one occasion he even drove a young ape from its nest, which he then appropriated, bending in a few more branches and settling down with great satisfaction.

Angry goliath brandishes ax

When I refused to give Goliath more bananas, he became tremendously excited and rushed about slapping the ground or tearing off branches and waving them in the air. Once when I withheld the fruit, he charged after Dominic’s wife, seizing an ax that was lying nearby and brandishing it over his head. He probably had no intention of using it as a weapon. It was simply a means of expressing his frustration; he calmed down at once when I went up to him with a banana.

William—well, William is just William. With his long, scarred upper lip and his long, drooping lower lip he is the clown of Chimpland. Yet he is a rather pathetic individual under his clownishness. In the early days when he sat watching David eat bananas and dared not approach, he would rock himself quietly from side to side, occasionally saying sadly, “Hoo! Hoo!” Once or twice he was a little more active, rocking branches and snapping twigs, but he never gave a display like Goliath’s.

Even in health William is a sad figure, with his bony hips, his broken finger, his curled-up, slightly deformed feet, and his scars. Such scars and deformities are rare to my knowledge, though I have seen other broken fingers.

Once when William had a dreadful cold, he slept in the same nest for three nights, a most unusual procedure. Each night it poured rain, and when he climbed down in the morning he was shivering violently, and coughing and wheezing so that I longed to give him a hot toddy instead of a cold banana.

Chimpanzees often call out if it rains during the night. They sit up in their nests, hunched forward over their knees with heads bent down, and wait until the rain stops. I never observed them attempting to make a shelter or take advantage of any natural one. (Hear Jane Goodall's concerns about the future of the Serengeti.)

Rains make grass 12 feet tall

Rainfall in the Kigoma area is heavy, and the rainy season, which starts with the “short rains” in October, carries on without a break into the “long rains,” which last until May.

At the start of the short rains, the mountains are at their most beautiful, with green grass pushing up through the black volcanic soil, and flowers, many of them exquisitely lovely, appearing overnight.

Gradually, however, it becomes hard to move through the mountains. The grass, razor sharp and always drenched by rain or dew, shoots up to 12 feet or more all over the reserve, and traveling along the overgrown tracks is no joke. Once I came within 10 yards of a bull buffalo who was lying down dozing. Luckily I was downwind and he never knew I was there.

Keeping equipment dry is a never-ending battle. Water condenses in binoculars, camera lenses mist over, and everything is permanently thick with mildew.

In addition, when I am moving about through grass taller than my head, it is difficult to see anything. In order to continue my observations, I have to climb trees. Thus, as the rainy season progresses, my own habits become increasingly arboreal!

December brings the departure of the last of the fishermen permitted in the reserve, and my evening clinics, which consist mainly of handing out aspirin, Epsom salts, antimalaria pills, or adhesive tape to the inevitable visitors to camp, are considerably reduced. These clinics, started by my mother when we first arrived at the reserve, were a tremendous help in establishing and maintaining friendly relations with the Africans.

My most faithful patient was eight-year-old Jamanne. He always managed to think up some complaint, and was happiest when he could produce a minute scratch and demand a strip of adhesive tape. But his chief delight lay in helping me, handing out the medicine and explaining to the fishermen in the most superior manner how they should take it.

During the rains the chimpanzees tend to go to bed earlier and get up later, and when they rest during the day they often make themselves a day nest in a tree rather than lie on the cold, damp ground.

At these times infants still sleeping with their mothers at night make little nests as a sort of game, and very instructive play it is. An infant of eighteen months finds it difficult to bend in even a couple of twigs; each time it reaches out for a second one, the first springs up again. But by the time the young one is ready to sleep alone, it has mastered the nest-making technique.

Rain incited a violent ritual

Generally speaking, chimpanzees become more active during the rains and often, for no apparent reason, a male will break into a run, slapping the ground or hitting out at a low branch as he passes. This behavior, when large groups are present, may develop into a fascinating display which I have called the “rain dance.”

View Images Leaping from trees and brandishing boughs, apes charge downhill in a wild rain dance. Illustration by Walter A. Weber, National Geographic

I saw it on four occasions, always about midday and always in similar terrain. In every instance it followed the same pattern, but the duration varied from 15 to 30 minutes. It did not always take place in the rain, but rain was falling hard the first time I saw it.

I was watching a large group of chimpanzees, 16 in all, feeding and playing in a tree halfway up the opposite slope of a narrow ravine. Rain had been threatening all morning and finally it came down, gently at first, becoming gradually heavier.

When the rain started, the chimpanzees climbed down from the tree one by one and sat for a while on the ground before starting off up the grassy slope.

They had divided into two groups, with four large males in one group and three in the other. As they neared the ridge at the top, one of the males suddenly turned and charged diagonally downward, slapping the ground, calling loudly, and hitting at a tree as he passed. At once a male from the other group turned and began to run down the slope. Standing upright, he tore a low branch from a tree, waved it for a moment, and then dragged it behind him as he ran.

Meanwhile the females and juveniles were climbing trees near the skyline to watch.

At the top of the slope another male stood upright, rocking slightly from foot to foot, his arms swinging, working up momentum. Then he took away, charging downward, breaking off a great bough as he went. Two more set off, calling wildly. One after the other they sprang up into a tree and, without a pause, hurled themselves some 25 feet to the ground, tearing off branches as they fell and dragging them on their downward run.

At the bottom, each chimpanzee swung up into a tree to break his headlong rush. There he sat for a moment before climbing down to plod up to the top of the slope once more. Then, with loud cries, he was off again.

Thunder roars above apes’ wild calls

All the time the rain pelted down, harder and harder, while lightning streaked across the leaden sky and crashing thunder almost drowned the wild calling of the apes. Against the new green grass they looked very black and huge—primitive, hairy men displaying their strength.

For about half an hour I watched; and then, as suddenly as it had started, the display was over. The spectators climbed down from their trees, and one by one the chimpanzees wandered up to the ridge and disappeared over the top. The last male paused on the skyline, looking back toward me with one hand on a tree trunk—the actor taking his final curtain. Then he, too, was gone.

Rain seems to have more effect on some chimpanzees than others. Goliath in particular often gets very excited at the start of a rainstorm, and once he did a fantastic dance all by himself, swaying rhythmically from foot to foot, tearing down huge branches, and gradually becoming wilder and wilder. William, who was sitting close beside him at the start, paid absolutely no attention.

David Greybeard is inclined to become truculent in the rain. Once during a thunderstorm, when I was sitting on the banana box trying to prevent his taking all the fruit, he came up and stood upright in front of me, hooting loudly, with one arm raised above his head. He then danced about, hitting a tree, the box, and finally me.

Chimps and baboons sometimes clash

Occasionally a group of baboons gathers round David while he is eating bananas. Sometimes he ignores them, but often, and particularly when it is raining, he chases them off, swinging his arms and hooting.

The relationship between the chimpanzee and the baboon is complex and interesting. The ape is the larger and more powerful animal, but the baboon is far more numerous and represents the chimpanzee’s only serious competitor for food.

For the most part the two species tolerate each other, and it is common to see baboon and chimpanzee feeding in the same tree. On the other hand, I have seen a group of chimpanzees leap out of a tree at the approach of a baboon troop. On one occasion a fairly young male baboon climbed up into a palm where David and William were feeding and began to taunt William, going up to him, barking and hitting out at him. William hit back and the two fought for a moment. Then both chimpanzees climbed from the tree, leaving the baboon in possession.

Sometimes young male baboons chase after female and juvenile chimpanzees, which rush away screaming. Often one or two male chimpanzees then join in, chasing after the baboons, which flee in turn. These mock battles seem to be a strange mixture of play and aggression. (See vintage photos of Jane's time in Gombe.)

I once watched a troop of baboons teasing four adult chimpanzees—two males and two females. The male baboons insolently moved closer and closer to the apes—until, all at once, the latter seemed to lose their tempers.

The males stood upright and charged at their tormentors, swinging their arms over their heads. The females leaped to the low branches of a tree and, leaning down, screamed piercingly at the baboons below. I thought a real fight would take place, but after a few moments the male chimpanzees returned from the chase, and both apes and baboons walked peacefully on.

It would seem that the chimpanzee and the baboon tolerate each other because each, to some extent, has respect for the other. But these happy relations do not exist between the chimpanzee and some of this smaller neighbors.

Gombe chimpanzees eat meat

It will be a surprise to many to learn that the chimpanzee in the wild has definite carnivorous tendencies. It has always been suspected by scientists that wild chimpanzees might eat an occasional lizard or small rodent, but no one thought these apes might kill fairly large animals.

As far as I can determine, the fact that they do so came to light for the first time during my research. This behavior may not be common to all races of chimpanzees in Africa, but it is certainly true of those of the Gombe Stream Reserve.

Monkeys seem to be a favorite item on the menu. I saw them eaten on four occasions, and twice I found bits of bone in the chimpanzee droppings. In addition, I once saw a young bushbuck eaten, and another time a young bush pig. Four times the prey was unidentifiable.

I saw chimpanzees eating meat several times before I actually saw them attack and kill. On that occasion the prey was a red colobus monkey. I was watching four of these monkeys resting in a tall, leafless tree when suddenly a young chimpanzee climbed into a neighboring tree. He sat close enough to one of the monkeys to attract its attention, yet not close enough to scare it away. Meanwhile another young chimpanzee bounded up the tree in which the monkey was sitting, ran with incredible speed along the branch, leaped at the colobus, caught it with its hands, and presumably broke its neck.

Five other chimpanzees then climbed up, including a mature male. But because an adolescent had made the kill, the carcass was torn up and shared among the whole group, with no fighting or quarreling.

At other times, however, when the prey is in the possession of a mature male, there is no such sharing. The others in the group show respect. They sit as close to the male as they can, watching the meat with longing eyes, holding out their hands palm uppermost in a begging gesture.

William pays price for grabbing

The reaction of the male to his suppliants varies. Let me describe the time when Huxley was eating a young bushbuck. He was clasping the carcass with one arm, and it was, incidentally, almost as big as himself! Presumably he had broken its neck, just as other chimps had killed monkeys. In his free hand Huxley held a bunch of twigs and after each mouthful of meat he ate a few leaves—for all the world like a man with a lump of cheese and a stick of celery.

Gathered close round Huxley, and all begging, were three other large males—J. B., Hollis, and William. Several times Huxley tore off a piece of meat and put it into the outstretched hand of J. B. Once Hollis begged from J. B. and was rewarded with a small bloody splinter. When a youngster of about four years held out its hand, Huxley, after a moment, very gently cuffed it on the head, but a female with a tiny infant was allowed to feed from the carcass unmolested.

The sight of this female tucking it in proved too much for poor old William, who had been begging and begging in vain. He ventured to help himself to a bite. Evidently it was one thing for the mother to share in the spoil, but quite another when William tried to join in. Huxley at once grabbed William and bit him, at which J. B. came racing down and chased the screaming William from the tree.

There was a good deal of yelling and crashing around in the undergrowth, and then the two climbed back into the tree. They sat near Huxley, who at once hit William four or five times, after which J. B. did the same.

Poor William tried neither to escape nor to retaliate. He simply sat there screaming and took his medicine. And then he reached out to touch the lips of his punishers in the gesture of appeasement, and all was peaceful again. William was not forgiven, however, to the extent of a handout.

Raw meat, though obviously a great delicacy, is only an occasional supplement to the chimpanzee’s diet. Whether the apes deliberately set out to hunt for meat, or merely make kills because of opportunity, remains undetermined. I suspect the latter.

The bulk of the diet is, of course, vegetarian. I have collected 81 different types of vegetable foods eaten by chimpanzees, of which half consist of fruits, a quarter of leaves, and the remainder of seeds, blossoms, stems, and bark. (Follow one chimpanzee as he leaves a medical testing system.)

Epic discovery reveals a tool-maker

In addition, however, the chimpanzees sometimes feed on insects—at certain times of the year fairly extensively. I have seen them eating termites, two species of ant, and two types of gall, a tumorlike growth on a leaf in which the young gallfly lives. And it is this method adopted by the chimpanzees for feeding on ants and termites that probably represents the most important discovery in my two years of research.

For a long time there has been heated discussion in scientific circles as to whether any primates in the wild ever modify natural objects to make tools. My chimpanzees have settled the argument for once and for all: The answer is that at least some chimpanzees do.

Termites form a major part of the chimpanzee diet for a two-month period. The termite season starts at the beginning of the rains, when the fertile insects grow wings and are ready to leave the nest. At this time the passages are extended to the surface of the termite heap and then sealed lightly over while the insect awaits good flying weather. The chimpanzee is not alone in his state for termites—the baboon in particular has a fondness for the juicy insects, but he must wait until they fly and then take his turn, together with the birds, at grabbing the termites as they leave the nest.

The chimpanzee forestalls them all. He comes along, peers at the surface of the termite heap and, where he spies one of the sealed-entrances, scrapes away the thin layer of soil. Then he picks a straw or dried stem of grass and pokes this carefully down the hole. The termites, like miniature bulldogs, bite the straw and hang on grimly as it is gently withdrawn.

I have watched chimpanzees fish this way for two hours at a time, picking dainty morsels from the straw and munching them with delight. When they don’t have much luck with one hole, they open another and try again.

As the straw becomes bent at the end, the chimpanzee breaks off the bent pieces until the tool is too short for further use. Then it is discarded and a new one picked. Sometimes a leafy twig is selected, and before this can be used the chimpanzee has to strop off the leaves.

In doing so—in modifying a natural object to make it suitable for a specific purpose—the chimpanzee has reached the first crude beginnings of tool making.

Chimps carry tools on termite search

In this respect, the chimpanzees do not always await the discovery of a termite nest before seeking a tool. I have seen them break off a twig and carry it for as far as half a mile, going from one termite hill to another, though none at the time was suitable for feeding.

It is unlikely that this practice of fishing for termites is an inborn behavior pattern. Among higher primates, behavior is found to depend more and more on learned techniques and les and less on “instincts.” It seems almost certain that this method of eating termites is a social tradition, passed from ape to ape by watching and imitation. As such, it must be regarded as a crude and primitive culture.

We do not know yet if similar traditions have developed among other chimpanzee populations in Africa. The answer may throw interesting light on the spread and development of culture in early man.

Meat in diet poses questions

It is equally important to find out whether capture and eating of prey is common to all chimpanzees or peculiar to those of the Gombe Stream Reserve. Perhaps this is simply a local tradition, in which case there is always the possibility that it might develop and eventually involve more elaborate hunting techniques.

AT present these chimpanzees appear merely to take advantage of any good opportunity that presents itself for the killing of prey —as was perhaps the case with early man. It seems important that in the future recurring observations should be made of the meat-eating and hunting behavior of this chimpanzee population.

In the chimpanzee, there is reason to speculate that over-specialization has not led to an evolutionary dead end, as may be the case with the other great apes. Of course, if the forests of Africa were cleared for agriculture, the chimpanzee would not survive in competition with man. But if the forests gradually disappeared due to changing climate or similar causes, I think it is interesting to conjecture that the chimpanzee, with his primitive hunting and tool-using, might have a chance of survival, a chance of adapting himself to the new conditions.

There is still much to learn about the behavior of the free-ranging chimpanzee. I am returning to the Gombe Stream Reserve for a further six months, and again with the generous support of the National Geographic Society. After that I hope to make behavior studies in other parts of Africa, because, until we have sufficient comparative data, we cannot tell if the behavior of the Gombe Stream chimpanzees differs from those in other regions. Only after we have such data can we draw far-reaching conclusions about the way of life of the chimpanzee, which with the other great apes is the most nearly human of all the animals inhabiting the earth today.";Jane Goodall’s original tale of chimpanzees still astonishes today;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbWFnYXppbmUvMTk2My8wOC9qYW5lLWdvb2RhbGwtb3JpZ2luYWwtc3RvcnktY2hpbXBhbnplZXMtc3RpbGwtYXN0b25pc2hlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2019/04/jane-goodall-chimpanzees-1963/01-jane-goodall-chimpanzees-1963.adapt.1900.1.jpg;04/02/2019;"[{'sent': 'This story first appeared in the August 1963 issue of National Geographic magazine.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['National Geographic']}}, {'sent': 'Slowly and quietly, but making no attempt to hide, I moved toward the great apes until I was only 30 feet away.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['only 30 feet']}}, {'sent': 'View Images David Greybeard, a wild chimpanzee, gets a handout of bananas from author Goodall, who studies the apes under a National Geographic Society grant.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['David Greybeard', 'Goodall'], 'ORG': ['National Geographic Society']}}, {'sent': 'This scene near her camp represents a triumph for Miss Goodall; at first the animals fled if she came within 500 yards.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Goodall'], 'QUANTITY': ['500 yards']}}, {'sent': 'She carries a whistle in her pocket to summon searchers in case of accident in the rugged Tanganyika hills.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Tanganyika']}}, {'sent': 'Photograph by Baron Hugo van Lawick, National Geographic\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Hugo van Lawick'], 'ORG': ['National Geographic']}}, {'sent': 'One of the males stood upright to watch more closely.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['One']}}, {'sent': 'He was a superb specimen, standing about four and a half feet in height, his massive shoulders and bull neck suggesting the tremendous strength in his arms.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['about four and a half']}}, {'sent': 'He must have weighed a good 130 pounds, and he was strong enough to snap with one hand a branch so tough that a man would be hard put to break it with two.\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['a good 130 pounds'], 'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'After a moment or two, the group stopped looking my way, recognizing me for the strange hairless', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'The six adults rested on the ground or stretched out along the branches of a wild fig.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['six']}}, {'sent': 'Nearby, four youngsters played quietly.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['four']}}, {'sent': 'Photograph by Jane Goodall, National Geographic\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jane Goodall'], 'ORG': ['National Geographic']}}, {'sent': 'One by one the others followed, the infants riding astride their mothers’ backs like diminutive jockeys.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one', 'One']}}, {'sent': 'In England, before I commenced my field study, I met one or two people who had seen chimpanzees in the wild.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['England'], 'CARDINAL': ['two', 'one']}}, {'sent': 'View Images Gombe Stream Game Reserve spreads across 60 square miles of forested valleys and treeless ridges north of Kigoma, Tanganyika.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['60 square miles'], 'GPE': ['Kigoma', 'Tanganyika']}}, {'sent': 'Chimpanzees on the reserve belong to the subspecies Pan satyrus schweinfurthi.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Pan']}}, {'sent': 'Map by Irvin E.

There are a lot of things one can learn from animals - whether it’s their sense of brotherhood, being empathetic or just sharing. Take for example this chimp and tortoise that can teach everyone a lesson on sharing. A video of the two beings from completely different species of the animal kingdom will give you a sense of calm in an otherwise complex environment.

The clip shows a chimpanzee eating an apple. However, after a few moments it feeds the apple to the tortoise near him. The heartwarming scene between the two is melting netizens’ hearts.

“Give, even if you only have a little,” reads the caption.

A HUMILIATED chimpanzee has been filmed riding around the world's most hated zoo on a bike while spraying anti-coronavirus sanitiser.

The animal was recorded at the controversial Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo near Bangkok, Thailand, where bosses used the chimp to promote the work they are doing during the pandemic.

Shocking footage shows the intelligent animal wearing a surgical face mask, denim shorts and an orange Hawaiian shirt while pedalling a children's bicycle with a tank strapped to the back spraying disinfectant.

Animal rights investigators have previously documented more serious accounts of abuse at the zoo last year including animals being beaten with bamboo sticks.

The Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo sparked outrage last December when footage emerged of a painfully thin elephant being forced to perform tricks for crowds.

Campaigners say that other ""attractions"" at the zoo include emaciated elephants being abused, bears rocking nervously back-and-forth while stuck in filthy pools and malnourished crocodiles.

Regarding the chimpanzee disinfecting the zoo, farm director Uthen Yangpraphakorn said they had to keep the place clean to be ready to re-open as soon as the government eases Covid-19 coronavirus restrictions.

Uthen said: ""We have been closed since the government orders about the virus, so in the meantime, we do not have much to do.

""We clean the place two or three times a week in case the government will allow us to re-open, so we are ready to start accepting visitors again.

""The chimp was also trained in the farm so we just brought him out to let him stretch his limbs during this inactive period.""

Thailand has so far declared 2,643 Covid-19 coronavirus cases and 43 deaths.

The country has enforced strict measures to combat the pandemic including closing zoos and other businesses, banning passenger flights, imposing curfews, sweeping travel bans and alcohol prohibition.

Since the zoo came to light over the past few years, campaigners have been trying their best to stop degrading practices like this in the zoo that has a history of animal abuse and have it closed down.

Responding to the video of the chimp, animal rights group PETA said the treatment was ''heartbreaking'' and described the zoo as a ''hell hole''.

Spokesman Nirali Shah said: ''Places like Samutprakarn Crocodile Farm and Zoo are hellholes where animals like this chimpanzee endure miserable lives in captivity every single day.

''They are routinely mistreated and know little more than chains. When they're not used for human 'entertainment', they are held in cramped cages.''

Despite multiple attempts by PETA to contact Samutprakarn, the zoo's management has never responded.

PETA submitted the investigative findings to the Thai police and lodged an official complaint with authorities, urging them to inspect the zoo.

Animal rights groups have also pressured tour companies to stop taking holidaymakers to the enclosure just south of Bangkok.

Chinese firm Ctrip - Asia's biggest online booking agency that handles millions of holidaymakers a year - ditched the zoo in August 2019 and stopped selling tickets to the facility.

Yet despite mounting pressure the zoo continues to operate and animals are still held in appalling conditions.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"It’s a girl!

The Maryland Zoo in Baltimore welcomed a female baby chimpanzee last December.

Raven, a 24-year old chimp, became a first-time mom on Dec. 29. Zookeepers said the baby is her spitting image, with fluffy black hair that covers most of the body.

The baby spends most of her time cradled in Raven’s arms.

“The baby is gripping well and is very vocal,” Erin Cantwell, the zoo’s mammal collection and conservation manager, said in a statement.

Baby chimps’ developmental milestones are similar to human babies, and the baby’s keepers will monitor her successes, including ability to hold her head up on her own, using her fingers and toes to grasp things, learning vocalizations and facial expressions, and teething, the zoo said in a news release.

Raven is the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo recently. In July, Bunny gave birth to Lola.

Chimpanzee gestation is about eight months long, and the zoo conducts prenatal care for the animals once there is a positive pregnancy test.

Chimpanzees are classified as endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s Red list. Wild chimpanzees face loss of their African forest habitat from commercial logging, agriculture and fires, as well as poaching and disease.

There are 14 chimpanzees in the Maryland Zoo, including the newborn. They can be seen daily, but Raven and her baby will remain behind the scenes for a while to allow them to bond.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"MONKEY World has welcomed its latest arrival – Kalu the chimpanzee.

The 37-year-old primate had lived at Broadlands Stud, the South African estate of the renowned racehorse trainer Pat Cavendish O'Neill.

Pat, who died last year, built up a menagerie of wild animals at Broadlands. Kalu was kept at the stud farm in Somerset West, Cape Town, for more than 30 years following her capture from the wild in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire.

Kalu also featured predominantly in O'Neill's written memoirs, 'A Chimpanzee in the Wine Cellar'.

PICTURES: Monkey World through the years

Monkey World director Dr Alison Cronin said “Despite not having contact with her own kind since she was stolen from the wild as a baby, Kalu is reacting calmly and happily to the attentions of the new group.

""It shows how much chimpanzees want and need to be with other of their own kind regardless of how long they have lived alone.

""This is the story of so many of our rescued chimps at the park.”

Since O'Neill's death Kalu had been looked after by South Africa's Monkey Town Primate Centre, who contacted Monkey World to see if she could finally find a family of her own kind at the Dorset primate rescue centre.

However, her trip to the UK was not without drama. Monkey World says the chimpanzee was held for ransom over a financial dispute with the O'Neill estate.

A Monkey World spokesman said: ""Kalu’s rescue was jeopardised when the Monkey World team were prevented from entering the Broadlands Farm on the day they were due to move her.

""Negotiations between the landowner and the O’Neill Trust and estate got the team to Kalu but not before they missed their flight out of Cape Town.

""Monkey World director Dr Alison Cronin, animal director Jeremy Keeling, and specialist wildlife veterinarian Dr John Lewis made the epic trip back to the UK, with the chimpanzee on board the same flight, 24 hours later.""

On arrival in the UK, Dr Cronin and the team quickly settled Kalu into life at the park, living alongside her new family, a community of five other chimpanzees including three others which have also been smuggled from the wild and used in circuses and as photographer’s props in Cyprus, Mexico, and Thailand.";Meet Kalu the chimpanzee, the latest arrival at Monkey World;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvdXJuZW1vdXRoZWNoby5jby51ay9uZXdzLzE4Mjk2NjQyLm1lZXQta2FsdS1jaGltcGFuemVlLWxhdGVzdC1hcnJpdmFsLW1vbmtleS13b3JsZC_SATRodHRwczovL3d3dy5ib3VybmVtb3V0aGVjaG8uY28udWsvbmV3cy8xODI5NjY0Mi5hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/resources/images/11137245/;03/11/2020;"[{'sent': 'MONKEY World has welcomed its latest arrival – Kalu the chimpanzee.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['MONKEY World']}}, {'sent': ""The 37-year-old primate had lived at Broadlands Stud, the South African estate of the renowned racehorse trainer Pat Cavendish O'Neill.\n\n"", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Broadlands Stud', ""Pat Cavendish O'Neill""]}}, {'sent': 'Pat, who died last year, built up a menagerie of wild animals at Broadlands.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Pat'], 'ORG': ['Broadlands']}}, {'sent': 'Kalu was kept at the stud farm in Somerset West, Cape Town, for more than 30 years following her capture from the wild in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Kalu'], 'GPE': ['Cape Town', 'the Democratic Republic of Congo', 'Zaire', 'Somerset West']}}, {'sent': ""Kalu also featured predominantly in O'Neill's written memoirs, 'A Chimpanzee in the Wine Cellar'.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Kalu', ""O'Neill""]}}, {'sent': 'Monkey World director Dr Alison Cronin said “Despite not having contact with her own kind since she was stolen from the wild as a baby, Kalu is reacting calmly and happily to the attentions of the new group.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Monkey World'], 'PERSON': ['Kalu', 'Alison Cronin']}}, {'sent': ""Since O'Neill's death Kalu had been looked after by South Africa's Monkey Town Primate Centre, who contacted Monkey World to see if she could finally find a family of her own kind at the Dorset primate rescue centre.\n\n"", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Kalu', ""O'Neill""], 'GPE': ['Dorset', ""South Africa's""], 'ORG': ['Monkey World', 'Monkey Town Primate Centre']}}, {'sent': 'However, her trip to the UK was not without drama.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['UK']}}, {'sent': ""Monkey World says the chimpanzee was held for ransom over a financial dispute with the O'Neill estate.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': [""O'Neill"", 'Monkey World']}}, {'sent': 'A Monkey World spokesman said: ""', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Monkey World']}}, {'sent': 'Kalu’s rescue was jeopardised when the Monkey World team were prevented from entering the Broadlands Farm on the day they were due to move her.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Kalu', 'the Broadlands Farm', 'Monkey World']}}, {'sent': '""Negotiations between the landowner and the O’Neill Trust and estate got the team to Kalu but not before they missed their flight out of Cape Town.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Kalu', 'the O’Neill Trust'], 'GPE': ['Cape Town']}}, {'sent': '""Monkey World director Dr Alison Cronin, animal director Jeremy Keeling, and specialist wildlife veterinarian Dr John Lewis made the epic trip back to the UK, with the chimpanzee on board the same flight, 24 hours later.""\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['John Lewis', 'Jeremy Keeling', 'Alison Cronin'], 'GPE': ['UK']}}, {'sent': 'On arrival in the UK, Dr Cronin and the team quickly settled Kalu into life at the park, living alongside her new family, a community of five other chimpanzees including three others which have also been smuggled from the wild and used in circuses and', 'ents': {'GPE': ['UK'], 'PERSON': ['Cronin', 'Kalu'], 'CARDINAL': ['three', 'five']}}, {'sent': 'as photographer’s props in Cyprus, Mexico, and Thailand.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Thailand', 'Mexico', 'Cyprus']}}]"
@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Freud, Wilkie and the other chimpanzees peacefully fed and rested in the sun-dappled Tanzanian forest. Mzee Hilali stood next to me, writing notes on the chimpanzees’ behavior, as he had been doing for over 30 years as a field assistant for Jane Goodall’s long-term study at Gombe National Park.

Suddenly, a strange, high-pitched call sounded from where some other chimpanzees were feeding, about a hundred meters from us. Hilali turned to me, and with a little laugh, said, “Nyoka.” This was the Swahili word for “snake.”

Freud climbed down from his tree and walked quickly toward where the call had sounded, with Hilali following close behind. As I slowly made my way through the undergrowth to catch up with them, Hilali called to me: “Chatu!” “Python!”

When I caught up with Hilali, he was pointing to a tangled mass of leaves and vines on the forest floor. I looked closely – most of the snake lay hidden from view, but the one visible stretch of black and tan scaly hide was too big to be anything but a python.

From years of experience, Mzee Hilali knew instantly that this particular chimp call meant they’d found a snake. Does this mean that chimpanzees have a “word” for snake? Do chimpanzees have a language of their own? I’ve been working with a team of students and Tanzanian field assistants to record and analyze chimpanzee vocalizations in an effort to answer questions like this. Ultimately we hope to learn more about how human language first evolved.

Clues to the origins of language

Chimpanzees are among human beings’ closest living relatives, and they share with us many unusual traits. Like humans, chimps make and use tools; join together in groups to hunt animals like monkeys; defend group territories; and sometimes gang up on and kill their enemies.

One trait that seems to set humans apart from every other species, however, is a fully developed language. Other animals communicate, but only humans appear able to talk about an unlimited variety of topics. Language enables us to make plans, negotiate with and teach one another.

How and why language evolved remains a mystery. Much of the evidence of human evolution comes from fossils, but fossil bones don’t tell us much about soft tissues or the sounds early human ancestors made. Studying the communication patterns of our living relatives can help solve the mystery.

If some features of chimpanzee communication resemble language, we can study chimpanzees further to find clues for why those features evolved. If chimpanzee communication doesn’t share much in common with human language, then the key steps in language evolution must have occurred after our lineages separated (around 7.9 million years ago) for reasons unique to our human lineage.

Recording in the forest

To investigate chimp communication, my colleagues and I follow chimpanzees through the forest as they go about their lives. We carry a hand-held “shotgun” microphone and a digital recorder, waiting for them to call.

Usually we pick a particular chimp to follow each day, trying to get equal numbers of calls per individual. In addition to recording new calls, we’ve been working to build an archive of recordings from other researchers, going back to the 1970s. The archive currently contains over 71 hours of recordings.

Snake alarm calls are intriguing, but because chimps don’t encounter large snakes very often, it is hard to do a systematic study of them. (Cathy Crockford and colleagues have done some interesting experiments, though, playing back recordings of these calls to see how chimpanzees respond and presenting them with model snakes). One thing chimpanzees do every single day, though, is eat. Chimpanzees spend most of their time looking for food and eating it. And when they find food, they often give a particular kind of call: the rough-grunt.

A chimpanzee rough-grunt.

Biologist Lisa O'Bryan studied rough-grunt calls for her dissertation research with me. They vary from low, noisy grunts to higher-pitched calls. Some researchers have proposed an intriguing possibility: Maybe chimpanzees make distinct kinds of rough-grunt calls in response to particular foods, rather like words that name certain food items.

But Lisa has found that when eating any one kind of food, chimpanzees can produce a range of different rough-grunts. Rough-grunts thus tell other chimps that the caller is eating, but they don’t say what’s for dinner.

Just as a particular alarm call informs others that a snake has been found, the thin, wavering tones of a copulation scream announce that a mating has just taken place.

Author provided 14.6 KB (download) A chimpanzee copulation scream.

Why female chimpanzees sometimes give such a scream just as they finish mating remains unknown. Because the data collected by Mzee Hilali and other field assistants since the 1970s have been entered into a computer database, we can readily examine thousands of different mating events.

My student Tony Massaro has been analyzing these data to try to tease out what factors make females more likely to produce these calls. Such calls aren’t particularly word-like, but they do play an important role in communication. Like many wordless sounds that people make – think laughter, screams and crying – listeners hearing the sounds can infer quite a bit about the caller’s situation.

When Jane Goodall gives public talks, she often begins by giving a pant-hoot: a loud call that begins with an introduction, followed by a build-up, a climax and a let-down. Pant-hoots are loud and enable chimpanzees to communicate over long distances through the forest.

Previous studies have found differences in the pant-hoots calls from different regions. For example, the pant-hoots from Gombe sound a bit different from those made by chimpanzees in Mahale, 160 km away. When I played recordings of a single Mahale pant-hoot call to chimpanzees in Kibale Forest, Uganda, the Kibale chimpanzees acted as if they had just heard an intruder. If they were in a group with three or more males, they gave a loud vocal response and rapidly moved towards the speaker.

If they were in a group with only one or two males present, though, they stayed quiet, and if they approached, did so slowly and cautiously.

For chimpanzees, correctly telling friend from foe is a matter of life or death, so it would make sense for chimpanzees in neighboring groups to have distinctive pant-hoot calls.

Cathy Crockford and colleagues found that pant-hoots from different communities within Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire, also sound distinct. If such group-level differences result from vocal learning, they would be rather like dialects in human languages.

My student Nisarg Desai has been testing whether this is also the case at Gombe. We’ve been working with a team of Tanzanian field assistants, Hashimu Issa Salala and Nasibu Zuberi Madumbi, to record calls from the Mitumba and Kasekela chimpanzees, and are starting to test for differences between groups.

We are in the early stages of this analysis.

From calls to language isn’t a clear path

Chimpanzees might be capable of some degree of vocal learning, but I’m struck by how subtle the differences in pant-hoot calls are from place to place. Chimpanzees make lots of different calls – pant-hoots, pant-barks, waa-barks, pant-grunts, rough-grunts, and so on – but across Africa, all chimpanzees produce a pretty similar set of calls in similar circumstances. In this respect, chimpanzee calls resemble human sounds like laughter and crying more than they resemble human words, which can vary drastically from place to place.

Chimpanzees communicate effectively with their various sounds, but in ways quite similar to those of other nonhuman primates. This suggests that our common ancestor with chimpanzees also had a fairly typical repertoire of vocal communication for a nonhuman primate. The really big changes in human language – such as a lifelong ability to learn to make entirely new sounds and a rich symbolic meaning of such sounds – likely evolved later, for reasons that we still don’t understand.";Studying chimpanzee calls for clues about the origins of human language;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEJ4Wg5MITN8rZXWvntumorYqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowzLvzCjDzxNMCMNuspgU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://images.theconversation.com/files/218089/original/file-20180508-34006-g309sg.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C31%2C998%2C498&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop;05/08/2018;"[{'sent': 'Freud, Wilkie and the other chimpanzees peacefully fed and rested in the sun-dappled Tanzanian forest.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Wilkie']}}, {'sent': 'Mzee Hilali stood next to me, writing notes on the chimpanzees’ behavior, as he had been doing for over 30 years as a field assistant for Jane Goodall’s long-term study at Gombe National Park.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jane Goodall']}}, {'sent': 'Suddenly, a strange, high-pitched call sounded from where some other chimpanzees were feeding, about a hundred meters from us.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['about a hundred meters']}}, {'sent': 'This was the Swahili word for “snake.”\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Swahili']}}, {'sent': 'Freud climbed down from his tree and walked quickly toward where the call had sounded, with Hilali following close behind.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Freud']}}, {'sent': 'As I slowly made my way through the undergrowth to catch up with them, Hilali called to me: “Chatu!”', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Chatu', 'Hilali']}}, {'sent': '“Python!”\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Python']}}, {'sent': 'One trait that seems to set humans apart from every other species, however, is a fully developed language.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['One']}}, {'sent': '(Cathy Crockford and colleagues have done some interesting experiments, though, playing back recordings of these calls to see how chimpanzees respond and presenting them with model snakes).', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Cathy Crockford']}}, {'sent': 'One thing chimpanzees do every single day, though, is eat.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['One']}}, {'sent': ""Biologist Lisa O'Bryan studied rough-grunt calls for her dissertation research with me."", 'ents': {'PERSON': [""Lisa O'Bryan""]}}, {'sent': 'But Lisa has found that when eating any one kind of food, chimpanzees can produce a range of different rough-grunts.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Lisa'], 'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'Because the data collected by Mzee Hilali and other field assistants since the 1970s have been entered into a computer database, we can readily examine thousands of different mating events.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Mzee Hilali'], 'CARDINAL': ['thousands']}}, {'sent': 'My student Tony Massaro has been analyzing these data to try to tease out what factors make females more likely to produce these calls.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Tony Massaro']}}, {'sent': 'When Jane Goodall gives public talks, she often begins by giving a pant-hoot: a loud call that begins with an introduction, followed by a build-up, a climax and a let-down.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jane Goodall']}}, {'sent': 'For example, the pant-hoots from Gombe sound a bit different from those made by chimpanzees in Mahale, 160 km away.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Gombe'], 'ORG': ['Mahale'], 'QUANTITY': ['160 km']}}, {'sent': 'When I played recordings of a single Mahale pant-hoot call to chimpanzees in Kibale Forest, Uganda, the Kibale chimpanzees acted as if they had just heard an intruder.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Kibale Forest', 'Mahale'], 'GPE': ['Uganda', 'Kibale']}}, {'sent': 'If they were in a group with three or more males, they gave a loud vocal response and rapidly moved towards the speaker.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['three']}}, {'sent': 'If they were in a group with only one or two males present, though, they stayed quiet, and if they approached, did so slowly and cautiously.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['only one', 'two']}}, {'sent': 'For chimpanzees, correctly telling friend from foe is a matter of life or death, so it would make sense for chimpanzees in neighboring groups to have distinctive pant-hoot calls.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['foe']}}, {'sent': ""Cathy Crockford and colleagues found that pant-hoots from different communities within Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire, also sound distinct."", 'ents': {'PERSON': [""Côte d'Ivoire"", 'Cathy Crockford'], 'ORG': ['Taï Forest']}}, {'sent': 'My student Nisarg Desai has been testing whether this is also the case at Gombe.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Nisarg Desai'], 'PERSON': ['Gombe']}}, {'sent': 'We’ve been working with a team of Tanzanian field assistants, Hashimu Issa Salala and Nasibu Zuberi Madumbi, to record calls from the Mitumba and Kasekela chimpanzees, and are starting to test for differences between groups.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Hashimu Issa Salala', 'Nasibu Zuberi Madumbi', 'Kasekela'], 'GPE': ['Mitumba']}}]"
@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"A still from 'The Last Chimpanzee' showing Eli on the set of 'Zero.' As the chimp reached adolescence and had more outbursts, he worked on a greenscreen away from human actors.

As CGI replaces live animals, Eli the chimpanzee — whose résumé includes a TBS show and a One Direction video — retired last year but has yet to find a long-term facility. An upcoming documentary will tell his story.

From Ronald Reagan co-star Bonzo to the Today show's J. Fred Muggs and Bear in B.J. and the Bear, chimpanzees have been appearing in movies and on TV for more than eight decades. That all but came to an end in 2018, the year that Eli, the last chimpanzee professionally trained to act in Hollywood, appeared in his final movie, the Bollywood film Zero. Eli — whose key trick was taking someone's glasses and putting them on — is now awaiting placement in a forever home.

Having been let go by Working Wildlife (which specializes in providing exotic species for entertainment productions), he was dropped off in March at a financially struggling nonprofit sanctuary near Angeles National Forest, just outside of Los Angeles. The facility shut down in August, and Eli and more than 40 other chimps, many of whom arrived from research labs, have since been under the on-site care of the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. ""We are currently in discussion with a high-quality facility that may provide a permanent home for Eli,"" says Kirsten Macintyre, a spokeswoman for the state agency.

The 9-year-old chimpanzee's transition out of the business, as typically occurs when the species reaches adolescence, is part of a larger trend away from using real wild creatures to ""act"" onscreen. (While chimps, orangutans and elephants are being phased out, it's still mostly business as usual for species like big cats and bears.)

A mix of factors accounts for the shift, including the adoption of believable CGI (Planet of the Apes, The Lion King) as well as high-profile credibility issues involving the industry's on-set animal watchdog, the American Humane Association. Arguably the strongest influence has been a relentless pressure campaign by animal-rights activists. ""They made it happen,"" observes Barbara Casey, the head of another industry regulator, Movie Animals Protected.

Eli — who appeared in commercials (Microsoft), music videos (One Direction) and the occasional TV show (TBS' Angie Tribeca) — saw his own output curbed by the effort, with a Geico ad pulled and scenes from a season of MasterChef Junior cut. PETA primate expert Debbie Metzler is proud of the result. ""A decade ago, there were at least a dozen chimpanzees working,"" she says. ""Now there are zero.""

At least, there are zero with Hollywood training. Productions willing to risk the ire of activists can still secure chimps from several private companies around the country that teach them circus-style tricks. These include Chance, who appeared opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street.

To conceptual artist Alex Israel, whose practice often probes the mechanics of the entertainment business, including its props and sets, Eli represents the end of an era. For one project, Israel photographed Eli in a Malibu mansion, interacting with other artists' works — including Damien Hirst's pickled, vitrine-based piece Black Sheep. ""He definitely connected with it, looking up close through the glass, interested in what it was and why it was there,"" notes Israel. On Jan. 15, at the Gagosian Gallery in London, Israel will unveil a portrait of himself with Eli that references the Jeff Koons sculpture Michael Jackson and Bubbles. Israel calls Eli ""really such a star, full of charisma,"" adding that the chimpanzee loved candy. ""I think they fed him M&Ms or Skittles or gumdrops. He would be given candy as a reward for holding still for a photo or doing a trick.""

Eli, who was born at a commercial breeding facility in Missouri, also is the subject of an upcoming documentary, The Last Chimpanzee, from director Tanner Kling of Retrofit Films. He met the animal on the set of a shortform series that had been slated for Verizon Go90 before the streamer went belly-up. Kling went on to follow him through production on the Bollywood film, now available on Netflix. Says Kling of Eli, ""His strength as a performer was a gentle, easygoing nature.""

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The government of Nigeria’s Ekiti state has issued an executive order establishing a conservation area within the Ise Forest Reserve, where about 20 Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzees are believed to survive.

With perhaps as few as 3,500 left in the wild, the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee faces threats including hunting, logging and forest clearing for agriculture across its range.

Upgrading the reserve to a conservation area will put stricter forest-protection measures in place.

Before doing so, conservationists say they will work to gain the consent and support of forest-dependent communities in the area.

Nigeria’s Ekiti state government has moved to establish a conservation area within the Ise Forest Reserve, an important step toward protecting the habitat of the Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes ellioti).

The 46-square-kilometer (18-square-mile) forest reserve is deemed an important priority site for the subspecies, the most threatened type of chimpanzee. Its total population, which occurs in the forested border areas of Nigeria and Cameroon, is projected to number between 3,500 and 9,000 in the wild. Fewer than 20 individuals are believed to survive in Ise, distributed across an area of 32 km2 (12 mi2).

While already established as a reserve, the Ise Forest is surrounded by farmland and human settlements, and is grappling with heavy logging and land clearing for farms and illegal marijuana cultivation. Nigeria’s National Drug Law Enforcement Agency said it destroyed 400 acres, about 160 hectares, of marijuana plantations in Ise Forest in late 2014; a year later, it discovered 2,000 cannabis farms in Ise and Ogotun, another town in Ekiti state.

Encroachment is a problem in forest reserves throughout Nigeria’s chimpanzee habitats. These reserves, which are controlled by state governments, are established to promote the controlled use of resources rather than as strictly protected areas. They often are poorly monitored, leaving them vulnerable to logging, hunting for bushmeat and for traditional ritual medicines, and clearing for farming and human settlements. Underfunded and understaffed forestry departments struggle to tackle these problems.

Rachel Ashegbofe Ikemeh, project director of The South-West/Niger Delta Forest Project (SWNDF), which pushed for the establishment of a conservation area in Ise, says she hopes the forest’s upgraded status will protect the forest from these dangers. This will not just aid chimpanzees, she says, but also improve the outcome for other plant and animal species in this highly biodiverse ecosystem.

“The results we are hoping to see in the next few years are simple — good quality habitat, thriving wildlife populations — basically an improved version of what is obtainable in the forest reserve today, all things being equal,” Ikemeh tells Mongabay.

The exact size and location of the conservation area has yet to be determined. Since March 11, when the state government issued an executive order establishing the conservation zone and indicating that it was willing to ultimately transfer authority to SWNDF, the group has conducted a preliminary assessment. It is also working to attract partner organizations with the expertise and resources to effectively manage the areas, and to work with local communities to gain their support.

In her 2013 survey of chimpanzees in Ise Forest and the Idandre forest cluster, a 2,159-km2 (834-mi2) swath of forest reserves in the neighboring state of Ondo, Ikemeh conjectured that the chimpanzee population had likely declined by more than 60% since 2000.

Chimpanzees are “heavily threatened,” she says, warning that without immediate action the “populations may never stand the chance of recovery.”

Key to protection efforts, Ikemeh says, is the recruitment and training of “committed individuals as eco-guards/rangers then instituting a patrol and enforcement regime.”

“However, prior to this, is to ensure that a free, prior and informed consent is duly conducted … to ensure we carry the border communities along every step to guarantee a significant level of cooperation,” she says.

Implementing strict conservation measures can come as a blow to forest-dependent communities. Ikemeh and her team are working to assess the needs of communities living adjacent to the reserve, and to hold discussions with them to explore alternative livelihood projects.

“However, we also expect that there’s no amount of support we are going to provide that will completely deter everyone from attempting to exploit the forests within the conservation area,” she says. “That’s why there will also be attention paid to effective law enforcement.”

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"It’s been three weeks of lockdown in Paris. The street outside my window seems smaller and emptier every day, as if people are more and more afraid to venture out. The French government recently announced even stricter measures: only one outing allowed per day, one hour per outing, within a 1-kilometer radius of home. The world outside my window is, in fact, getting smaller.

I feel as if I’m almost exclusively a father now, and no longer a writer. Writing matters less than making sure my 3-year-old son sees this new reality as some kind of adventure.

We go outside once a day, for a short walk or a ride on his scooter. At home, we make up games — snapping off the shoots of spinach leaves, learning to pick up scraps of paper with tweezers, creating complex designs on the floor with his collection of used metro tickets.

As I see it now, my primary occupation is keeping everything that’s going on as far away from him as possible — the lockdown, the virus, the uncertainty, the overall sense of panic, the soaring number of sick and dead. And for the most part I’d succeeded. Or so I thought.

Some days ago, I showed my son a short video with a scene of a chimpanzee clinging to Jane Goodall in what appears to be a grateful embrace. I explained that the chimpanzee’s name was Wounda, and that Goodall and her team were releasing Wounda back into the jungle of the Congo after it had been rehabilitated.

As soon as the video ended, my son started to sob inconsolably. At first I was almost proud of his tears, which I interpreted as empathy or emotional intelligence. And maybe they were. But then I couldn’t help but wonder how much built-up frustration he also was releasing in those tears, how much sadness he’d been storing up all week, and hiding from his father.

A few days have passed since he saw the video, but he still talks constantly about Dr. Goodall — he calls her Jane — and about Wounda. This afternoon, while we were trying to nap, he again told me Wounda’s story in his own way, in his own words.

And as I listened to him, I thought of a woman and her team healing a chimpanzee, and a chimpanzee healing a son, and a son healing a father.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"LONDON — When trying to get to the bottom of what being human means, we often recruit animals. From scheming, fatally flawed beasts that populate folktales, to the anthropomorphizing of pets by their owners, to the digitized emoticons and avatars in our phones, animals become our unwitting doppelgängers.

In the post-atomic era, apes emerged as our preferred understudy. In the sci-fi masterpiece Planet of the Apes (1968) orangutans, gorillas, and monkeys stand in for humans and cast a complicated light on our hierarchical, technocratic, and dystopian culture. The Naked Ape (1967), another global best-seller from this era, was zoologist Desmond Morris’s speculative anthropological study in which apes’ body language and mating rituals highlight corresponding behaviors in humans. While Morris’s text has long since been eclipsed by the more rigorous scholarship about simians by fellow Brit Jane Goodall, Morris pioneered multiple studies on the art-making impulse in animals, especially paintings and drawings created by a prolific chimpanzee from The London Zoo named Congo. Morris has put these works up for public sale and they’re on display in The Mayor Gallery’s current exhibition Congo the Chimpanzee: The Birth of Art.

This is not Congo’s artistic debut. Many “Congos” were originally exhibited at London’s Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1957, which led to the monkey’s art being snatched up by admiring peers such as Pablo Picasso and Joan Miró. But Congo, like many an Abstract Expressionist in his time, quickly faded from the annals of postwar art. This neglect is rectified by The Mayor Gallery’s generous gathering of some 55 Congo works, including oil and pastel paintings and drawings.

From 1955 to 1959, chaperoned and occasionally recorded on live television by Morris, Congo sat at a small desk for painting “sessions” that ran for about 15 minutes each. During this artistic zenith he created over 400 artworks, independently choosing colors, patterns, and themes, and deciding when the picture was finished by refusing to continue until Morris provided him with a new, clean sheet of paper.

Like artworks made by very young children and those experiencing psychoses, Congo’s work makes us believe in the much maligned concept of originality in art. Functioning beyond cultural influence, Congo was a proto-Modernist. He never fretted about his work’s debt to Surrealism or Cubism, nor was he anxiously gazing over his hairy shoulder at his most obvious stylistic peers, for instance, Joan Mitchell or Cy Twombly. And judging from the range of pictures at The Mayor Gallery, there are signs of artistic development, even in his short-lived arc.

In his first sessions, he made spare, stray marks that did not qualify as complete pictures. But Morris reports that without coercion or direction, Congo became ever more focused. That willfulness and concentration has been documented in studio photographs of the chimp manipulating paintbrushes, sometimes wielding two at a time, to execute balanced and cohesive compositions, which he held up and scrutinized at various stages of completion.

As represented by the works at The Mayor Gallery, his palette preferences tend toward primary and secondary colors — various reds, yellows, and greens. Yet the chimp seems mindful about complementary tones and hues. In some paintings, yellows are juxtaposed with greens; in others, bold blues are softened by adjoining or overlapping squibs of white or black and, in even more bold flourishes, by deep pinks and lush purples. And like homo sapien peers during this period, Congo occasionally painted only in black and white, testing the inherent plasticity produced through gestural painting.

Thematically speaking, Congo’s abstractions fall roughly into three species: impassioned vortexes, exquisite fan patterns, and calligraphic arrangements. Some pictures look like twisted trees while others suggest a jungle’s entangled undergrowth. In one series, repeated pale green brushstrokes resemble palm fronds, very nearly representing them. But such readings could be facile biographical interpretations which Congo-the-pure-abstractionist might rebut with outraged howls and whoops.

Still, it is tempting to translate Congo’s abstractions into realistic terms. Especially in his drawings, scissoring and elongated flourishes seem to verge on a kind of script. What, we might ask, is he communicating to us, or to himself? In one very spare drawing reproduced in Mayor’s Congo catalogue raisonné, the artist seems to make an attempt at drawing a human face.

Though short-lived, Congo’s art career ended, ironically, with a postmodern bang. According to Morris’s catalogue essay, Congo soon recoiled against the bourgeois orderliness of these painting sessions and, like an auto-destructive artist ahead of his time, the chimp began “to obliterate the sheets of paper with large masses of paint.”

All this monkey business at The Mayor Gallery takes us from wild aesthetic conjectures to sobering ethical dilemmas around animal agency, art ownership, and basic rights of living creatures. We might wonder, is Congo more a circus elephant or a simian Vincent van Gogh? Take the recent case around a selfie snapped by a macaque ape in Indonesia, which raised the thorny question about who owns the copyright to an artwork created by an animal, even when the means or conditions for creating that artwork are furnished by a human being? In response to many such incidents, animal rights advocates have argued for recognizing personhood for simians.

Such quandaries — and a good many more — underpin Alfred Fidjestøl’s absorbing new study, Almost Human: The Story of Julius, the Chimpanzee Caught Between Two Worlds (Greystone Books, 2019), a timely book in light of Congo’s artistic resurgence.

Born in 1979 in The Kristiansand Zoo in southern Norway, Julius, who turns 40 in the next few weeks, was inexplicably rejected by his birth mother and, immediately afterward, beaten nearly to death by another chimp. Young Julius was ferried to safety in the homes and families of various zookeepers who nursed him back to health for almost a full year. Monitored by the news media, Julius became an overnight sensation in Norway and remained a celebrity there throughout the 1980s. While living in human company, Julius adopted their rhythms and habits, sleeping in a bed made from a cardboard box and waking early to play with his human “sisters,” engineering new games with them, moving his food bowl on the floor as if it were a toy car.

This impulse toward interactive play emerges as a recurring human-chimpanzee link in Almost Human. While being tickled, Julius would feign intolerance while enjoying it; when beginning a race with his human siblings, he suspiciously monitored his competitors’ positions to ensure no one took off before the starting bell. And, as Fidjestøl makes clear, Julius’s mirroring behavior parallels that of an equally famous chimp named Lucy who lived with an Oklahoma couple in the 1970s and who also began to adopt human culture as her own — using silverware, learning sign language, selecting clothing to wear, drinking a boozy cocktail now and then, flipping through magazines and, after she reached puberty, masturbating to images in Playgirl.

But like Lucy, who was returned to a chimp community in Gambia where she remained an alienated, depressed outsider unable to bond with peers, so too Julius’s youthful immersion in human culture had a detrimental effect on the animal’s adulthood.

By painstakingly narrating Julius’s troubled reintegration with fellow chimps at the zoo, Fidjestøl debunks any naiveté readers might harbor about chimpanzees who, we learn, have sharp teeth capable of easily biting off a finger and arm strength 15 times stronger than that of an athletic adult human male. And unlike the far less aggressive and much more sexually open-minded bonobo species of apes, chimpanzees are patriarchal and tribal, and, at times, unpredictably violent toward one another, even as they demonstrate acute proficiencies like photographic memory, impassioned empathy, and vigorous creativity.

As its reflective title suggests, Almost Human develops its drama around regrets and anxieties about Julius’s welfare that bedevil his human caretakers, inside the zoo and beyond it, as they become both antagonists and protagonists in the chimp’s rocky development. Moreover, Julius’s plight reflects subtly on universal human predicaments, such as choosing domesticity over spontaneity, togetherness over individuality, recognition versus seclusion.

Though Fidjestøl goes easy on homo sapiens, a subtext is how lousy a species we are. We continue to destroy chimps through hunting and poaching while laying waste to their natural habitats through our greed. In 1979, when Julius was born, there were one million chimpanzees in the wild. Today, according to Fidjestøl, there may be less than 200,000.

And Julius is conscripted into the zoo’s image makeover. The Kristiansand Zoo expands into an amusement park and upgrades its grounds to accommodate the growing push for animal rights. Having painted sporadically alongside his human counterparts when small, in the late 1990s, the adult Julius is given a paintbrush again at the behest of his handlers and creates images that are sold to raise funds for the zoo. Though the incident has an unpleasant commercial stench to it, Julius’s artwork indicates that the chimp had the potential to be as interesting, though somewhat more conservative an artist, as his more prolific predecessor, Congo.

Fidjestøl closes Almost Human with meditations on Julius’s receptivity and openness, relating notes by his early caretaker, Billy Glad, who studies the young chimp’s gaze, noting, “You [Julius] have such a serious face, little man — like an old man. You look so wise, so quizzical. And yet your gaze is clear and open.” At its best, the passage sums up what humans seek out in animals and in art, as well as in animal-made art — a disquieting and empathetic encounter with the nonhuman, of which we are also a part. Such encounters temporarily free us from civilization’s sedative effects, and startle our consciousness about the improbable, fundamental fact that we too are animals and we exist.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"This video of a fist-bumping chimpanzee has made the rounds all over Twitter. While some viewers may think it’s “cute,” PETA thinks everyone would feel different if they knew this primate’s story.

The chimpanzee is believed to be a male named Sugriva. That name may ring a bell. Earlier this year, we let readers know how the notorious roadside zoo Myrtle Beach Safari exploits him on a regular basis for social media clout.

If you’re unfamiliar with Sugriva’s story, he was torn away from his mother as an infant—like most primates used for entertainment and encounters with humans. In his early years, trainers likely kept him under the constant threat of physical punishment in order to ensure that he “performed” whenever humans wanted him to.

Throughout his entire life, he’s been paraded around as though he were nothing more than a prop for publicity stunts.

Myrtle Beach Safari treats its animals like inanimate party equipment. Handlers have used Sugriva as a photo prop for tourists at a mall, passing him along from stranger to stranger. His brother, Vali, has even been forced to “play football” with an NFL athlete in one Instagram video.

Experiences like these are unnatural and likely confusing and frightening for a young chimpanzee who should be living in the forest with his family. At Myrtle Beach Safari, these animals have no choices or free will. Their lives are valued only relative to how much money they bring in for the roadside zoo.

For decades, PETA has worked to shut down the sleazy Myrtle Beach Safari. We want the numerous exotic animals held there to be moved to reputable sanctuaries.

Operator and owner Bhagavan “Doc” Antle has a long history of violating the federal Animal Welfare Act, including by endangering the public and by failing to provide animals with needed veterinary care, sufficient cage space, and clean water. He’s also been cited for keeping animals in dangerous, dilapidated enclosures. In 2014, he came under fire from PETA for a shameless—and dangerous—stunt in which he took two chimpanzees to a screening of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.

Refuse to give money to anyone who would exploit animals in cheap, publicity-driven stunts.

Myrtle Beach Safari is just one of countless roadside zoos that abuse animals for harmful hands-on encounters, photo ops, and clout-chasing videos. PETA urges everyone to stay away from animal circuses, roadside zoos, and all other operations in which animals suffer for the gain of cruel people.

Officials ordered Samutprakan Crocodile Farm and Zoo—a shady Thai facility—to shape up after it forced a masked, leashed chimpanzee to ride around on a bike and spray disinfectant in an apparent attempt to capitalize on the coronavirus crisis.

While we’re thankful that authorities put the kibosh on the cruel stunt, it’s not nearly good enough. As a PETA video exposé revealed last year, animals kept at Samutprakan Zoo are abused for entertainment in other ways, too. Eyewitnesses observed crocodiles being struck with poles, tigers harassed into performing and being in photos with tourists, and primates whose basic needs were neglected.

Please, never support animal shows or exhibits.

The heartbreaking stunt took place at Samutprakan Crocodile Farm and Zoo, a seedy operation in Thailand that PETA Asia sounded the alarm on previously. As pointed out by the Daily Mail, though, the exploit garnered quite a backlash.

Chimpanzees are a lot like us humans. They love slapstick humor, falling about if one of their chimpanzee pals falls off a rock (as long as they don’t seem hurt). What they surely don’t find funny, though, is being exploited for entertainment—and the criticism that the video received proves that many members of the public don’t think such a horrible stunt is amusing, either. “Who ARE those tourists who don’t seem to give a s**t about animal welfare?!” one Twitter user asked—an apt question, considering that if everyone refused to patronize Samutprakan Zoo and other animal-exploiting operations like it, it would be near impossible for such businesses to stay afloat.

In 2019, a PETA Asia video exposé of Samutprakan Zoo showed that elephants at the facility are stabbed in order to make them perform tricks, crocodiles are struck with bamboo poles, and tigers are harassed for performances and photos with tourists. Eyewitnesses found that other animals, including a young orangutan and a young chimpanzee (who could be this same one forced to ride a bike and spray disinfectant), appeared frustrated and listless.

Thanks to thousands of kind people who took action, Trip.com and Ctrip (Asia’s biggest travel agency) have made the compassionate decision to stop selling tickets to Samutprakan Zoo.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The United Nations famously protects cultural heritage sites, but for the first time it has recognized the unique culture of animals.

At the 13th Conference of Parties (CoP) to the United Nations Environment Program's (UNEP) Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), which took place recently in India, the conference attendees agreed to protect the ability of West African chimpanzees to crack nuts, according to Down to Earth magazine. The CMS recognized the unique learned ability of chimpanzees to use stone hammers and bits of wood to crack nuts, making this the first time, it seems, that one species has formally recognized the value of another's learned customs, according to The Times of London.

The proposal recognized that there are 39 cultural variations that are recognized in chimpanzees across various regions of Africa, but it said, ""[a]mong these, the clearest instance was nut-cracking, common in the West, yet absent elsewhere despite the availability of the necessary raw materials."" The CMS is looking to create something similar to a cultural heritage site, where chimpanzee nut-cracking is protected. The CMS said it highlights the chimpanzees' ""unique technological culture,"" as CNN reported. The ability to use stone and wood as a hammer and anvil is only observed in chimpanzees in West Africa. The CMS said that chimps in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and the Ivory Coast have the ability, but those in other parts of Africa do not, according to CNN.

""In different parts of western Africa, scientists noted that chimpanzees interacted with each other and used tools, so their behaviors are different from other animals. It becomes apparent when you watch them for a while,"" said Ian Redmond, a CMS tropical field biologist and conservationist, to Down to Earth. ""You can tell where a chimpanzee is from by looking at its behavior in a way similar to when you recognize which tribe a human comes from through her clothes, dancing and mannerisms."" The need to protect chimpanzees is particularly pronounced now that their habitat is rapidly changing due to the climate crisis and industrial nut farming. ""[We] must expect [nut cracking culture] to suffer a high degree of threat, a situation that is reminiscent of cultural extinctions among humans, such as of relatively rare local languages and other customs,"" the CMS wrote in its proposal.

@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;@TRAFFIC_WLTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Some of NIH’s chimpanzees will not retire to a sanctuary as planned

The U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) will not be retiring all of its chimpanzees to a sanctuary, as it originally pledged to do, agency head Francis Collins announced today. Nearly four dozen chimps at a biomedical primate facility in New Mexico will remain there because they are too old and sick to move, he said, although scientific studies of them have ended. Some federally owned or supported chimpanzees at other biomedical primate facilities may also not be retired to sanctuaries.

“Some of these animals are quite old and very frail. It was just going to be too unsafe to move all of them,” says NIH Deputy Director James Anderson, whose division oversees the NIH Chimpanzee Management Program. “We’re not going to take the risk.”

Chimp Haven in Keithville, Louisiana, the national chimpanzee sanctuary where the animals were supposed to be retired, laments the decision. “We’re disappointed,” says Stephen Ross, the sanctuary’s board chair. “We believe that every chimpanzee should have the opportunity to live out the rest of their life in a sanctuary, and we’re concerned this decision will set a precedent for other chimps still waiting to be retired.”

Biomedical research on chimpanzees effectively ended in 2015, when NIH announced it would no longer fund such studies. The agency also pledged to retire all of the approximately 300 chimps it owned or supported to Chimp Haven. Experts expected that the 340 or so other chimpanzees privately owned for research would follow suit. But retirement proceeded slowly. In the 2 years after NIH’s decision, only 51 government-owned or -supported chimps and 22 privately owned chimps had entered sanctuaries.

In 2017, NIH announced a formal retirement plan, with Anderson predicting most of its animals would enter a sanctuary within 10 years. And by the following year, retirement had picked up, with more chimps in sanctuaries than in biomedical facilities for the first time. Today, only 178 government-owned or -supported chimpanzees live in biomedical primate facilities: the Alamogordo Primate Facility in New Mexico; the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Bastrop, Texas; and the Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio. About 190 chimpanzees remain at two private facilities: the New Iberia Research Center in Louisiana, and Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta.

Many of these remaining chimps have lived at their facilities for decades, which means they’re nearing the end of their lives, and have diabetes, heart conditions, and other infirmities. Some in the biomedical community have argued that these animals are too sick and frail to survive the stresses of a long trip and a new living facility, with new humans and chimps to get used to. They point to nine older chimps that died within 2 years of being transferred from the MD Anderson Cancer Center to Chimp Haven about 5 years ago.

In 2018, NIH created a working group to help the agency figure out which chimpanzees were fit to move to a sanctuary. A panel of NIH veterinarians not involved with the agency’s Chimpanzee Management Program reviewed the health records of chimps at the Alamogordo facility and consulted the vets there. In a report completed in September, the vets recommended that all 44 remaining chimpanzees at Alamogordo remain there for the rest of their lives. “Many of the animals had varying degrees of cardiovascular disease, [and] these conditions could cause the animals to die in transport,” according to the report.

“The NIH’s decision is in the best interest of these elderly and frail animals,” writes Matthew Bailey, president of the Washington, D.C.–based National Association for Biomedical Research, in a statement released today. “The chimpanzees will live out their days in Alamogordo, where … they have forged close bonds with their social groups and their caretakers.”

But the Washington, D.C.–based Humane Society of the United States says NIH’s evaluation process was flawed. “The NIH panel didn’t include vets with sanctuary experience, and it just rubber stamped what the labs wanted,” says Kathleen Conlee, the organization’s vice president of animal research issues. She contends that the Alamogordo facility wants to keep the animals because they get NIH funding to care for them. (A spokesperson for the company that manages the facility directed all press queries to NIH.) “We are extremely disappointed that NIH has broken its promise to these chimpanzees,” Conlee says.

Ross says NIH shouldn’t just look at the potential drawbacks of moving the animals, but also at the upside. “There are tremendous benefits of getting them in the large, dynamic social groups we have at Chimp Haven,” he says, in which chimps “meet new friends and in most cases keep old friends, too.” He also says many (though not all) of the animals at Chimp Haven are free to climb trees and roam large, open-topped, grassy enclosures—something they can’t do at Alamogordo. “The benefits of sending these animals to a sanctuary far outweigh the risks.”

Anderson says NIH’s vets had the best interests of the animals in mind. And he contends that the chimps that will remain at Alamogordo will still live good lives, in their existing social groups and with access to the outdoors (see video above).

NIH will next turn its attention to the chimps at the MD Anderson Center. Fifty-nine animals of the animals there have already gone to Chimp Haven this year, Anderson says, but he’s not sure how many of the remaining 63 will make it. “It’s possible some will retire where they are.”

The Little Rock Zoo welcomed a new chimpanzee last month, officials announced Thursday.

Kianga is a 13-year-old female chimp who came to Little Rock from the Albuquerque Biological Park on a breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Chimpanzee Species Survival Plan. She arrived March 3.

According to her keepers, Kianga is petite but savvy and has already made friends with the other chimps, the zoo said in a news release.

Since Kianga’s arrival, the zoo has closed due to the covid-19 pandemic, but anyone interested in learning about her and the zoo’s other chimpanzees can watch a video posted on the zoo’s Facebook page on Sunday.

The zoo is also hosting daily virtual tours on Facebook. See the zoo's website for details.

Thirteen is considered adult age for female chimpanzees, a Little Rock Zoo employee said in the video, while males reach adult age around 15 or 16.

29-year-old chimpanzee Bunny gave birth to a female chimpanzee on July 5.

The Zoo’s animal staff said she had an uncomplicated labor and delivery, and Bunny and the baby have spent their first 10 days together bonding in a quiet, off-exhibit area.

“Bunny is very attentive and protective of her baby. She likes to hold the baby up and watch her move and often nuzzles her face,” said Erin Cantwell, mammal collection and conservation manager. “Bunny is also doing a great job of helping us by showing us the baby when her care team ask, which has allowed us to be able to observe her closely and make sure she looks good. The baby is nursing regularly and getting stronger every day.”

The Chimpanzee Forest team has been monitoring the pair closely to make sure all behaviors are normal between the infant and the mother because Bunny is mostly deaf- with slight hearing in one year.

Keepers said she is able to hear and feel the baby when it cries loudly.

“We want to be as hands-off as possible to allow mom and baby plenty of time to develop their relationship. Just like with human moms, there is a steep learning curve for both the baby and the mother in the first few days as they both adjust to this new way of life,” said Cantwell.

The little chimpanzee has little fluffy black hair covering most of her body and spends nearly all of her time cradled in Bunny’s arms or clinging closely to her back. Chimp babies usually weigh 2-3 pounds at birth.

“We are so excited to see Bunny flourish as a mom,” said Cantwell. “It’s great to watch an animal we care so much about experience this next step in her life. And, chimp babies are really quite adorable. We can’t wait to watch the baby grow up and achieve her own life milestones!”

Bunny is with a smaller group of chimps so she can focus on her baby and not have to worry about the social dynamics of chimp society, the Zoo said.

There are 13 chimpanzees in the Maryland Zoo’s troop including the newborn. The Zoo said for now, Bunny and her baby will stay behind the scenes so they can strengthen their bond and then later will be introduced to the troop.";It’s A Girl!

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Common chimpanzee behaviours, like stripping the leaves from a twig and using it to fish for termites, are becoming more rare according to new research that suggests that human activity is wearing down chimpanzee culture.

Culture, in the animal sense, being the diversity of behaviour and the sharing of knowledge between individuals.

A study published on Thursday in the journal Science revealed an 88 percent decline on average in the number of behaviours a chimpanzee will show when they’re living near areas with lots of people, or roads, or without forest cover.

Chimpanzees might be more cautious about cracking nuts loudly using stones, for example, for fear of attracting the attention of poachers. Similarly, declining chimpanzee numbers mean there are fewer individuals to show others how to, say, get water using moss.

“We weren’t surprised that the human impact was having a negative effect but we were surprised by the degree,” primate researcher Ammie Kalan told Motherboard over the phone.

The findings are frighteningly robust. Researchers catalogued 31 different behaviours (such as making cushions out of leaves or cooling down in a nearby cave) in 144 social groups. The study spanned the entire geographic range of wild chimpanzees, from Guinea in Western Africa to Southern Sudan in the east and Angola in the south.

No matter how the scientists grouped the behaviours in their statistical analysis, the results were the same: human impact isn’t just linked with population declines, it’s also affecting how chimpanzees behave.

“It wasn’t just based on a single glance at the dataset, but it was a really strong pattern,” Kalan said.

Chimpanzee numbers have declined by more than 80 percent in the past quarter century partly because of the fragmentation of their forest habitat through agriculture and climate change. This means there are fewer of them to pass on behaviours.

Behavioural diversity could also be decreasing, the authors note, because climate change is limiting the availability of foods or plants they smash up or use to hunt for ants.

The researchers aren’t sure whether chimps spontaneously developing new behaviours can make up for the loss in behavioural diversity. They fear some yet-unobserved behaviours may be gone before any human ever gets to witness them.

Chimpanzees aren’t the only animals that could suffer from culture loss thanks to anthropogenic activity and climate change. Kalan said that any animal that’s socially intelligent and spreads ideas between generations could be at risk: orangutans, whales, dolphins, elephants, even song birds with special dialects.

The latest United Nations Environment Programme report recognizes the importance of behavioural diversity and says data collection on social groups should be included in conservation efforts, along with keeping animal numbers and genetic variability up, going forward.

Kalan and the other study authors suggest creating “cultural heritage sites” to try and preserve chimpanzee behaviours. These would be specific locations that are particularly important to chimpanzees for tool use or communication—a cave or group of stones, for example.

“If those places didn’t exist then those behaviours most likely would not continue. It really becomes part of the cultural heritage of that chimpanzee community,” Kalan explained.

Coins produced in Cupro Nickel Diamond Finish and in color to bring the Primates to life

Low mintage of 7,500

Special magnetic collector’s album to hold all four coins will be available separately!

The Rock of Gibraltar is one of the Pillars of Hercules, the peninsulas that flank the entrance to the Strait of Gibraltar, a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Gibraltar from Morocco in Africa. At the narrowest point, Europe and Africa are only separated by 7.7 nautical miles of ocean.

The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) can be found in north-west and central Africa and is a species of great ape. This primate lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 individuals, although they split into much smaller groups to travel and forage during the day. The species lives in a male-dominated and strict hierarchy, which means that disputes can generally be settled without the need for violence.

Believed to be one of the closest living relatives of humans, nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded using tools, modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water.

The biggest threats to the common Chimpanzee are habitat destruction, poaching and disease. The species is listed on the International Union of Conservation of Nature Red List as an endangered species and are therefore legally protected in most of their range.

The coin, manufactured by the Pobjoy Mint, features an adult chimpanzee with an infant. With the coin available in stunning color, these enchanting primates are really brought to life and the coin will hopefully highlight the fact that we are losing some of our amazing primates and provoke some thought into saving this beautiful animals.

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"When and where did humans split from the apes to become a separate branch of bipeds? Are we an ape or not? If so, which of the living Great Apes is the closest to humans?

European philosophers and scientists have debated questions like these for more than three centuries.

From the pre-evolutionary musings of sixteenth century Dutch anatomists like Nicolaes Tulp and eighteenth century naturalists such as Carl Linnaeus, to the father of evolutionary biology, Charles Darwin, and his successors, Western scholars have long pondered where among the living primates humans belong.

The careful and detailed dissections of Great Apes and humans done by ‘Darwin’s bulldog’, T.H. Huxley, in the late nineteenth century seemed to reveal that gorillas and chimpanzees were physically more alike than either species was to humans.

This also squared with the view that humans were very distinct from the other African Apes, having evolved for longer, and perhaps at a faster rate, to obtain highly distinctive features like our upright posture, bipedal locomotion and big brains.

Still, Huxley’s work made it starkly clear that humans were a Great Ape, closer to our African kin than our East Asian ape cousins, the orangutan.

It was unclear, however, which of the hundreds of extinct ape species found during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Africa, Europe and Asia, dating from the period 10 million to 35 million years old, gave rise to the human lineage.

By the mid-1960s this seemed to be solved. David Pilbeam of Harvard University argued that Ramapithecus, a 14 million year old ape from the Siwalik Mountains of Pakistan, but also found in East Africa, was the earliest member of the human line.

It was even suggested that humans had split from a common ancestor with the African apes by about 30 million years ago, making our evolution a very long process indeed.

Coincidentally, at the time Ramapithecus was being touted as the first human ancestor, pioneers of the nascent field of molecular biology were beginning to compare blood proteins among different mammals, including humans and apes, to study their evolution.

Their findings were poised to cause a major upset among anthropologists, and would come to set the framework for understanding the origins of the human branch until today.

Emile Zuckerkandl and twice Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling were among the many workers studying haemoglobin, and were interested in differences between humans and the gorilla.

They found that the differences between the two species were mostly the result of ‘neutral’ mutations, or genetic changes with little or no consequence for the functioning of blood proteins themselves.

The neutrality of these mutations meant they could be used as a yardstick of evolutionary distance - the more mutations accumulated, the longer the time since the species split.

Neutral mutations were also found to occur with enough regularity to provide a kind of ‘molecular clock’; which is today used across the entire tree of life to give evolution a time frame.

Although the molecular clock is now a well established tool in evolutionary biology, it is not without its controversies or detractors.

It isn’t as accurate as the geological clocks used routinely to date rocks and fossils by geologists, although, they also have their uncertainties of course.

And, rather cleverly, modern molecular clocks use dated geological events as a kind of reference or standard against which to calibrate evolutionary time, especially the ‘tick rate’ (or mutation rate) of the clock itself.

With the advent of ancient DNA sequencing, we can even study clocks in extinct species and get a handle on whether its ticking rate has changed over time.

These first molecular clocks suggested humans and gorillas had separated only around 11 million years ago, not 30 million as suggested by fossils like Ramapithecus.

Surprisingly, this date is remarkably similar to even the most recent molecular clock estimates as well as the latest fossil discoveries, as we shall see later, indicating gorillas diverged between 8.5 and 12 million years ago.

Incidentally, once the bony face of Ramapithecus was unearthed from the fosil record of Pakistan in the early 1980s, the human status of this ape was quickly reassessed.

When it comes to studying Great Ape evolution, especially chimpanzees, we have so little to go on from the fossil record that we have no choice but reply heavily on genomic evidence.

As it turns out, everything we know about chimp evolution has been garnered from their genomes: the common chimpanzee (species: Pan troglodytes) had its genome sequenced in 2005, while the bonobo (species: Pan paniscus) only had its genetic code fully read in 2012.

So far, we’ve found just three fossil teeth for the entirety of chimpanzee evolution, and they’re a mere 500,000 years old.

As I noted earlier, Huxley’s dissections in the late 1800s established the closeness of humans to chimpanzees and gorillas.

But, for a good portion of the twentieth century, the precise branching arrangements of the African ape tree - whether humans were closest to either of the apes or sat out on our own - were contested.

It wasn’t until the year 2000 when this was finally resolved by molecular biologists: humans and chimpanzees were shown to share an ancestor after gorillas had gone their separate evolutionary way.

Following the sequencing of the complete human and chimpanzee genomes by 2005, geneticists showed that we share around 99 percent of our DNA, firming up our closeness.

In 2000, along came Orrorin tugenensis and Sahelanthropus tchadensis, fossils that appeared to belong to the human line, and dated between 6 and 7 million years old.

Most molecular clocks at the time, and many since, put the split between humans and chimpanzees at only around 5-6 million years ago.

But now the fossil record had pushed the date back, and so the molecular clocks would need to be rethought.

Some geneticists and anthropologists argued against Orrorin, Sahelanthropus and another group, Ardipithecus, being in the human branch on the grounds that they were too old and their similarities to humans explainable in ways other than shared ancestry.

While most anthropologists currently welcome them as pre-humans, there continue to be high profile sceptics, and opinions can change quickly with new evidence.

Still, truth is we have so few fossils in the window of 4 million to 12 million years ago that we’re a long way from having a clear sense of when and how gorillas, chimpanzees and humans split from each other, and the emergence of the human lineage itself.

The human fossil record gets a lot denser from about 4 million years onwards.

Enter Chororapithecus abyssinicus: found by anthropologists excavating in Ethiopia during 2006 and 2007.

This species seems to belong to the gorilla line, and new research published in the journal Nature by Shigehiro Katoh and a large international team has confirmed the age of the species to be 8 million years old.

Another fossil probably belonging to the gorilla branch is Nakalipithecus from Kenya, found also in 2007, but dated to about 10 million years old.

These fossils together constrain the age of the gorilla versus chimpanzee-human split to between 8 and 10 million years ago, well within the range of estimates from molecular clocks.

Big tick for the molecular clock.

What might this mean for Sahelanthropus, Orrorin and Ardipithecus regarding our understanding of the human lineage?

Well, if these groups are indeed early humans, then the human-chimp ancestor must have formed very quickly, and just as quickly split to begin the human line; all within 1 or 2 million years.

Alternatively, if the detractors are correct, and Sahelanthropus, Orrorin and Ardipithecus turn out not be human, then there’s a huge chunk of time, 4-6 million to be precise, for these events to occur, and an even bigger gap in knowledge of our past.

Perhaps the more remarkable thing about of all about this is just how similar the dates for Chororapithecus and Nakalipithecus are to the pioneering estimates of Zuckerkandl and Pauling, published way back in 1962 using their crude protein clock.

That’s a remarkable achievement in itself and testimony to the enduring role molecular clocks have played in evolutionary biology, as well as hinting at a few lessons we might just wish to take on board from history.";When humans split from the apes;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS93aGVuLWh1bWFucy1zcGxpdC1mcm9tLXRoZS1hcGVzLTU1MTA00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://images.theconversation.com/files/112265/original/image-20160222-25898-cixhdy.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop;02/22/2016;"[{'sent': 'If so, which of the living Great Apes is the closest to humans?\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Great Apes']}}, {'sent': 'From the pre-evolutionary musings of sixteenth century Dutch anatomists like Nicolaes Tulp and eighteenth century naturalists such as Carl Linnaeus, to the father of evolutionary biology, Charles Darwin, and his successors, Western scholars have long pondered where among the living primates humans belong.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Nicolaes Tulp', 'Carl Linnaeus', 'Charles Darwin']}}, {'sent': 'The careful and detailed dissections of Great Apes and humans done by ‘Darwin’s bulldog’, T.H.

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"MYRTLE BEACH, SC — The internet is still swooning over a video of a chimpanzee using a cellphone and scrolling through Instagram. The video of the chimpanzee at a Myrtle Beach safari company illustrates similarities between humans and chimpanzees, but some primatologists who study the behavior of our closest living relative and work to save them from extinction aren't loving it — at all.



Myrtle Beach Safari founder Bhagavan Antle posted the video of the juvenile chimpanzee Kody on his Facebook page and it's since been picked up on Twitter, Instagram and Reddit. Antle did not return Patch's attempts for comment, both through the website and by Facebook Messenger.

Chimpanzees are among the planet's most amazing animals, sharing 98 percent of genetic DNA with humans. They're a lot like us in many other ways, too.

Published research has shown chimpanzees lead rich, emotional lives and are capable of feeling emotions such as happiness and empathy. They use vocalizations to warn other chimpanzees in their troupes of approaching danger, and have a repertoire of 58 gestures to communicate with each other. One study found chimpanzees and human toddlers 12 to 24 months of age share behaviors such as jumping, hugging, stomping and throwing objects.

Given all that research has shown about chimpanzee behavior, it's not a stretch to suggest that the Myrtle Beach chimpanzee was making choices about the Instagram photos, primatologist Benjamin Beck, who has written several books about great ape behavior, told Patch.

""There is no scientific proof in the video but I would not be surprised if the chimp recognizes pictures and selects those he wants to look at,"" Beck said, emphasizing his comments were not intended as an endorsement of Myrtle Beach Safari or its operators.

""We know that chimpanzees do that with books, magazines, and tablets. They can recognize pictures of people, other animals, themselves, places, and foods, and they choose to watch some pictures more often and for longer durations, which indicates preferences,"" Beck said.

Noting that swiping — that is, a finger motion to move from one image to another on a social platform such as Instagram — ""is not a common chimpanzee movement,"" Beck said he was impressed by the chimpanzee's thumb mobility.

And while ""there is evidence that seeing video of chimpanzees doing 'human-like things' leads human viewers to think they might make good pets,"" Beck isn't too worried the video will spur widespread interest among U.S. citizens in obtaining a great ape as a pet. It's illegal to purchase chimpanzees and other great apes across state lines in the United States

""We should not rush to conclusions because we don't like the back story of pet chimpanzees and the commercial exploitation of apes in entertainment,"" Beck said.

But some primatologists, including the legendary Jane Goodall, cite the illegal pet trade as a key reason for their opposition to Antle's video and others like it on his Facebook page. Goodall called the video an ""awful portrayal"" of a chimpanzee in captivity and said it perpetuates both the illegal pet trade of great apes and the idea that they make ""cute pets.""

The danger of keeping a chimpanzee as a pet was glaringly demonstrated in 2009 when Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman, was viciously attacked by Travis, her friend's 200-pound pet chimpanzee. Nash received a face transplant after the chimp mangled her face, leaving her without a nose, eyes or lips. An infection spread by the ape left her permanently blind;



In her statement, Goodall said the interactions depicted in Antle's video are ""highly dangerous, as well as harmful to the well-being of the chimpanzee.""

""As responsible and compassionate individuals, I hope anyone who sees the video will not like, share or comment on it and all responsible media outlets change the coverage of the video to highlight stories of chimpanzees in the wild or responsible captive care,"" Goodall said in the statement. ""And I hope and urge the people who have chimpanzees in their care will cease use of him in this way and join those of us who are working to end the cruel treatment of chimpanzees in entertainment.""

Primatologist Ashley Edes, a postdoctoral fellow at the National Zoo, wrote in a tweet that ""research has shown that sharing images [and] videos like this fuels the exotic pet trade, which we never want to encourage.""

About 3,000 great apes are stolen every year to supply the illegal pet trade, but that number ""is only a fraction of the total number of apes captured for the live trade, as apes are prone to high mortality rates during the trafficking process,"" Orif Drori, founder of the Last Great Ape Organization, wrote for a report by the United Nations' Great Ape Survival Project.

The international criminal network supplies a range of markets, including the entertainment industry, disreputable zoos and wealthy people who want exotic pets as status symbols, the report said.

In her tweet, Edes wrote that ""animals in the pet trade experience horrific conditions [and] struggle when they're eventually surrendered.""

Perhaps no organization knows that better than the Center for Great Apes in Florida, where most of the chimpanzee and orangutan residents were rescued from either the entertainment industry or inappropriate living conditions such as basements, garages, tiny indoor cages and backyard cages.

""Exotic pet rescue situations are among our saddest 'before' stories because of the unnatural living conditions the apes endure,"" Center for Great Apes explained on its website, citing as examples Kiki and Linus, two orangutans that lived for years without exposure to sunlight were barely able to walk when they arrived at the center, let alone move from tree to tree, as they would in the wild.

Many of the chimpanzees and orangutans arrive with profound psychological damage and it takes years to properly rehabilitate them, according to the Center for Great Apes.

Beck said the Myrtle Beach Safari video may well ""raise appreciation for the sentience of apes, and make people more responsive to conservation efforts.""

All four types of great apes are imperiled in their range countries. Although the most prevalent of all types of great apes, chimpanzees are endangered, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"The question of where we humans come from is one many people ask, and the answer is getting more complicated as new evidence is emerging all the time.

For most of recorded history humankind has been placed on a metaphorical, and sometimes literal, pedestal. Sure, modern humans were flesh and blood like other animals.

But they were regarded as being so special that in the Linnaean taxonomy that prevailed well into the second half of the 20th century they were given their own family, the Hominidae.

Read more: Ancient DNA sheds light on the origin of Europeans

This distinguished them from the Pongidae, the separate family used for the three African great apes – the common chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla – plus the orangutan from Southeast Asia.

We now realise that modern humans are just one of the African great apes.

So when and how did this radically changed perception come about?

Early observations

In the 19th century the only evidence available for determining the closeness of the relationship between any two living animals was how similar they were in terms of what the naked eye could tell from their bones, teeth, muscles and organs.

The first person to undertake a systematic comparative review of these differences between modern humans and the apes was English biologist Thomas Henry Huxley.

In the central section of a small book he published in 1863, called Evidence as to Man’s Place in Nature, Huxley concluded that the differences between modern humans and African apes were less than those between African apes and orangutans.

This was the evidence the English naturalist Charles Darwin referred to in The Descent of Man in 1871.

He speculated that because African apes were morphologically closer to modern humans than the apes from Asia, then the ancestors of modern humans were more likely to be found in Africa than elsewhere.

A closer inspection

Developments in biochemistry and immunology during the first half of the 20th century enabled the search for evidence of the relationships between modern humans and the apes to shift from macroscopic morphology to the morphology of molecules.

The results of applying a new generation of analytical methods to proteins were reported by the Austrian-born French biologist Emile Zuckerkandl and American biologist Morris Goodman in the early 1960s.

Zuckerkandl used enzymes to break up the protein component of haemoglobin into its peptide components. He showed that the patterns of the peptides from modern humans, gorilla and chimpanzee were indistinguishable.

Goodman used a different method, immunodiffusion, to study albumin, a serum protein. He showed that the patterns produced by the albumins of modern humans and the chimpanzee were identical. He concluded that this was because the albumin molecules were, to all intents and purposes, identical.

Apes and humans: related

Proteins are made up of a string of amino acids and in many instances one amino acid can be substituted for another without changing the function of the protein.

In the late 1960s, the American anthropologist Vince Sarich and New Zealand biologist Allan Wilson exploited these minor differences in protein structure and concluded that modern humans and the African apes were very closely related.

They also provided the first molecular clock estimate of modern human-African ape divergence, dating the split to only around five million years ago. This date was less than half of contemporary estimates based on fossil evidence.

In 1975 the American human geneticist Mary-Claire King and Allan Wilson showed that 99% of the amino-acid sequences of chimpanzee and modern human blood proteins were identical.

Enter DNA

The discovery by James Watson and Francis Crick, with unwitting help from Rosalind Franklin, of the basic structure of DNA, and the subsequent discovery by Crick and others of the nature of the genetic code, meant that the relationships among organisms could be pursued at the level of the genome.

Nowadays technological advances mean that whole genomes can be sequenced. Over the past decade researchers have published good draft sequences of the nuclear genomes of the chimpanzee, orangutan, gorilla and the bonobo.

More and better data are steadily being accumulated, and in 2013 a review of ape DNA based on the genomes of 79 great apes was published.

These new ape genome sequences support the results of earlier analyses of both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA that suggested modern humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either is to the gorilla.

When DNA differences among modern humans and the great apes are calibrated using the best palaeontological evidence for the split between the apes and the old world monkeys, those differences predict that the hypothetical common ancestor of modern humans, chimpanzees and bonobos lived about 8 million years ago.

The rise of the hominins

Most researchers now recognise the modern human as hominins.

Still, the question “where do we come from” can from a scientific perspective be difficult for someone outside of the discipline to come to grips with. In part this is because the fossil record for human evolution seems to grow exponentially, with the author of each new discovery often claiming that the textbooks need to be rewritten.

The interdisciplinary nature of palaeoanthropology also means that new evidence that helps us make sense of our ancestry does not always come in the form of new fossils.

It comes from advances in a range of disciplines that include archaeology, comparative anatomy, earth sciences, evolutionary biology, genomics and primatology.

A further complicating factor is that the human fossil record does not just consist of the fossil evidence of our direct ancestors.

Many of the fossils belong to lineages that do not make it to the surface of the Tree of Life. They belong to extinct close relatives, and the task of sorting close relatives from ancestors is one with which we are only just now beginning to grapple.

There is a lineage that leads to today’s Homo sapiens, but there are also a host of side experiments that are equally important to understand. They represent some of the most interesting chapters in human evolution.

Origins of the genus Homo

Understanding the origins of our own genus Homo means establishing what fossils we recognise as being the first early humans.

Sometime before 4 million years ago we see the first evidence of the genus Australopithecus. These fossils sample the kind of creature that was most likely the ancestor to the genus Homo.

Around 2.5 million years ago we see the first fossil evidence of species in Africa that many argue belong to our own lineage. One of these, Homo habilis, almost certainly made stone tools, had a slightly larger brain than Australopithecus, stood upright and regularly walked on two legs.

Some recognise a second species, Homo rudolfensis, about which we know even less.

These possible human ancestors lived alongside close relatives that were almost certainly not our ancestors. These species are called Paranthropus or robust australopiths – they had small brains, big jaw bones, large flat faces, and huge chewing teeth.

They lasted for at least a million years, so whatever they were eating (which is still a mystery) they were successful in the sense that they lasted as long in the fossil record as the average mammal.

But some researchers think that Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis are not different enough from the australopiths that preceded them to justify being included in the genus Homo.

They claim that the size and shape of their body and the size of their teeth and jaws was little different from that of the australopiths. This means that their locomotion and diet had not shifted far enough in the direction of pre-modern Homo species such as Homo erectus to justify inclusion in Homo.

Tool making is not enough

Also, because it is becoming evident that australopiths may have been making tools earlier than Homo habilis it means that tool-making can no longer be seen as the sole prerogative of Homo.

There is a developing consensus that the relaxation of the criteria more than 50 years ago that saw the inclusion of Homo habilis into the genus Homo needs to be reconsidered.

Species that emerge slightly later from Africa, such as Homo ergaster, fit much more clearly within what we understand by the genus Homo. That species probably left Africa around 2 million years ago and migrated ultimately as far east as China and Indonesia where it evolved, eventually, into Homo erectus.

A number of further migrations out of Africa probably occurred after the initial Homo ergaster migration, one of which, Homo heidelbergensis, is considered by many palaeoanthropologists to be the ancestor of both Neanderthals (Homo neanderthalensis) and modern humans (Homo sapiens).

As far as we know, Neanderthals evolved outside of Africa, perhaps in response to the ice ages of Europe. Our ancestors remained in Africa where perhaps as early as 300,000 years ago, as revealed from recent redating of the Moroccan site of Jebel Irhoud, were well along in the process of evolving into modern humans.

So the origins of ‘us’

Once we get to the origins of our own species Homo sapiens we have the added advantage that we are able to now use next generation sequencing methods to recover ancient DNA (aDNA).

As geneticists recover ancient genomes from different extinct hominin species, they are generating insights that are not possible from comparing the anatomy of the fossils alone.

There is now fossil evidence from teeth to suggest that Homo sapiens may have been in China by 120,000 years ago and in South East Asia by 67,000 years.

The discovery of some distinctive modern human DNA within the DNA recovered from a Neanderthal fossil suggests that modest interbreeding was occurring between Neanderthals and modern humans in Central Asia by 100,000 years ago.

Modern humans have not shared the planet with another hominin species for several tens of thousands of years. But before that, in the past 300,000 years or so, there is fossil and DNA evidence of several hominin species, including the recently reported archaic hominin Homo naledi

First and foremost there was Homo neanderthalensis, whose range overlapped with modern humans in the Near East. Neanderthals most likely became extinct as a result of direct competition with the more technologically sophisticated Homo sapiens.

The evidence from DNA shows that there was interbreeding between our species and pre-modern humans, including the Neanderthals and the other enigmatic hominin referred to as the Denisovans.

We do not yet know how and when Homo erectus became extinct. It would appear that another unexpected side experiment in hominin evolution, known from the island of Flores and called Homo floresiensis most likely became extinct sometime after 60,000 years ago.

Indeed this hominin may represent something far more significant than simply an interesting side experiment, with many leading palaeoanthropologists arguing that the Hobbit may represent a pre-ergaster migration out of Africa.

What next?

Even though thousands of hominin fossils have now been recovered and described there is still much work to be done.

Was there a hominin that successfully migrated out of Africa prior to Homo ergaster? Did most of human evolution occur in Africa? Did some important transitions occur outside of Africa?

When did Homo erectus become extinct, and was there genetic exchange between erectus, sapiens and perhaps other hominin species?

As is often the case in science, with the recovery of additional data, in this case fossils and DNA extracted from fossils, we generate more questions than answers.

But ultimately all of this new evidence will result in a far more sophisticated appreciation of not only our evolution, but also the evolution of our extinct fossil cousins.";The origin of ‘us’: what

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Her hunger growing, she broke a short branch from a tree, ripped off the side-shoots and leaves, stripped down the bark, and sharpened the end with her teeth. Jabbing this self-made spear into a tree hollow, she struck lucky first time and dragged a screeching bushbaby from its sleeping space. With a few swift blows this chimpanzee had achieved her aim: dinner.

It’s nearly 15 years since scientists first observed western chimpanzees – a critically endangered subspecies of the common chimpanzee – hunting with spears at a site in south-eastern Senegal. Native to western Africa, western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) are the only chimps known to use spears. They also differentiate themselves by living in caves, sharing food and travelling and foraging at night.

Despite this chimp subspecies being well studied, the data tend to be specific to particular localities. With no central database of findings, it was hard for scientists to compare studies, observe population trends or map out the density distribution of the animals. And these are the kinds of data that conservationists need to make evidence-based decisions on how best to protect the ape and where to prioritize conservation activities.

To remedy this issue, in 2005 scientists established the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission Ape Populations, Environments and Surveys database, or APES, to bring together survey data for all 14 taxa of great apes. Fourteen years later, they are able to show the benefits achieved by sharing data this way, and to demonstrate that similar databases would bring huge conservation benefits to other endangered species.

For western chimpanzees, APES collated 52 datasets collected during separate studies between 2001 and 2015 across nine different countries in West Africa.

“For the first time we were able to model the distribution of western chimpanzee densities across their entire range,” says Stefanie Heinicke from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany.

By comparing the chimp data with information on forest loss, the researchers could see that western chimpanzees are highly sensitive to forest loss, and that if a forest shrinks by more than 10% the chimps tend to disappear.

The database has already had an impact, demonstrating that western chimp numbers have declined by 80% since 1990 and providing the necessary evidence for the species to be updated to “critically endangered” on the IUCN’s Red List.

In their most recent publication, in Environmental Research Letters (ERL), Heinicke and colleagues reveal that only 17% of western chimps live in national parks, and 10% of western chimps live within 25 km of four multinational “development corridors” currently planned for West Africa.

“The results from our study can be used to estimate how many chimpanzees would likely be affected by such developments and advise on the locations where population connectivity might already be low and should therefore be avoided by new developments,” says Heinicke.

As well as improving our understanding of western chimps, this database has allowed researchers to get a handle on the distribution of bonobos, central chimpanzees and the western lowland gorilla, providing valuable input to the conservation action plans for these species.

A handful of similar taxon-specific databases are in existence for other taxa, but the researchers argue that rolling out these collaborative databases more widely would have huge conservation value.

“These databases help to fill the gaps in biodiversity data and they provide the level of detail needed for conservation planning,” says Heinicke.

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Scientists have learned that chimpanzees will ‘talk’ to each other using hand gestures with similar language rules to humans.

The primates will use language that, ahem, apes the way humans communicate with each other have learned.

Experts made this discovery after studying videos of wild chimps living in Uganda’s Budongo Forest Reserve. Like other great apes, chimpanzees lack the ability to speak but they use meaningful gestures, much like deaf people signing to each other.

The study found that chimp gestures are underpinned by mathematical patterns, or linguistic laws, similar to those seen in human language.

The team from the University of Roehampton focused on two particular rules known to apply across the board of human languages.

One was Zipf’s law of abbreviation, which predicts that more commonly used words tend to be shorter.

The other was Menzerath’s law, which predicts that larger linguistic structures are made up of shorter parts.

In the case of spoken language, this translates to longer words consisting of shorter syllables.

The scientists analysed more than 2,000 of around 58 different types of ‘play’ gesture employed by the Budongo Forest chimps.

They found that, as predicted by the two linguistic laws, more frequently used gestures were shorter in duration, and longer signing sequences were made up of shorter gesture ‘syllables’.

Lead researcher Raphaela Heesen said: ‘Primate gestural communication is, of course, very different to human language, but our results show that these two systems are underpinned by the same mathematical principles.’

‘We hope that our work will pave the way for similar studies, to see quite how widespread these laws might be across the animal kingdom.’

As well as using hand and foot gestures, chimps communicate with noises, body postures and facial expressions.

Research published in September last year showed that chimps and human toddlers employ similar stamping, pointing, and clapping tactics to get attention.

@IlWildTrade;@IlWildTrade;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Memories of 11 lions that were poisoned in Hamukungu village, bordering Queen Elizabeth National Park are still fresh in Derrick Ajuna's mind. One afternoon, in April 2018, he was drawn to a scene with carcasses scattered about. Ajuna, head guide of Kasoga Community Experience in the same area, believes that many people within the community, have not appreciated the value of wildlife.

""Even after the incident, animals continue to destroy crops and feed on domestic animals. The community argues that if they benefitted from wild animals, there would not be any problem,"" he reveals.

Expectations

With the new Uganda Wildlife Act 2019, tourism stakeholders and conservationists are elated that stringent laws have been considered to protect wildlife and increase sustainability. President Museveni assented to The Wildlife Act on July 1, 2019.

The new law replaces the old Uganda Wildlife Act 1996, which conservationists say, was not deterrent enough. ""The previous law was weak. That is why we worked on a tougher one. From seven years to life imprisonment. We have the toughest wildlife conservation law in the wild,"" declares Dr Barirega Akankwasa, commissioner of Wildlife Conservation at the Ministry of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities.

Stringent penalties

The highest penalty in the new Act is a maximum fine of Shs20 billion or life imprisonment, or both for an offence related to a wildlife species classified as extinct in the wild, critically endangered. These include the roan antelope, lion, hunting dog, spotted and stripped hyena, greater and lesser kudu, Ssese Island Sitatunga, Cheetah, African elephant, Delany's mouse, and endangered species such as impala, Rwenzori duiker, Rothschild's giraffe, mountain gorilla and the common chimpanzee.

A person who, without a permit takes, hunts, molests or reduces into possession protected specimen or is found with, sells, buys, transfers or accepts transfer of protected specimen, commits an offence and shall on conviction, be liable to a maximum fine of Shs200 million or to a jail term or both.

The Act also gives court powers to fine a first-time offender, Shs7 million or to a term of imprisonment, not exceeding 10 years, or both. Second time or subsequent offenders are required to pay a fine of Shs10 million or serve a maximum jail term of 20 years, or both.

The punishment for use of weapons, traps, explosives is Shs100 million fine or 10 years imprisonment, or both. This also applies to persons who unlawfully prepare land for cultivation, mining or those who take, destroy, damage or deface any object of geomorphological, archaeological, historical, cultural or scientific value.

Human-wildlife conflicts

UWA reports from 2009 to 2017, reveal more than 13,000 human wildlife conflicts, involving livestock predation by lions and leopards, elephant crop damage as well as hippo, buffalo and chimpanzee attacks. Between 1996 and 2009, 300 crocodile attacks were recorded. Among these, 247 deaths and 63 survival cases were recorded. Stray animals have turned areas around Queen Elizabeth, Murchison Falls Conservation Area and Kidepo Valley National Park into conflict hotspots. Since 2009, the number of human-wildlife conflict has risen by more than 22 per cent.

Compensation

The new law provides for compensation for loss occasioned by animals escaping from wildlife protected areas. Communities near protected areas have for long cast blame on Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) for delayed response when animals cross to community farmlands and feed on both their crops and domestic animals.

According to the Act, compensation will be given to a person who suffers body injury or is killed or suffers damage of his or her property by wild animals. This will be effected when the person's legal representative submits a claim to the wildlife compensation verification committee. The committee shall verify a claim and submit it to the board together with its recommendation. The board will then review the claim and if approved, compensate victims according to the market rates.

Highlighted concerns

However, some stakeholders have expressed concern about compensatable animal list . ""I am concerned about the implementation. It is going to be difficult to value the damage. Even with the presence of the verification committee, I do not know how transparent the process is going to be. Many species of animals were left out of this arrangement. For example, among the primates, they considered baboons, mountain gorillas, and chimpanzees. Vervet monkeys which raid our crops are left out. Some communities have been reported to grow crops along gazetted conservation areas with the intention of getting compensated, when animals raid their gardens. All those issues need to be addressed,"" says John Tinka, founder of Kibale Association for Rural and Environmental Development (KAFRED) based in Kamwenge District.

Compensatable wildlife

According to the Act, section 84(1)(b), the compensatable wildlife species that cause damage to property are elephant, buffalo, lion, leopard, hippo, baboon, gorilla, chimpanzee and bushpig. The compensatable wildlife species that cause death and injury are elephant, lion, leopard, crocodile, buffalo, hyena, hippo, gorilla and chimpanzee.

Wildlife funds

The new law has reforms on the revenue sharing programme. The board shall authorise the executive director of UWA to pay 20 per cent of the park entry fees, collected from a wildlife protected area, to the local government of the area surrounding the wildlife protected zone from which the fees were collected, as a conditional grant.

Akankwasa, a member of the UWA board of trustees, says there is no longer room for diversion of funds. ""Previously, money was sent to local government, as their revenue and they could use it for allowances or spend it any way, they deemed fit. Now funds will go as conditional grants for specific community projects, such as building a classroom block"", he explains.

Dr Caroline Asiimwe, a veterinarian and conservation coordinator at Budongo Conservation Field Station (BCFS) wishes the fund was availed to communities near forest reserves. ""Much as 20 per cent is given to communities around protected areas which are national parks, consideration should be made for those living around forest reserves, where there is also wildlife and the communities are suffering the damages from animals such as baboons,"" she says.

Commercial agreement

The new law favours commercialisation of wildlife on private land through sustainable utilisation. The executive director of UWA may, with the approval of the board, enter into any suitable commercial or collaborative arrangement with any person for: the management of a conservation area or a portion, provision of services and infrastructure in a conservation area or the management of a species or a class of species of animals or plants.

Makerere University don and wildlife researcher Dr Amos Ochieng argues that collaborative commercial arrangements to manage conservation areas is a well thought out idea, adding that, ""Wildlife management should be treated as a land use activity to offer opportunities for economic and social benefits. Wildlife is found on both protected and private land. Collaboration with private land owners to manage conservation areas will offer more chances of wildlife survival outside protected areas.""

Reactions

The new Wildlife Act 2019 has generated mixed reactions among tourism and conservation stakeholders. Gillian Josephine, a tour operator based in northern Uganda, applauds the idea of giving 20 per cent to communities as conditional grants.

""That is good for conservation initiatives in the communities, since those community projects will have direct tangible effects to them. They will 'own conservation' as opposed to the 'I do not care' about wildlife attitude. The act will also lead to reduction in the wildlife-human conflicts because there is now compensation for problems which animals cause to communities. My people of Nwoya and those around Karenga, Orom can now take up conservation programmes seriously,"" she says.

Honest and fair committee

Tinka, whose association manages Bigodi Sanctuary, is concerned about the composition of the Community Wildlife Committee (CWC). He hopes the CWC will be fair and honest because it is composed of many government officials and only a handful of community members.

""For the case of Kibaale, we have someone from Kamwenge District Local Government, Kyenjojo, Kabarole, Bunyangabu, Kasese, one from a non-governmental organisation (NGO) and Community Development Officer (CDO). But from the wildlife interpretation, a community means people who come from parishes that make the park's boundary. I am hoping that they will invite representatives from these parishes to form part of the committee,"" he argues.

Composition of the committee

Every wildlife conservation area will have a community wildlife committee which will act as a link between UWA and the local community. The composition of the CWC is a representative of UWA, who shall be the secretary of the committee, a representative of each of the district local government surrounding the conservation area, a wildlife conservation NGO operating around the conservation area and a representative of a community wildlife association, operating within the wildlife conservation area. The members of the CWC shall be appointed by the minister of Tourism, Wildlife and Antiquities, in consultation with the UWA board. By definition in the Act, a community is an assemblage of human beings, living in a defined geographical area and identified by a common history, a common culture or a common residence in that area.

With a solid wildlife law, Uganda can fight against wildlife criminals who have had little fear of the paltry fines and prison sentences in the past.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Freud, Wilkie and the other chimpanzees peacefully fed and rested in the sun-dappled Tanzanian forest. Mzee Hilali stood next to me, writing notes on the chimpanzees’ behavior, as he had been doing for over 30 years as a field assistant for Jane Goodall’s long-term study at Gombe National Park.

Suddenly, a strange, high-pitched call sounded from where some other chimpanzees were feeding, about a hundred meters from us. Hilali turned to me, and with a little laugh, said, “Nyoka.” This was the Swahili word for “snake.”

Freud climbed down from his tree and walked quickly toward where the call had sounded, with Hilali following close behind. As I slowly made my way through the undergrowth to catch up with them, Hilali called to me: “Chatu!” “Python!”

When I caught up with Hilali, he was pointing to a tangled mass of leaves and vines on the forest floor. I looked closely – most of the snake lay hidden from view, but the one visible stretch of black and tan scaly hide was too big to be anything but a python.

From years of experience, Mzee Hilali knew instantly that this particular chimp call meant they’d found a snake. Does this mean that chimpanzees have a “word” for snake? Do chimpanzees have a language of their own? I’ve been working with a team of students and Tanzanian field assistants to record and analyze chimpanzee vocalizations in an effort to answer questions like this. Ultimately we hope to learn more about how human language first evolved.

Clues to the origins of language

Chimpanzees are among human beings’ closest living relatives, and they share with us many unusual traits. Like humans, chimps make and use tools; join together in groups to hunt animals like monkeys; defend group territories; and sometimes gang up on and kill their enemies.

One trait that seems to set humans apart from every other species, however, is a fully developed language. Other animals communicate, but only humans appear able to talk about an unlimited variety of topics. Language enables us to make plans, negotiate with and teach one another.

How and why language evolved remains a mystery. Much of the evidence of human evolution comes from fossils, but fossil bones don’t tell us much about soft tissues or the sounds early human ancestors made. Studying the communication patterns of our living relatives can help solve the mystery.

If some features of chimpanzee communication resemble language, we can study chimpanzees further to find clues for why those features evolved. If chimpanzee communication doesn’t share much in common with human language, then the key steps in language evolution must have occurred after our lineages separated (around 7.9 million years ago) for reasons unique to our human lineage.

Recording in the forest

To investigate chimp communication, my colleagues and I follow chimpanzees through the forest as they go about their lives. We carry a hand-held “shotgun” microphone and a digital recorder, waiting for them to call.

Usually we pick a particular chimp to follow each day, trying to get equal numbers of calls per individual. In addition to recording new calls, we’ve been working to build an archive of recordings from other researchers, going back to the 1970s. The archive currently contains over 71 hours of recordings.

Snake alarm calls are intriguing, but because chimps don’t encounter large snakes very often, it is hard to do a systematic study of them. (Cathy Crockford and colleagues have done some interesting experiments, though, playing back recordings of these calls to see how chimpanzees respond and presenting them with model snakes). One thing chimpanzees do every single day, though, is eat. Chimpanzees spend most of their time looking for food and eating it. And when they find food, they often give a particular kind of call: the rough-grunt.

A chimpanzee rough-grunt.

Biologist Lisa O'Bryan studied rough-grunt calls for her dissertation research with me. They vary from low, noisy grunts to higher-pitched calls. Some researchers have proposed an intriguing possibility: Maybe chimpanzees make distinct kinds of rough-grunt calls in response to particular foods, rather like words that name certain food items.

But Lisa has found that when eating any one kind of food, chimpanzees can produce a range of different rough-grunts. Rough-grunts thus tell other chimps that the caller is eating, but they don’t say what’s for dinner.

Just as a particular alarm call informs others that a snake has been found, the thin, wavering tones of a copulation scream announce that a mating has just taken place.

Author provided 14.6 KB (download) A chimpanzee copulation scream.

Why female chimpanzees sometimes give such a scream just as they finish mating remains unknown. Because the data collected by Mzee Hilali and other field assistants since the 1970s have been entered into a computer database, we can readily examine thousands of different mating events.

My student Tony Massaro has been analyzing these data to try to tease out what factors make females more likely to produce these calls. Such calls aren’t particularly word-like, but they do play an important role in communication. Like many wordless sounds that people make – think laughter, screams and crying – listeners hearing the sounds can infer quite a bit about the caller’s situation.

When Jane Goodall gives public talks, she often begins by giving a pant-hoot: a loud call that begins with an introduction, followed by a build-up, a climax and a let-down. Pant-hoots are loud and enable chimpanzees to communicate over long distances through the forest.

Previous studies have found differences in the pant-hoots calls from different regions. For example, the pant-hoots from Gombe sound a bit different from those made by chimpanzees in Mahale, 160 km away. When I played recordings of a single Mahale pant-hoot call to chimpanzees in Kibale Forest, Uganda, the Kibale chimpanzees acted as if they had just heard an intruder. If they were in a group with three or more males, they gave a loud vocal response and rapidly moved towards the speaker.

If they were in a group with only one or two males present, though, they stayed quiet, and if they approached, did so slowly and cautiously.

For chimpanzees, correctly telling friend from foe is a matter of life or death, so it would make sense for chimpanzees in neighboring groups to have distinctive pant-hoot calls.

Cathy Crockford and colleagues found that pant-hoots from different communities within Taï Forest, Côte d'Ivoire, also sound distinct. If such group-level differences result from vocal learning, they would be rather like dialects in human languages.

My student Nisarg Desai has been testing whether this is also the case at Gombe. We’ve been working with a team of Tanzanian field assistants, Hashimu Issa Salala and Nasibu Zuberi Madumbi, to record calls from the Mitumba and Kasekela chimpanzees, and are starting to test for differences between groups.

We are in the early stages of this analysis.

From calls to language isn’t a clear path

Chimpanzees might be capable of some degree of vocal learning, but I’m struck by how subtle the differences in pant-hoot calls are from place to place. Chimpanzees make lots of different calls – pant-hoots, pant-barks, waa-barks, pant-grunts, rough-grunts, and so on – but across Africa, all chimpanzees produce a pretty similar set of calls in similar circumstances. In this respect, chimpanzee calls resemble human sounds like laughter and crying more than they resemble human words, which can vary drastically from place to place.

Chimpanzees communicate effectively with their various sounds, but in ways quite similar to those of other nonhuman primates. This suggests that our common ancestor with chimpanzees also had a fairly typical repertoire of vocal communication for a nonhuman primate. The really big changes in human language – such as a lifelong ability to learn to make entirely new sounds and a rich symbolic meaning of such sounds – likely evolved later, for reasons that we still don’t understand.";Studying chimpanzee calls for clues about the origins of human

Festus, Mo. – The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri has just granted PETA’s motion for summary judgment against Andrew Sawyer, who boarded a chimpanzee named Joey in solitary confinement at the Missouri Primate Foundation from 2013 to 2016, when PETA sent a required notice of intent to sue under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)—and Sawyer absconded with Joey to an undisclosed location.

The district court has now ruled that Sawyer violated the ESA by failing to meet Joey’s fundamental social, physical, and psychological needs; terminated his ownership of the chimpanzee; and ordered counsel for PETA and Sawyer to agree on an acceptable accredited sanctuary where Joey can live for the rest of his life.

“After years of isolation in substandard conditions at the Missouri Primate Foundation, Joey finally has a future,” says PETA Foundation Deputy General Counsel for Animal Law Jared Goodman. “At a proper sanctuary, he’ll have space to roam, expert care, and the opportunity to interact with other members of his highly social species.”

PETA—whose motto reads, in part, that “animals are not ours to use for entertainment or abuse in any other way”—opposes speciesism, which is a human-supremacist worldview.

A captive chimpanzee has reunited with her carer who raised it as an infant 40 years ago.

Jessie, a 41-year-old female chimpanzee, recognised the elderly woman when she showed up in front of her enclosure at Wellington Zoo in the capital city of the same name in New Zealand.

Heartwarming footage captured Jessie and her carer's first encounter four decades later.

The carer, whose name has not been revealed, is seen trying to get Jessie’s attention.

Jessie, the matriarch of the zoo's population, appears to recognise the woman and the chimpanzee outstretches her hand for her to ""touch"" through the glass separating them.

Meanwhile, a woman in the background is heard saying “aww” as the pair reconnect.

The zoo posted the clip on its Facebook page and accompanies with a message that read: ""Watch this touching moment between Jessie, our 41-year-old female Chimpanzee and a volunteer that knew her when she was a baby.

""We're not crying, you're crying!""

A spokesperson for Wellington Zoo said: ""Jessie came over pretty quickly and it seemed like she knew her.""

According to reports, Jessie, who turns 42 in July, is Wellington Zoo’s oldest chimpanzee.

Chimpanzees are around six times stronger than humans and are highly intelligent animals, the zoo introduced.

They are able to learn sign language, recognise themselves in the mirror, and can make and use tools.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"West Africa’s chimpanzee population has dropped dramatically since the 1960s, falling from an estimated 1 million to fewer than 300,000 today.

Across West Africa, a network of sanctuaries is working to provide shelter for chimpanzees rescued from traffickers.

Members of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance say their work goes beyond simply caring for individual apes, extending to protecting wild chimpanzee populations and supporting the people who share their habitats.

In the 1960s, there were an estimated 1 million wild chimpanzees in West Africa. Today, there are fewer than 300,000. With habitat loss, hunting and wildlife trafficking taking their toll, chimps have now disappeared completely from four countries in the region. That makes the western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) the only one of the four chimp subspecies to be declared critically endangered.

At the forefront of the battle to save the western chimpanzee is a network of sanctuaries. These safe havens can have a dramatic effect on the countries where they are established, caring for individual animals while also working to help stabilize populations, tighten laws, and stop the illegal trade in wildlife from flourishing.

Twenty-three organizations operate as part of the Pan African Sanctuary Alliance (PASA), which was established in 2000 and now looks after 915 chimps in 13 countries. Many arrive as the result of habitat destruction, as forests are cleared for agriculture, logging and extractive industries, as well as infrastructure developments, decimating family groups and leaving young chimps abandoned.

Others will have suffered at the hands of hunters, victims of a lucrative trade that sees adults shot for bushmeat and juveniles sold on the black market to end up as pets or as entertainment in hotels, circuses and zoos in Africa and beyond.

Underpinning anti-trafficking efforts

While conservationists largely support the work of sanctuaries, there have been criticisms that they use funds that could be better used to protect wild populations, that their methods lack scientific rigor, and that they focus too much on individual animals rather looking at the bigger conservation picture.

What sanctuaries offer, says PASA executive director Greg Tully, is somewhere for the authorities to put confiscated chimps. Where they don’t exist, trafficking is rife, the authorities turn a blind eye, and the country often becomes a hub for the illegal trade.

“In countries that don’t have sanctuaries, wildlife law enforcement is a lot weaker,” Tully says. “Police and other law enforcement agencies don’t want to arrest someone who has a live chimpanzee if there’s nowhere to put it — they don’t want to be taking care of a baby chimp for the next 50 years.”

In recent years, Côte d’Ivoire has become a center for animal trafficking, as efforts to create a national chimp sanctuary have stalled.

“The destruction of the environment is at a level that is unseen anywhere else in Africa,” says Estelle Raballand, who has worked in West Africa for the last 25 years, the last three spearheading the push to create the Akatia sanctuary near the Ivorian capital, Abidjan.

Around 80% of the country’s forests were lost between 1960 and 2010. The government “has refused to have a sanctuary for many, many years and now they have lost almost all their forest and they’ve lost almost all their chimps,” Raballand says. “They have no management whatsoever of the wildlife trade.”

The few chimps that are confiscated are sent to the local zoo, which have neither the capacity not the skill to care for them, she says.

But Raballand says she remains hopeful. A new memorandum of understanding is on the table that could establish the Akatia sanctuary. The Côte d’Ivoire government did not respond to requests from Mongabay for confirmation about whether it was likely to succeed, or to comment on the country’s management of the wildlife trade.

David Greer, who also worked in primate conservation for 25 years, including a stint at the WWF and running a wildlife sanctuary, says he agrees that sanctuaries play a pivotal role in chimp conservation. But he says he also fears that unless they adopt a more proactive approach to law enforcement, they risk becoming dumping grounds where the rich can get rid of their chimp status symbols with impunity.

“They essentially go and dump these animals on the sanctuary’s doorsteps, with no repercussion whatsoever,” he says. When sanctuaries accept an animal, he says, part of the deal with the authorities must be that the poachers, traders and those who illegally own chimpanzees are prosecuted and proper sentences are handed down.

“Sanctuaries and big wildlife conservation organizations have to hold the government’s feet to the fire,” he says. “[They] need to enforce the law and establish deterrents.”

“In many African countries, the laws about wildlife are sadly outdated,” says PASA director Tully. “The penalties might be a couple of dollars … and maybe a night in jail, which for someone making thousands of dollars smuggling endangered species, is just part of doing business.”

Although largely supportive of sanctuaries, Greer says he believes there are other ways in which they could support the wider conservation movement, too. “They provide a humane setting for these animals to live out the remainders of their lives but that also comes with some responsibilities,” he says. “A lot of the sanctuaries work in a bubble and aren’t necessarily as collaborative as they could be.”

Most are reluctant to be audited, he says, or reveal details about the activities they are undertaking, their performance and their conservation impact. As a result, “It is difficult to measure whether these activities are having a positive impact on conservation objectives in the field.”

Sanctuary managers are passionate, Greer says, but they’re rarely traditionally trained conservationists. “Some of them are just so busy trying to ensure the welfare of the animals they are maintaining in captivity that they don’t have much time to develop strategic planning or project impact monitoring,” he says.

Many are also having to deal with a new threat, in the form of COVID-19. “Great apes are very susceptible to human respiratory diseases, as we share 98% of the same DNA,” Tully says. As a result, sanctuaries are taking extra precautions to minimize the risk of coronavirus affecting the animals, with many staff remaining on site 24/7 to reduce the risk of bringing the chimps into contact with the virus.

Kay Farmer, who helped establish the Limbe sanctuary in Cameroon, and has since completed a Ph.D. in chimpanzee reintroduction, describes sanctuaries as “a very visible example of failed conservation.” If conservation was working, she says, chimpanzees wouldn’t be coming into the sanctuaries.

It’s also easy to miss the point about why sanctuaries exist in the first place, she says. “Their raison d’être is rescuing these animals … which arrive in the most appalling conditions,” she says. “The majority are traumatized, dehydrated, they might have bullet wounds … They are experts at providing the triage … and getting those animals well again.”

Running a sanctuary is often a hand-to-mouth existence, Farmer says, with a constant battle to find operational funding. “Sanctuaries quite simply haven’t got the time or the income to be carrying out audits and collect evidence and stats,” she says. “When you’ve got to feed your animals and pay your staff, a strategic plan often isn’t at the top of your agenda.”

A distinction has also been made between individual animal welfare, as practiced by the sanctuaries, and protection on a population level, as championed by intentional conservation groups, Farmer says. As a result, many of the bigger funders simply won’t give to sanctuaries.

“There’s just not enough funding and people view each other as competition,” she says.

This theoretical competition for funds is another reason why sanctuaries have been criticized, but it’s a point Tully is quick to refute. “The money for conservation and the money for animal welfare are largely two different pots of money,” he says, with few donors giving to both.

Beyond animal welfare

While chimp welfare may be their key purpose, many sanctuaries fill a much wider role too. In 1999, Raballand took the post of project manager at Chimpanzee Conservation Center (CCC) in Guinea’s Haut Niger National Park, which now boasts the highest density of chimpanzees of any West African protected area.

The sanctuary helps run the national park, supplies rangers for anti-poaching and logging patrols, and contributes significantly to the local economy, buying more than 5 tons of food a month and employing 30 permanent staff.

The center also works with local villages. By integrating communities into conservation initiatives, Raballand says, people become “drivers of change” and develop a much greater respect for local biodiversity, leading to far fewer conflicts between humans and chimpanzees.

“Community development and education is a critical part of what we do,” Tully says. Sanctuaries are there for the long term, he says, and this allows them to build up trust with communities, play a role in alleviating poverty, and develop better relationships with the authorities.

“A sanctuary isn’t just about taking care of the animals. They have strong connections with the government and have spent years pushing to make changes happen and get government officials to realize that these chimpanzees have value as an iconic species,” Tully says.

The Tacugama sanctuary in Sierra Leonne was set up by Sri Lankan-born Bala Amarasekaran in 1995, and since then its success has been based on a mixture of hard work and shrewd diplomacy.

“Other sanctuaries and conservation organizations talk of road blocks and problems with government – I have never experienced that,” Amarasekaran says. “We work very closely with the government and they don’t look at us as an outside entity. Tacugama is considered to be one of theirs.”

One of Amarasekaran’s key achievements has been persuading the government to declare the chimpanzee the national animal. It gave him the leverage to push for changes to Sierra Leone’s out-of-date wildlife laws too, and give the new national symbol greater protection against traffickers and poachers. “You can’t make the chimpanzee the national animal and then not have laws to protect it,” he says.

Yet in all this, Amarasekaran says he is careful to make sure it is the authorities, not the sanctuary, that takes the plaudits. “You focus on the goal, not about who did it.”

Babar Turay, a conservation manager at Sierra Leone’s National Protected Area Authority, an agency within the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security, has worked closely with Amarasekaran. “If we didn’t have Tacugama, where would we be taking all these captured chimpanzees?” he says. “Do you just capture them and return them to the forest? [Then] they will be vulnerable and people will capture them again.”

Because of their autonomy, Turay says sanctuaries have an important role to play in “making a noise,” raising international and community awareness, and forcing governments into action. “That is the power that we do not have directly,” he says.

At Tacugama, Amarasekaran says, we “don’t just focus on confiscations and running an orphanage; we are movement, we do a lot more.”

The sanctuary has been running an outreach program for 12 years and now works with 70 communities across Sierra Leone. These strong community links also help with law enforcement. Recently, when animal traffickers were tipped off that the authorities were closing in, they fled. However, Amarasekaran was able to go on the radio and make a plea to local communities that their national animal was under threat. Within 30 minutes they were inundated with phone calls about the poachers’ whereabouts. “People felt a sense of duty,” he says.

Tacugama also runs eco-lodges and yoga retreats, providing employment and reinforcing the idea that primates are more valuable alive than dead.

“If you don’t create some sort of a value for the people … in the areas that we are asking them to protect, how are they going to protect these places?” he says. “If that connection is not made, then we are wasting our time.”

Ecotourism is also an important income stream for the project, he says. Big conservation groups might get multimillion-dollar research grants, but sanctuaries don’t attract that kind of money. “Sanctuaries are sometimes considered to be some roadside circus,” Amarasekaran says.

“We are a very proud organization,” he says. “We don’t go around with our hat begging. Sixty percent of our operational costs come from within, by our own initiatives.”

While Amarasekaran describes reintroductions as “every sanctuary manager’s dream,” the reality can be different. Rehabilitating and releasing a chimpanzee back into the wild is expensive.

Space is also at a premium, Amarasekaran says. Sierra Leone only has around 6% of its natural forest left and it’s impossible to release chimps into an area where other wild chimps already exist, and pointless re-releasing them where they can’t be given any protection. So, he says, “we have decided to focus on the 5,000-6,000 chimps that are still left in the wild and … on stopping them coming to the sanctuary.”

Tully says he agrees. “Great ape reintroductions are extremely complicated, expensive, and time-consuming, and aren’t possible in many countries because of the high risk of poaching and weak enforcement of protected areas,” he says. “It’s not just a case of opening a cage door and letting them go.”

Most PASA sanctuaries are huge forest enclosures where young chimpanzees can learn to climb, to socializes, and to recognize dangers, such as venomous snakes. But in all, PASA has released just 61 chimpanzees back into the wild, although 200 more live on large islands, where they can mix with other chimp populations and remain safe while living with little human care.

“For these reasons, while PASA members would like to reintroduce more primates to the wild, it isn’t a top priority,” Tully says. “To me, this underscores the importance of long-term care for confiscated primates — without this piece of the puzzle, law enforcement can break down.”

“It’s unfair to think that sanctuaries are not doing enough,” Amarasekaran says. “Sanctuaries can do a lot more simply because sanctuaries invest in the country; other big organizations, they come and go.

“We have gone through rebel wars, we have gone through Ebola, we have gone through a lot of civil strife — we never left.”

Staff at Twycross Zoo have admitted they are ""fighting to protect its future"" as it falls further into debt while its gates are closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Today, May 26, marks the 100-acre zoo's 57th birthday after first opening its doors in 1963. Back then it enjoyed record-breaking visitor numbers in its opening year.

However, in stark contrast, the zoo, which is home to 500 animals from 125 species, is now struggling to raise the £650,000 a month it needs to keep operating, having been closed for almost three months.

Dr Sharon Redrobe, CEO of Twycross Zoo, said: ""This milestone is bittersweet for us.

""It's an incredible achievement to be open for 57 years, however without our visitors it's not as happy as it should be.

""We're experiencing a very uncertain time, and we've never been closed this long in our history.""

While the Government has set up a fund to help some small zoos, Twycross Zoo is not eligible as its too large, with bosses there saying different support is desperately needed from the Government to protect its future and and its animals.

Dr Redrobe added: ""In order to keep operating the zoo has been relying on its reserves, which run out in June, as well as donations from its many supporters.

""It is vital that this work continues in support of the UK's commitment to global biodiversity.

""It still costs us over half a million pounds a month to run the zoo even while we're closed, and there are no grants from the Government for large zoos like us undertaking critical conservation work and caring for such large groups of endangered species.

""Every day we are shut is getting us more into debt.

""We are hopeful as a 100-acre outdoor site with plenty of space that we will be able to reopen to visitors in the not too distant future.

""While we've been shut we have worked to ensure our staff have a safe environment and we have been working on measures to observe social distancing and hygiene guidelines on site for our visitors.

""We are working on many changes to how we operate to ensure that when we do open we will be 'Covid-19 secure' in line with all Government guidelines, and we will share details of this soon.

""Opening again will provide a Covid-19 secure environment for families to relax and enjoy nature, as well as some much-needed income and a sigh of relief for the future of our zoo.""

Sad loss of one of the zoo's apes

The zoo has also announced the death of its elderly chimpanzee, Tojo, on May 20.

The ape, who had previously been diagnosed with heart disease, had been under the weather for a few days.

The zoo's expert team needed to do a full medical check to find out what was wrong and start any treatment and, of course chimpanzees need an anaesthetic for this, but unfortunately, despite best efforts, she was too poorly to recover from general anaesthetic, said a spokesman.

Tojo, was 43 years old and came to Twycross Zoo in 1980.

Twycross started from humble beginnings when founders Molly Badham and Nathalie Evans had a love of primates and created the zoo after outgrowing their small site in Hints, Staffordshire and moving to Twycross to open the zoo in 1963.

Since then the zoo has evolved into a world-renowned conservation charity zoo, winning countless awards for animal welfare, education and business.

Only six months ago the zoo had enjoyed its best year ever in 2019 with record-breaking visitor numbers and announced its 2030 Vision, which included developing a national centre for science and conservation in the heart of the Midlands at Twycross Zoo.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Kianga, the Little Rock Zoo's newest chimpanzee, arrived on March 3 from Albuquerque, N.M., officials said Thursday. (Special to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette/Catherine Tidwell)

The Little Rock Zoo welcomed a new chimpanzee last month, officials announced Thursday.

Kianga is a 13-year-old female chimp who came to Little Rock from the Albuquerque Biological Park on a breeding recommendation from the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Chimpanzee Species Survival Plan. She arrived March 3.

According to her keepers, Kianga is petite but savvy and has already made friends with the other chimps, the zoo said in a news release.

Since Kianga’s arrival, the zoo has closed due to the covid-19 pandemic, but anyone interested in learning about her and the zoo’s other chimpanzees can watch a video posted on the zoo’s Facebook page on Sunday.

The zoo is also hosting daily virtual tours on Facebook. See the zoo's website for details.

Thirteen is considered adult age for female chimpanzees, a Little Rock Zoo employee said in the video, while males reach adult age around 15 or 16.

@WLTradeNews;@WLTradeNews;NA;NA;2020-06-18;"Lip smacks made by chimpanzees follow a rhythm similar to human speech, according to a new study.

Monkeys are known to use this facial gesture, characterised by fast-paced cycles of vertical jaw movement, to communicate with each other.

But scientists have, for the first time, observed these mouth signals in a great ape and found their lip smacks to have the same pace of human spoken language.

They believe their findings, published in the journal Biology Letters, could be a “critical step” towards unlocking the mystery of how speech evolved in humans.

Humans are thought to open their mouths between two and seven times per second while talking, with each open-close cycle corresponding to a syllable.

Two chimpanzees grooming each other (Dr Catherine Hobaiter/University of St Andrews)

This speech-like rhythm has also been observed in other monkey species such as gibbons, orangutans and macaques.

However, the lip smacks of African great apes, the closest species to humans, had never been studied.

So a team of researchers, which included scientists from St Andrews University, the University of York and the University of Warwick, looked at data from four chimpanzee populations.

They analysed the video recordings of these primates from Edinburgh Zoo and Leipzig Zoo in Germany, alongside footage collected from wild communities in Uganda, including the Kanyawara and the Waibira.

Researchers found that chimpanzees made lip smacks while grooming another, opening and closing their mouths at an average of four times per second.

According to the experts, these findings confirm that human speech has “ancient roots within primate communication”.

They believe these mouth signals may have played a role in the evolution of a vocal system in humans that laid the foundation for speech.

Study author Dr Adriano Lameira, from the department of psychology at the University of Warwick, said: “Our results prove that spoken language was pulled together within our ancestral lineage using ‘ingredients’ that were already available and in use by other primates and hominids.

“This dispels much of the scientific enigma that language evolution has represented so far.”

He added: “We found pronounced differences in rhythm between chimpanzee populations, suggesting that these are not the automatic and stereotypical signals so often attributed to our ape cousins.

“Instead, just like in humans, we should start seriously considering that individual differences, social conventions and environmental factors may play a role in how chimpanzees engage ‘in conversation’ with one another.”";Chimpanzee lip smacks offer new insight into the evolution of human speech;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV2ZW5pbmdleHByZXNzLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvc2NvdGxhbmQvY2hpbXBhbnplZS1saXAtc21hY2tzLW9mZmVyLW5ldy1pbnNpZ2h0LWludG8tdGhlLWV2b2x1dGlvbi1vZi1odW1hbi1zcGVlY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/05/2.9295748-scaled.jpg;05/26/2020;[{'sent': 'Humans are thought to open their mouths between two and seven times per second while talking, with each open-close cycle corresponding to a syllable.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['between two and seven']}}, {'sent': 'Two chimpanzees grooming each other (Dr Catherine Hobaiter/University of St Andrews)\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two'], 'PERSON': ['Catherine Hobaiter'], 'ORG': ['University of St Andrews']}}, {'sent': 'So a team of researchers, which included scientists from St Andrews University, the University of York and the University of Warwick, looked at data from four chimpanzee populations.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the University of York', 'the University of Warwick', 'St Andrews University'], 'CARDINAL': ['four']}}, {'sent': 'They analysed the video recordings of these primates from Edinburgh Zoo and Leipzig Zoo in Germany, alongside footage collected from wild communities in Uganda, including the Kanyawara and the Waibira.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Waibira', 'Edinburgh Zoo', 'Leipzig Zoo'], 'GPE': ['Uganda', 'Germany']}}, {'sent': 'Researchers found that chimpanzees made lip smacks while grooming another, opening and closing their mouths at an average of four times per second.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['four']}}, {'sent': 'Dr Adriano Lameira, from the department of psychology at the University of Warwick, said: “Our results prove that spoken language was pulled together within our ancestral lineage using ‘ingredients’ that were already available and in use by other primates and hominids.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Adriano Lameira'], 'ORG': ['the University of Warwick']}}]
