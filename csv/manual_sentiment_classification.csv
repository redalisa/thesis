 Woylie;Bettongia penicillata;Australia;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Diprotodontia;Potoroidae;Bettongia;penicillata;I;Australia;;"A new Australian tick species discovered in Western Australia is the first to be formally recognised in more than 50 years.

The new tick was named Ixodes woyliei because it has a taste for a rare marsupial called a woylie.

Woylies, or brush-tailed bettongs, were once found across more than 60 per cent of mainland Australia but are now critically endangered in WA and endangered nationally.

Predation by foxes and feral cats and possibly disease have caused woylie populations to crash by 90 per cent in seven years, according to Murdoch University parasitology researcher Amanda Ash.

Dr Ash told ABC Radio Perth it was the first Australian Ixodes tick species to be described in a scientific journal in more than 50 years.

""We thought it might have been a different species but it can be a little bit tricky sometimes to actually confirm that,"" she said.

""Just recently, we've been able to get some DNA and work out the genetics of it and compare it to other species.""

""It is a brand-new tick for Australia.""

Dr Ash, her colleagues and Department of Parks and Wildlife staff have studied woylies for the past decade to determine if parasite infection could be contributing to their dwindling numbers.

The researchers collected ticks from the two remaining woylie populations in southwest WA — Dryandra Woodland near Narrogin and the Upper Warren Region near Manjimup.

They also studied woylies at Karakamia Wildlife Sanctuary near Gidgegannup, 50 kilometres northeast of Perth.

The new tick was found on 42 per cent of the woylies sampled.

The researchers studied 268 other marsupials in the same areas and only found Ixodes woyliei on two animals.

Dr Ash said the newly-discovered tick's strong preference for woylies puts it at risk of extinction.

Dr Ash said frequent woylie translocations, which involved treatment for parasites, meant there was a ""very real risk of a future co-extinction event.""

While that could be bad news for the tick, the good news for woylies is the new tick is not thought to be contributing to the marsupials' decline by transmitting parasite infections.

""Because this guy seems to be very specific to the woylie and this blood parasite is found in other creatures, we don't think [the tick] is bad to the woylie in that perspective,"" Dr Ash said.

She said more research was needed to understand the relationship between the parasite and its host.

""You would think after the massive reduction in available hosts, you would jump ship at some point and find someone else to jump onto,"" Dr Ash said.

""It doesn't seem to have done so. Why that is, we just don't know.""

The research was published in the scientific journal Parasites and Vectors in February.";New Australian tick species discovered for first time in more than 50 years;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDE3LTAzLTA5L25ldy1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLXRpY2stZGlzY292ZXJlZC1mb3ItZmlyc3QtdGltZS1pbi1tb3JlLXRoYW4tNTAteS84MzM4ODQw0gEmaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzgzMzg4NDA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/8338776-16x9-large.jpg?v=6;2017-03-09;"[{'sent': 'Woylies, or brush-tailed bettongs, were once found across more than 60 per cent of mainland Australia but are now critically endangered in WA and endangered nationally.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['more than'], 'GPE': ['Australia'], 'ORG': ['WA']}}, {'sent': 'Predation by foxes and feral cats and possibly disease have caused woylie populations to crash by 90 per cent in seven years, according to Murdoch University parasitology researcher Amanda Ash.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['90 per cent'], 'ORG': ['Murdoch University'], 'PERSON': ['Amanda Ash']}}, {'sent': 'Dr Ash told ABC Radio Perth it was the first Australian Ixodes tick species to be described in a scientific journal in more than 50 years.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Ash', 'ABC Radio Perth']}}, {'sent': '""It is a brand-new tick for Australia.""\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Australia']}}, {'sent': 'Aileen Elliot, Murdoch University )\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Aileen Elliot'], 'ORG': ['Murdoch University']}}, {'sent': 'Dr Ash, her colleagues and Department of Parks and Wildlife staff have studied woylies for the past decade to determine if parasite infection could be contributing to their dwindling numbers.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ash'], 'ORG': ['Wildlife', 'Department of Parks']}}, {'sent': 'The researchers collected ticks from the two remaining woylie populations in southwest WA — Dryandra Woodland near Narrogin and the Upper Warren Region near Manjimup.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two'], 'PERSON': ['Dryandra Woodland'], 'GPE': ['Narrogin', 'the Upper Warren Region'], 'ORG': ['Manjimup']}}, {'sent': 'They also studied woylies at Karakamia Wildlife Sanctuary near Gidgegannup, 50 kilometres northeast of Perth.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Karakamia', 'Perth', 'Gidgegannup'], 'QUANTITY': ['50 kilometres']}}, {'sent': 'The new tick was found on 42 per cent of the woylies sampled.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['42 per cent']}}, {'sent': 'The researchers studied 268 other marsupials in the same areas and only found Ixodes woyliei on two animals.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['268', 'two']}}, {'sent': ""Dr Ash said the newly-discovered tick's strong preference for woylies puts it at risk of extinction.\n\n"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Ash']}}, {'sent': 'Woylie populations in southwest WA have dived over the past decade.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['WA']}}, {'sent': '( Supplied: Murdoch University )\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Murdoch University']}}, {'sent': 'Dr Ash said frequent woylie translocations, which involved treatment for parasites, meant there was a ""very real risk of a future co-extinction event.""\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Ash'], 'PERSON': ['woylie translocations']}}, {'sent': '""Because this guy seems to be very specific to the woylie and this blood parasite is found in other creatures, we don\'t think [the tick] is bad to the woylie in that perspective,"" Dr Ash said.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ash']}}, {'sent': '""You would think after the massive reduction in available hosts, you would jump ship at some point and find someone else to jump onto,"" Dr Ash said.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ash']}}, {'sent': 'The research was published in the scientific journal Parasites and Vectors in February.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Parasites and Vectors']}}]";Negative
 Babirusa;Babyrousa babyrussa;Indonesia;Vulnerable;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Artiodactyla;Suidae;Babyrousa;babyrussa;I;Indonesia;;"THREE of the world’s rarest pigs have been born at Chester Zoo.

The tiny trio of babirusa piglets arrived to mum Kendari, six, following a pregnancy of five months.

It is the first time ever that babirusa triplets have been born at the zoo – a rare occurrence which is thought to only happen in around four per cent of babirusa births.

And as we are still enjoying some of the hottest days of the year, the little piggies found the perfect way to cool off by taking a bath in mud, glorious mud!

Babirusa are found on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia where their numbers have crashed to fewer than 5,000. They were once viewed as common but a proliferation of hunting for their meat and habitat loss has seen them disappear from many parts of the island.

Tim Rowlands, Curator of Mammals, said: “Babirusa are, without question, one of the of the rarest pig species on the planet. It’s an animal that’s extremely vulnerable to extinction and under huge pressure for its long term survival.

“We’re fighting alongside Indonesian conservationists and the Indonesian government to reverse the decline of the babirusa in its homeland.

“Chester Zoo is also one of the world leaders in breeding these charismatic pigs. By making sure there is a sustainable population in zoos, whose genetic diversity represents the genetic diversity in the wild, the global zoo community can play a vital role in saving this species from extinction. Kendari’s new trio of piglets are special additions to the world’s population.”

Conservationists from Chester Zoo are working with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and zoos in Indonesia to share husbandry practices and promote the importance of cooperative conservation breeding programmes to save the species; as well as helping to deliver education activities.

Back in the Chester, the latest set of piglets were born on 20 May. Given the sensitive nature of the species, mum had been caring for her youngsters in a special behind-the-scenes breeding area. But now, Kendari has shown off her important, playful newborns for the first time in the zoo’s babirusa habitat.

Babirusa facts:

• The piglets, which have not yet been sexed or named, were born on 20 May 2018

• Mum Kendari is six years old (born on 28/10/2011)

• Dad is called Sausu

• Babirusa go through a five-month-long pregnancy

• They feed on fruit, seeds, nuts, insects and fungi

• In Malay, the name babirusa means ‘pig deer’

• Listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction

• The species, which was once thought to be reasonably common, has largely disappeared from some areas of Sulawesi where they are targeted by hunters for their meat and threatened by the loss of their tropical rainforests habitat, as it taken over by farmers and developers.";Video & pictures: Trio of rare pigs introduce themselves at Chester Zoo with a messy mud bath;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaGVzdGVyc3RhbmRhcmQuY28udWsvbmV3cy8xNjMzMjgwNS52aWRlby1waWN0dXJlcy10cmlvLW9mLXJhcmUtcGlncy1pbnRyb2R1Y2UtdGhlbXNlbHZlcy1hdC1jaGVzdGVyLXpvby13aXRoLWEtbWVzc3ktbXVkLWJhdGgv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.chesterstandard.co.uk/resources/images/8020928/;2018-07-04;"[{'sent': 'THREE of the world’s rarest pigs have been born at Chester Zoo.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['THREE'], 'ORG': ['Chester Zoo']}}, {'sent': 'The tiny trio of babirusa piglets arrived to mum Kendari, six, following a pregnancy of five months.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Kendari'], 'CARDINAL': ['six']}}, {'sent': 'It is the first time ever that babirusa triplets have been born at the zoo – a rare occurrence which is thought to only happen in around four per cent of babirusa births.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['around four per cent']}}, {'sent': 'Babirusa are found on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia where their numbers have crashed to fewer than 5,000.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Indonesia', 'Sulawesi'], 'CARDINAL': ['fewer than 5,000']}}, {'sent': 'Tim Rowlands, Curator of Mammals, said: “Babirusa are, without question, one of the of the rarest pig species on the planet.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Tim Rowlands'], 'ORG': ['Curator of Mammals']}}, {'sent': '“Chester Zoo is also one of the world leaders in breeding these charismatic pigs.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Chester Zoo']}}, {'sent': 'Kendari’s new trio of piglets are special additions to the world’s population.”\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Kendari']}}, {'sent': 'Conservationists from Chester Zoo are working with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and zoos in Indonesia to share husbandry practices and promote the importance of cooperative conservation breeding programmes to save the species; as well as helping to deliver education activities.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['IUCN', 'the International Union for the Conservation of Nature', 'Chester Zoo'], 'GPE': ['Indonesia']}}, {'sent': 'Back in the Chester, the latest set of piglets were born on 20 May.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Chester']}}, {'sent': 'But now, Kendari has shown off her important, playful newborns for the first time in the zoo’s babirusa habitat.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Kendari']}}, {'sent': 'For more on Chester Zoo’s babirusa conservation work, see: www.actforwildlife.org.uk/conservation-news/reverse-decline-asian-wild-cattle-populations/\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Chester Zoo’s']}}, {'sent': '• Mum Kendari is six years old (born on 28/10/2011)\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Mum Kendari']}}, {'sent': '• Dad is called Sausu\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sausu']}}, {'sent': 'In Malay, the name babirusa means ‘pig deer’\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Malay']}}, {'sent': 'Listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the International Union for the Conservation of Nature', 'IUCN']}}, {'sent': 'The species, which was once thought to be reasonably common, has largely disappeared from some areas of Sulawesi where they are targeted by hunters for their meat and threatened by the loss of their tropical rainforests habitat, as it taken over by farmers and developers.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Sulawesi']}}]";Positive
Bali Myna;Leucopsar rothschildi;Indonesia;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Passeriformes;Sturnidae;Leucopsar;rothschildi;I;Indonesia;;"MIRI: The Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC) raided an illegal wildlife farm near Sibu, Sarawak and rescued more than two dozen rare mammals, endangered birds and crocodiles.

The raid was carried out last week on a plot of private land in the outskirts of Sibu.

However, specifics of the operation cannot be disclosed to ensure future raids are not jeopardised.

Among the 14 species of rare animals seized from the place were a macaque, a monkey, a sun bear, a bear-cat, several porcupines and hedgehogs, a variety of endangered birds including Oriental Pied hornbill, eagles, parrots, pigeons, Bali Myna, tortoises and two big crocodiles.

SFC chief executive officer Zolkipli Mohamad Aton told The Star that the SFC enforcement personnel carried out the surprise raid at the farm recently after gathering information.

""Investigations showed that it was an illegal wildlife farm.

""The rescued animals were sent to the Matang Wildlife Sanctuary in Kuching,"" he said.

He added that SFC would be relentless in its state-wide crackdown against wildlife abuse and exploitation.

""We mean business,"" he said.

Zolkipli said SFC was also working hard to organise education campaigns against wildlife abuses.

""Education and awareness campaigns are important too.

""Our long-term goal is to stop the abuse, trading and eating of wildlife in Sarawak.

""Any form of exploitation of protected and totally-protected species is a definite no,"" he said.

Zolkipli said those caught capturing, possessing or selling protected wildlife can be fined up to RM50,000 or jailed up to five years upon conviction.

He also urged for more public information to be channelled to the SFC hotlines set up to tackle wildlife abuse in Sarawak.

 Southern Sea Otter;Enhydra lutris nereis;Canada, Mexico, United States of America;;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Mustelidae;Enhydra;lutris;I;Canada,Mexico,United States of America;;"When the furry sea otter’s little head popped out of the water’s surface just off Crystal Cove on Thursday, Holly Fletcher and Kaitlin Magliano screamed with excitement.

The duo, who both work for the Crystal Cove Alliance, were scouting the area after word the critter had been hanging out just south of the historic cottages the past few days – a rare sighting of a mammal that seems to be coming back home to Orange County waters the past few years.

They gave him a name: Ollie the otter.

“They are so rare here, I think it’s so special to see it down here,” said Fletcher, who was armed with binoculars and cameras in anticipation of the sighting.

Julianne Steers, director of husbandry at the Ocean Institute, said there was once a prominent otter population along the Orange County coastline decades ago.

There’s been just a handful of sightings the past few years, and Steers said it’s less likely El Niño-driven like the other sea animal anomalies seen along Orange County’s coast, but more likely that there’s a food source here they are chasing. She said there’s also been word of sightings off San Clemente and San Mateo.

“I always think it’s exciting from my viewpoint, to see there’s a restoration of our ecosystem is always delightful to see,” she said. “Any little bit of hope we have to restore balance is intriguing.”

Sea otters disappeared from the area for several reasons.

First, they were overhunted. The fur trade from the late 1700s to early 1900s nearly brought the animals to extinction, but a colony of about 50 otters was discovered in 1938 in a cove near the Bixby Bridge in Big Sur.

With protection from the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, sea otters were granted protection from trapping, and their listing as an endangered species in 1973 protected them from incidental or accidental take from commercial fishing operations and protected vital habitat locations.

Then, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service implemented a program in 1987 that introduced a small species of otters to San Nicolas Island, which is part of California’s Channel Islands, in an effort to protect the federally threatened sea otter.

As part of that program, “no otter zones” were set up, which meant any otters found south of Santa Barbara County were relocated to the north. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service terminated the program in December 2012, allowing the otters to swim in their natural range, which is expected to boost recovery of the species.

A whale watching boat from Dana Wharf saw an otter off the coast of Laguna in December 2011. It was their first sighting in 30 years. Then, there were a few sightings in 2013 near Huntington Harbour and the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge.

“Since we’ve seen it a few times over the past several years, maybe it will develop into consistency,” Steers said. “But it’s a challenge to say at this point.”

Another sighting occurred Wednesday, when Yen Choi, of Aliso Viejo, was down at Strands Beach in Dana Point and saw an otter playing about 10 feet from shore. It’s hard to tell if it was the same one spotted by Fletcher.

“It was funny watching the otter just bouncing up and down in the waves and watching surfers for about 5 minutes, then disappear,” she said.

Ryan Lawler, owner of Newport Coastal Adventure, also spotted an otter on Saturday at Crystal Cove. He snapped photos of it munching on a lobster.

The otter population was once estimated at around 16,000. The southern sea otter once roamed the Pacific coast from the Oregon/Washington border down to Baja, Mexico.

Over the past 100 years, otters have expanded from the Morro Bay area north and south. In 2012, the population was estimated at 2,792, according to a 2012 U.S. Geological Survey. In 2014, that number rose to 2,944.

Fletcher has traveled several times to Northern California to see the otters, but this is the first time she’s seen one in her own backyard.

Fletcher said Ollie’s appearance is testament that conservation efforts in the area are paying off. They watched as it had two lunches – first an octopus, and then a lobster. The otter floated on its back, the meals resting on its tummy while it munched.

The increased food supply for the otter could be credited to Crystal Cove being a marine conservation area, where fishing is limited at certain times of the year. Studies show there are a lot of fish and plankton in the area, she said.

“I think the greatest message is the conservation is working if they are making their way down here,” Fletcher said.

Behavior and conservation of the Amazon’s giant river otter.

Charismatic, vocal, unpredictable, domestic, and playful are all adjectives that aptly describe the giant river otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), one of the Amazon’s most spectacular big mammals. As its name suggest, this otter is the longest member of the weasel family: from tip of the nose to tail’s end the otter can measure 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. Living in closely-knit family groups, sporting a complex range of behavior, and displaying almost human-like capricious moods, the giant river otter has captured a number of researchers and conservationists’ hearts, including Dutch conservationist Jessica Groenendijk.

“Otters have always had tremendous appeal for me, ever since reading Gavin Maxwell’s Ring of Bright Water, and the idea of a ‘giant’ otter was entrancing,” Groenendijk told mongabay.com in an interview. After obtaining a Masters degree in Aquatic Resource Management from King’s College, London, Groenendijk was recruited to become Project Leader of the Frankfurt Zoological Society Giant Otter Conservation Program. “I was very fortunate. Our first encounter with a giant otter family was a deeply impressive experience and I was hooked. This was the start of what I believe, and hope, will be a life-long commitment to the giant otter.”

Researchers are just beginning to untangle some of the complex familial relations in giant river otter communities, who live together in related groups of around a dozen individuals. These family groups are overseen by one breeding couple, but do pretty much everything together.

“Groups are highly cohesive: they hunt, mark their territories, sunbathe, and sleep together, with bonds constantly reinforced by mutual grooming and play,” explains Groenendijk, adding that “a giant otter family has much in common with a human family, which is why observing them over many years has something of the soap opera about it. There’s drama, bickering, unity in the face of a caiman threat, babysitting and shared feeding of the cubs, and, finally, offspring leaving home. If fate is kind, a breeding pair may stay together for up to 10 years.”

Researchers have found that these family groups practice alloparenting, which means non-parents also participate in raising cubs, not unlike many human communities. In addition, a recent observation found young otters purposefully feeding an aged matriarch, who likely had difficulty hunting for herself. Even with such insights, Groenendijk says there is much scientists don’t yet know about the private lives of giant river otters.

“We know almost nothing of the dynamics of transient animals once they have left their families. Where do they go, how far do they travel, what threats do they face, how are new groups formed? Unfortunately, telemetry in the rainforest is hampered by local conditions: we need to devise innovative ways of radio tracking giant otters.”

In addition, researchers are trying to figure out the natural causes behind giant river otter mortality: for example they believe infant mortality is high, but have had difficulty collecting data on it in the absence of bodies. Mating behavior and predator/prey relationships also remain largely obscure.

But even as scientists are making strides in uncovering giant river otter behavior, there is a sense that they are racing against time as the Amazon ecosystem faces changes from deforestation, mining, roads, and climate change. Although the giant river otter is found in ten Amazonian nations, it remains endangered. Almost driven to extinction by the pelt trade, which was banned in 1975, the giant river otter today faces a number of new and rising direct threats tyhat have held back a full recovery. A surge in gold mining, habitat destruction, pollution, conflict between humans and otters over fish resources, and even poorly-managed tourism have all injured giant river otter populations.

“Artisanal gold mining is out of control in the Department of Madre de Dios, with all the devastation this implies. The increase in gold-mining activity along the Madre de Dios, Malinowski, and Inambari Rivers has resulted in near local extinction of the species with giant otters only surviving in tributaries and lakes where there is no mining activity,” Groenendijk says, adding that this raises the question of mercury pollution from gold mining possibly “bio-accumulating in giant otters and affecting their reproductive health and survival.”

Conflict between fishermen and giant river otters is another problem unique to the species. “Giant otters are blamed, with little justification, for declining fish stocks: they are perceived to be competing with fishermen for the same species,” says Groenendijk who adds that most likely overfishing and other environmental problems are behind the decline in fish stocks in some regions, not a few otter families.

Even tourism projects can injure giant river otters by causing stress and destroying habitats, though Groenendijk says there are a number of simple measures to ensure tourists and giant river otters can co-exist, and even benefit, from controlled visits to otter lakes.

As with most endangered species, conserving the giant river otter means more than simply making sure its forests aren’t cut down explains Groenendijk: it means dealing with the artisanal, and often illegal, gold mining trade; education and awareness programs for people living near otter families; more research on the ecology of otters and a greater understanding of their habitat and prey requirements; and more and better-managed protected areas. But, in the end, the goal of achieving a thriving giant river otter population will require safeguarding the Amazon basin from a multitude of threats, a task that scientists say would benefit hundreds of thousands of species, both known and unknown, as well as all of human society.

With their playful nature, their dramatic lifestyles, and their large personalities, giant river otters could be great ambassadors for the conservation of the Amazon, both in Amazonian states and abroad.

INTERVIEW WITH JESSICA GROENENDIJK

Mongabay: What is your background?

Jessica Groenendijk: I’m a Dutch biologist turned conservationist with a Biology degree from Imperial College and an Aquatic Resource Management Masters from King’s College, London. Starting as a volunteer, I worked for 4 years at the Netherlands Committee for IUCN as Coordinator of the European Working Group on Amazonia (a network of 300 individuals, NGOs, and governmental institutions involved in conservation and sustainable development in the nine Amazon countries). This led to my becoming Project Leader of the Frankfurt Zoological Society Giant Otter Conservation Project in 1999, implementing applied research and conservation activities for this species in protected areas of the Madre de Dios region of Peru, including the development of site plans for tourism management in giant otter habitats, and education materials that have been replicated in several South American countries. I also monitored demography of key populations of the species and, in my position as Giant Otter Species Coordinator for the IUCN/SSC Otter Specialist Group, catalyzed the development of monitoring guidelines across the species distribution range, working together with giant otter specialists from 8 countries. By 2005, kids Saba and Luca had appeared on the scene, and after completing our popular/scientific book Giants of the Madre de Dios we moved to North Luangwa National Park, Zambia, where I was Technical Advisor to the North Luangwa Conservation Program of the Frankfurt Zoological Society, responsible for the monitoring of the reintroduced black rhino population, and managing the NLCP Conservation Education Program. In 2008, while in the UK, I began the analysis and write-up of 14 years of giant otter data, with the support of Oxford University’s WildCRU. This was temporarily interrupted when we moved to Cusco, Peru at the end 2010. Here since July 2011, I have been working for San Diego Zoo Global as Education and Outreach Coordinator of the beautiful Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Manu National Park. I am responsible for engaging with people from all levels of society—from local school children, to Peruvian and international students and researchers, to Protected Area staff and government officials—towards the research and conservation of tropical biodiversity.

Mongabay: What first attracted you to study giant river otters?

Jessica Groenendijk: While at university, I co-led two expeditions to Manu National Park and the Las Piedras River. We caught brief, tantalizing glimpses of giant otters during both journeys. Otters have always had tremendous appeal for me, ever since reading Gavin Maxwell’s Ring of Bright Water, and the idea of a ‘giant’ otter was entrancing. The fact that the species was endangered made our sightings all the more special, and I reported back to my then employers at the Netherlands Committee for IUCN with great enthusiasm and a sense of urgency. When the International Fund for Animal Welfare was looking for someone to carry out a desk study into the conservation status of the giant otter in South America, my boss thought of me. One thing led to another, and within two years of completing the study, I found myself in Peru, newly married, and joint Coordinator of Frankfurt Zoological Society’s Giant Otter Research and Conservation Project. I was very fortunate. Our first encounter with a giant otter family was a deeply impressive experience and I was hooked. This was the start of what I believe, and hope, will be a life-long commitment to the giant otter.

GIANT RIVER OTTER BEHAVIOR

Mongabay: Giant river otters are highly social animals. How is a family group usually structured?

Jessica Groenendijk: A family group consists of a single, monogamous breeding pair plus their offspring of several years, from tiny cubs to adults. Average group size in Manu is about 6, with the largest consisting of 14 members, in Cocha Salvador. Groups are highly cohesive: they hunt, mark their territories, sunbathe, and sleep together, with bonds constantly reinforced by mutual grooming and play. A giant otter family has much in common with a human family, which is why observing them over many years has something of the soap opera about it. There’s drama, bickering, unity in the face of a caiman threat, babysitting and shared feeding of the cubs, and, finally, offspring leaving home. If fate is kind, a breeding pair may stay together for up to 10 years.

Mongabay: How do giant river otters communicate?

Jessica Groenendijk: Loudly and frequently! Giant otters are extremely vocal and use a large number of different sounds to communicate under different circumstances. Anything unexpected or strange will be met by a series of explosive exhalations, while the otters periscope to get a better look. A mother will initiate a new activity with a lilting hum, meaning “Let’s go.” Cubs beg for fish from their older siblings with ear-splitting shrieks that can be heard hundreds of meters away. And when one wails a warning, all group members rush together and ululate at top volume, a powerful vocalization that gives me goose bumps.

Mongabay: What is ‘alloparenting’? How does this play into the giant river otters’ success?

Jessica Groenendijk: Alloparenting is where individuals other than the parents assist with the rearing of young. In giant otters, older siblings help feed cubs and juveniles by giving them fish (sometimes reluctantly!), by rushing to their defense in the face of danger, by helping to carry them from one den to another, and, occasionally, by babysitting them in the den while the mother hunts with the rest of the group. The larger a giant otter group, the more it is a force to be reckoned with. Group size plays a role in hunting success, defense against predators, and the ability to hold on to a territory. Alloparenting helps to increase the survival rate of cubs and juveniles, and hence increases group size.

Mongabay: A 2010 study recorded young giant river otters giving food to an elderly matriarch. Does this study’s findings fit with your own observations of giant river otters?

Jessica Groenendijk: Actually, I believe this is the first time such behavior has been recorded, by Lisa Davenport. I’m familiar with the giant otter group involved. The matriarch was at least 13 years old when she finally disappeared, to be replaced by her daughter. During her last year, she was much less mobile and Lisa witnessed the neat reversal of roles you mention. The male of the group was a relative newcomer and the old female’s knowledge of the territory may well have been her only, but significant, contribution to the group’s well-being. However anthropomorphic it may seem, I’m sure that strong familial bonds also played a role.

Mongabay: What are some research questions regarding behavior that you would really like to see addressed?

Jessica Groenendijk: Where do I start?! Over the years of giant otter observation, many intriguing questions have surfaced. In fact, the more we learn, the more we wonder! Unfortunately, the most interesting may the most difficult to address. For example, we know very little about natural giant otter mortality factors. Incredibly, during years of research in Madre de Dios, we found only one dead giant otter, a decomposing newborn cub at the entrance of a den. We do know that cub mortality is high, but can only guess at the causes. We have our suspects: attacks by caiman, high parasite load, and abandonment by stressed or inexperienced mothers, amongst others. Incidents in Brazil suggest that conflicts between otter groups or between transient individuals (and groups) may be an important mortality factor.

We know a little now about the ecology and behavior of giant otter groups. However, we know almost nothing of the dynamics of transient animals once they have left their families. Where do they go, how far do they travel, what threats do they face, how are new groups formed? Unfortunately, telemetry in the rainforest is hampered by local conditions: we need to devise innovative ways of radio tracking giant otters.

Another big question concerns genetics. For example, how related are the individuals in a giant otter group? Are the breeding pair really monogamous, or does a transient male occasionally manage to sneak a mating when the resident male isn’t paying attention? Some studies have been carried out using fecal samples, but since group members enthusiastically mix their scat on latrines, it has proved almost impossible to identify individuals. Giant otter researchers are beginning to explore ways around this problem and it will be extremely interesting to see what they find.

Lastly (although if you asked another giant otter specialist the same question, you would get a different list of priorities), it would be useful to learn more about predator/prey relationships. We know that giant otters each consume up to 4kg of fish daily, and we know the species they prefer. But what impact do they have on fish populations, or vice versa? And with artisanal gold mining rife in Madre de Dios, is mercury bio-accumulating in giant otters and affecting their reproductive health and survival?

ENDANGERED: MINING, CONFLICT, AND TOURISM

Mongabay: Historically what was the big threat to this river mammal?

Jessica Groenendijk: Hunting for the pelt trade throughout its range was the single, greatest threat to the giant otter and is directly responsible for its current endangered status (although more recent threat factors are contributing to the maintenance of this status). Between 1946 and 1973, 23,980 giant otter pelts were officially exported from Peru alone, excluding those skins which were exported via Leticia, Colombia. The export of pelts from Peru was banned in 1970 and professional hunting of wildlife in the Peruvian Amazon was prohibited in 1973. But it was the inclusion of the giant otter in Appendix I of CITES in 1973, and the coming into force of international trade restrictions on giant otter skins in 1975 that finally ended the economic benefits of giant otter hunting.

Mongabay: What are the major threats to giant river otters in Peru today?

Jessica Groenendijk: Habitat loss, human/giant otter conflict (over fish resources), and contamination of aquatic ecosystems due to gold mining are probably the most important threats right now. Giant otters are blamed, with little justification, for declining fish stocks: they are perceived to be competing with fishermen for the same species. Artisanal gold mining is out of control in the Department of Madre de Dios, with all the devastation this implies. The increase in gold-mining activity along the Madre de Dios, Malinowski, and Inambari Rivers has resulted in near local extinction of the species with giant otters only surviving in tributaries and lakes where there is no mining activity.

Mongabay: Do they face different threats elsewhere?

Jessica Groenendijk: No, threats are similar (to a lesser or greater degree) in other countries of the giant otter’s distributional range. It is interesting that human/giant otter conflict is emerging as an increasingly common problem. Although it is true that in some few areas giant otter populations are slowly recovering, the issue is much more likely a product of overfishing by humans themselves. Infrastructure and hydroelectric development is perhaps a greater threat in Brazil. And poorly managed tourism—the subject of intensive effort in Peru by the Frankfurt Zoological Society and their counterparts in Peru’s Protected Area Service (SERNANP)—has been mentioned as an emerging problem in Brazil and Bolivia.

Mongabay: Illegal gold mining has become a major problem on the Madre de Dios. How does this impact giant river otter populations?

Jessica Groenendijk: I recently read in a paper by Swenson et al that the Department of Madre de Dios is Peru’s third largest producer of gold and generates 70% of Peru’s artisanal gold production. Over the last decade, the price of gold has increased 360% with a constant rate of increase of about 18% per year. Peruvian mercury imports have risen 42% between 2006 and 2009 to 130 t/yr, almost all of which is used directly in artisanal gold mining. Forest conversion to mining increased six-fold from 2003-2006 (292ha/yr) to 2006-2009 (1915ha/yr). Gutleb, Schenck and Staib found in 1997 that mercury concentrations in the majority of fish in the area of Manu National Park were higher than what is considered tolerable in the Eurasian otter. But the expected high concentrations of methylmercury in giant otter tissues have not been corroborated due to the difficulty of finding dead giant otters. In any case, habitat destruction is the most immediate and severe impact of gold mining: surveys by the Frankfurt Zoological Society in 2008 and 2010 in areas with gold-mining failed to find any sign of giant otter presence.

Mongabay: What are the best estimates of total population? Why are such estimates so hard to get?

Jessica Groenendijk: I’m reluctant to put forward a best estimate for total population size since we really don’t know. Someone once threw the number 5,000 into the air, and this has been cited repeatedly, but I believe it was a rather wild guess. As a result of surveys, we have good estimates for some river systems but not for any country as a whole. Giant otters occur in a wide variety of often remote and inaccessible habitats in the lowland rainforest and wetlands of at least 10 South American countries with complex political realities; these are difficult conditions for obtaining reliable estimates.

TARGETED CONSERVATION AND EDUCATION

Mongabay: Is tourism a threat to giant river otters?

Jessica Groenendijk: Tourism and giant otters can have a troubled relationship, depending on how tourism is managed (or not). The giant otter is one of very few large, endangered mammals that are relatively easily observed in the rainforest. It inhabits rivers and lakes, the ‘highways’ of this complex ecosystem, in stable territories that often become accessible, reliable destinations for tourist excursions. Giant otters are highly social, living in vocal family groups that hunt by day. They are attractive and active; in short, this charismatic animal easily becomes a focal point for tourism. But to place too much emphasis on a single species as a tourist attraction is risky; it can result in disappointed visitors if their expectations are not met, in guides who feel pressured to come up with the goods and so may go to considerable lengths to satisfy their customers, and in otters that learn, through bitter experience, to avoid human presence.

Very often, it is a question of misunderstanding. Giant otters react to people as they do to caimans, perceiving us as a potential threat. Their characteristic behavior is one of warning. By approaching rapidly and periscoping around us while repeatedly uttering loud snorts, they are informing us that we are invading their space and that they are alarmed. But we interpret this attitude as one of tameness. If we then fail to acknowledge their warning and row even closer to take the perfect photograph, the otters eventually feel forced to move on. In future encounters, they will learn to steer clear of this ‘super predator,’ and tourists will no longer have satisfactory viewing experiences. This is just one example of how poorly managed tourism can reduce habitat quality for giant otters. However, not only do we sometimes interfere with their activities on the water, we also build infrastructure and clear paths directly along shorelines, thereby preventing otters from constructing their dens or latrines.

A far more serious impact of tourism is lowered reproductive success. The height of the tourism season in Peru is preceded by a few months by a peak in giant otter births; in August/September, most otter families are rearing up to four vulnerable cubs in their den. Giant otters, especially the parents, are much more nervous at this time of year. In zoos, it was discovered to everybody’s surprise that females may fail to nurse their cubs as a result of stress induced by visitors. They are surrounded by people all year round, yet when they have cubs, captive otters become highly sensitive to outside influences.

Experience in Peru has shown that tourism and giant otters can co-exist harmoniously, even thrive together, if the former is managed in such a way as to respect the needs of the latter. Giant otters prefer large oxbow lakes with plenty of fish and high, path-free shorelines for building dens and latrines. If tourism could take these habitat requirements into account, then not only would giant otters benefit by being able to lead uninterrupted lives, their cubs safe, but our chances of observing these wonderful animals for long periods in their natural habitat would be greatly increased since they would feel at ease in our presence. Such an extraordinary experience would bring us back to the rainforest time and again.

So what can we do as responsible guides, lodge owners and tourists? Guides should inform themselves as well as possible about giant otter biology and behaviour. A minimum observation distance between ourselves and the otters should be maintained, and binoculars should be used at all times. Lodges should not be constructed directly on lake shores and paths should be cleared away from the shoreline, at least 100 meters inland. Boats should be rowed slowly and quietly along a fixed route, and a zone in each lake should be set aside as a refuge for giant otters and other animals. In addition to finding alternatives to lake excursions, fixed observation points (hides, towers, platforms) should replace boats as much as possible; these are static, predictable sources of disturbance that do not interfere with otter activities and which the animals can avoid if they wish. But experience in south-eastern Peru has shown that they don’t.

Tourism is a rapidly growing economic activity in the Peruvian Amazon, the majority concentrated on its lakes and rivers. But, if well managed, it is also one of the few industries that is ecologically sustainable and that can bring much-needed revenues to Peru’s protected areas. Provided we understand and accept that, like us, giant otters need space and tranquility, my belief is that tourism and giant otter conservation can be compatible.

Mongabay: Why are education efforts with locals important for giant river otters?



Early morning on Cocha Salvador, Manu National Park. Photo by: Frank Hajek.

Jessica Groenendijk: A large proportion of Peruvians living in cities and towns, even those in the rainforest like Puerto Maldonado or Iquitos, have little opportunity to experience nature first-hand, while for much of the remaining rural population the pressing struggle of day-to-day life precludes an appreciation or understanding of nature. The resulting negative human perceptions, often born of ignorance—that giant otters are dangerous, that cubs make fun pets, that populations are growing, and that they will eat one out of house and home—can only be modified by communication of the facts obtained through objective research. The importance of environmental education as a conservation tool is often underestimated, yet it is key to influencing human behaviors, with positive outcomes such as reducing human wildlife conflicts and promoting the conservation of biodiversity.

Mongabay: What measures would you like to see giant river otter countries take to save the species?

Jessica Groenendijk: I would like to see them create new protected areas and better manage existing ones, promote the giant otter as an ambassador of aquatic habitats in local education curricula, and generate funds for local giant otter research and conservation action.

High gold price triggers rainforest devastation in Peru

(10/11/2011) As the price of gold inches upward on international markets, a dead zone is spreading across the southern Peruvian rain forest. Tourists flying to Manu or Tambopata, the crown jewels of the country’s Amazonian parks, get a jarring view of a muddy, cratered moonscape … and then another … and another in what the country boasts is its capital of biodiversity. While alluvial gold mining in the Amazon is probably older than the Incas, miners using motorized suction equipment, huge floating dredges and backhoes are plowing through the landscape on an unprecedented scale, leaving treeless scars visible from outer space. Sources close to the Peruvian Environment Ministry say the government is considering declaring an environmental emergency in the region, but emergency measures passed two years ago were not enough to contain the destruction, and some observers doubt that a new decree would have any more impact.

Deforestation, climate change threaten the ecological resilience of the Amazon rainforest

(01/19/2012) The combination of deforestation, forest degradation, and the effects of climate change are weakening the resilience of the Amazon rainforest ecosystem, potentially leading to loss of carbon storage and changes in rainfall patterns and river discharge, finds a comprehensive review published in the journal Nature.

Ecotourism isn’t bad for wildlife in the Amazon

(11/23/2011) Ecotourism doesn’t hurt biodiversity, and in some cases may even safeguard vulnerable areas, concludes a new study from the Amazon in Mammalian Biology. Surveying large mammals in an ecotourism area in Manu National Biosphere, the researchers found that ecotourists had no effect on the animals. However, the researchers warn that not all ecotourism is the same, and some types may, in fact, hurt the very animals tourists come to see.

Loving the tapir: pioneering conservation for South America’s biggest animal

(09/11/2011) Compared to some of South America’s megafauna stand-out species—the jaguar, the anaconda, and the harpy eagle come to mind—the tapir doesn’t get a lot of love. This is a shame. For one thing, they’re the largest terrestrial animal on the South American continent: pound-for-pound they beat both the jaguar and the llama. For another they play a very significant role in their ecosystem: they disperse seeds, modify habitats, and are periodic prey to big predators. For another, modern tapirs are some of the last survivors of a megafauna family that roamed much of the northern hemisphere, including North America, and only declined during the Pleistocene extinction. Finally, for anyone fortunate enough to have witnessed the often-shy tapir in the wild, one knows there is something mystical and ancient about these admittedly strange-looking beasts.

Cameratraps take global snapshot of declining tropical mammals

(08/17/2011) A groundbreaking cameratrap study has mapped the abundance, or lack thereof, of tropical mammal populations across seven countries in some of the world’s most important rainforests. Undertaken by The Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring Network (TEAM), the study found that habitat loss was having a critical impact on mammals. The study, which documented 105 mammals (nearly 2 percent of the world’s known mammals) on three continents, also confirmed that mammals fared far better—both in diversity and abundance—in areas with continuous forest versus areas that had been degraded.

Climate change and deforestation pose risk to Amazon rainforest

(05/20/2011) Deforestation and climate change will likely decimate much of the Amazon rainforest, says a new study by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) and the UK’s Met Office Hadley Centre. Climate change and widespread deforestation is expected to cause warmer and drier conditions overall, reducing the resistance of the rainforest ecosystem to natural and human-caused stressors while increasing the frequency of extreme rainfall events and droughts by the end of this century. While climate models show that higher temperatures resulting from global climate change will threaten the resilience of the Amazon, current deforestation is an immediate concern to the rainforest ecosystem and is likely driving regional changes in climate.

Demand for gold pushing deforestation in Peruvian Amazon

(04/19/2011) Deforestation is on the rise in Peru’s Madre de Dios region from illegal, small-scale, and dangerous gold mining. In some areas forest loss has increased up to six times. But the loss of forest is only the beginning; the unregulated mining is likely leaching mercury into the air, soil, and water, contaminating the region and imperiling its people. Using satellite imagery from NASA, researchers were able to follow rising deforestation due to artisanal gold mining in Peru. According the study, published in PLoS ONE, Two large mining sites saw the loss of 7,000 hectares of forest (15,200 acres)—an area larger than Bermuda—between 2003 and 2009.

First strike against illegal gold mining in Peru: military destroys miners’ boats

(02/21/2011) Around a thousand Peruvian soldiers and police officers destroyed seven and seized thirteen boats used by illegal gold miners in the Peruvian Amazon, reports the AFP. The move is seen as a first strike against the environmentally destructive mining. Used to pump silt up from the river-bed, the boats are essential tools of the illegal gold mining trade which is booming in parts of the Amazon.

Guyana bans gold mining in the ‘Land of the Giants’

(03/01/2010) Guyana has banned gold dredging in the Rewa Head region of the South American country after pressure from Amerindian communities in the area. A recent expedition to Rewa Head turned up unspoiled wilderness and mind-boggling biodiversity. The researchers, in just six weeks, stumbled on the world’s largest snake (anaconda), spider (the aptly named goliath bird-eating spider), armadillo (the giant armadillo), anteater (the giant anteater), and otter (the giant otter), leading them to dub the area ‘the Land of the Giants’. “During our brief survey we had encounters with wildlife that tropical biologists can spend years in the field waiting for. On a single day we had two tapirs paddle alongside our boat, we were swooped on by a crested eagle and then later charged by a group of giant otters.”

 Indian Bustard;Ardeotis nigriceps;India, Nepal, Pakistan;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Gruiformes;Otididae;Ardeotis;nigriceps;I;India,Pakistan;;"Mindless management of grasslands along with unabated hunting has resulted in the gradual extermination of one of the largest flying birds that can stand tall up to one metre height — the Great Indian Bustard (GIB — Ardeotis nigriceps).





According to the 2011 census, there were nearly 250 GIBs surviving in entire India, with the majority of them living in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Today, wildlife experts say that the figure might have come down to below 100, with 90 per cent of its former ranges and protected areas recording no sighting (extirpated) in the last few years. According to experts, at present, eight to 13 GIBs might be surviving in the wilds of Karnataka.



The bird, in 2011, was ‘up-listed’ from endangered to critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) and was brought under the Schedule-I (the highest protection status) of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.



“Just a quarter century ago, these birds were common and were seen even on the outskirts of Bengaluru and Tumakuru. However, today with rampant hunting and destruction of its habitat, very few are surviving in the arid regions of the Deccan Plateau of Karnataka,” says wildlife expert Santosh Martin, who along with another environmentalist Samad Kottur, both members of Society for Wildlife and Nature (SWaN), traced a GIB family — male, female and a four-month-old chick — in the fields of Siruguppa in Ballari district recently.



They have been tracking GIBs for the last 10 years. The team, consisting of these two environment researchers and other volunteers, is expected to submit their report to the State government by the first week of April. “We expect that based on these findings and a survey report compiled by us, the government will take up conservation measures necessary to improve the status of the bird,” says Samad.



Several experts blame the Forest Department officials for their wrong policies and practices for the current situation of GIBs. Ranebennur Blackbuck Sanctuary in Haveri was declared as ‘home’ for both blackbucks and GIBs in 1974, because of its tailor-made grassland. It was an ideal breeding ground for the GIBs.



However, officials, after receiving funds from the government, turned this grassland area into a ‘forest’ by planting several trees, including eucalyptus, in the 119 sq kilometre protected area. As a result, the sprawling grasslands have vanished long ago and so have the GIBs.



With the change in landscape and habitat, the GIBs were ‘forced’ out of protected areas and into unfavourable territories. “These birds need arid and semi-arid grassland or countryside with thorny scrubs and tall grass for their survival,” explains Samad and adds that these birds avoid irrigated areas.



The GIBs are among the few birds that lay their eggs on the ground, thus making them susceptible to all kinds of threats. As these birds were moved out of their protected areas, their eggs were often destroyed by cattle grazing in the fields and by predators like jackal and fox. Due to these factors, hatching of GIB eggs became next to impossible and gradually, they ended up being pushed to the level of extinction.



While habitat loss is said to be one of the major reasons for the present status of the bird, unsuccessful breeding, accidental hunting by blackbuck hunters and excessive human activities in its breeding grounds are other reasons that have worsened the situation. Moreover, experts say that these birds don’t wish to give much work to their wings even when the threat is close to them.



“These birds play an important role in maintaining the balance of grassland ecology. In fact, they are farmers’ friends as they prey upon termites, grasshoppers, beetles and other insects that harm farm produce,” opines Indrajeet Ghorpade of Hagedal in Koppal, where GIBs were a common sight in the 1970s.



Not all hope is lost

Though the captured breeding experiment conducted by the forest officials in 1972 over a court order has failed to give the desired results, experts are still hopeful that the number of GIBs can be revived to a great extent. “All we need to do is give it back its grasslands. Remove those tall trees planted in Ranebennur Sanctuary and let the grass grow. We are sure that birds will return to their ‘home’,” says Santosh.



The team, along with this and other recommendations, has been requesting the State government to put in place surveillance and monitoring of the birds and most importantly, to confiscate illegal weapons from local people. “We have to learn from the mistakes committed at other sanctuaries like the Desert National Park in Jaisalmer of Rajasthan, where from hundreds of GIBs that were surveyed in 2011, the number has now come to just 13. Similarly, in the Nanaj Bird Sanctuary in Maharashtra, the bird count has decreased from 30 (in 2011) to three. For the last two decades, no one has spotted Great Indian Bustards in the Ranebennur Sanctuary and if immediate steps are not taken at the earliest, we will end up losing one of the rarest and beautiful bird species,” Santosh and Samad caution.

Few creatures are as gentle, harmless and beautiful as butterflies. They don’t chase, bite or sting you, and they cannot transmit diseases. I look at butterflies as winged flowers — radiant patches with golden freckles, lazily flying, fluttering, frolicking, basking in the sunshine. They are perfect examples of peace and tranquility.

Indeed, butterflies are insects of sunny days — “sun worshippers” that you seldom see on cloudy days. It’s almost as though the sun provides them with the power of flight.

Butterflies and moths come in such a variety of sizes and colors that many nature lovers record butterfly observations along with their bird watching. There’s even a book titled Butterflies through Binoculars — The East: A Field Guide to the Butterflies of Eastern North America by Jeffrey Glassberg.

One of the easiest butterflies to see flying is the brilliant yellow tiger swallowtail. I used to call it the eastern tiger swallowtail until I learned that our species is a cousin, called the Canadian. During some springs, it is the second large species that we see. The normal range of the eastern is the far southern and southwestern part of Wisconsin and most of the southeastern half of the United States.

The wingspan of the Canadian can be up to four inches, with females generally larger than males, and the eastern’s wingspan is five to five and a half inches. The black bands on the Canadian’s forewings are usually wider than those on the wings of the eastern swallowtail.

The Canadian tiger swallowtail has one brood per summer, and the eastern has two. You can see the Canadian in our area from mid-May to mid-July. Adults draw nectar from lilacs, blackberry blossoms, honeysuckle, wood lily, cherry blossoms, wild iris and Labrador tea, which grows in The Ridges Sanctuary. The larvae feed during the night on leaves of quaking aspen, birch trees and willows.

The black swallowtail has a wingspan of three and a half to four and a half inches. It can be seen in our area — but not as commonly as the yellow in some years — and can be confused with the black form of the eastern tiger swallowtail. Look for a twin row of yellow spots on both the fore and hind wings. Female black swallowtails have more blue on their hind wings. You can expect to see them flying over clover and alfalfa fields. Their striped larvae feast on plants in the carrot family, including carrot, dill, parsley and parsnip.

The spring of 2012 was exceptionally warm, with a few 80-degree days in March. That year my late husband, Roy, was photographing numerous butterflies nectaring on lilacs at Mud Bay in the Toft Point State Natural Area. It was on May 24 when he found a pipevine swallowtail, which is found in the Deep South and as far north as southern Illinois and Indiana. The extreme heat of that early spring apparently pushed them farther north than usual.

The undersides of the pipevine’s hind wings have broad, blue colors with strikingly large, orange spots. These contrasting colors against the purples and pinks of the lilacs were breathtaking. The caterpillars feed on noxious pipevines in the South, which makes the butterflies poisonous — or at least distasteful — to predators.

The rest of the large butterflies in our region belong to the brushfoot group, in the Nymphalidae family. There are about 5,000 species in the world and 220 in North America. The brushfoots get their name from their greatly reduced front legs, which are hidden by short hairs, making these creatures appear to have only four legs instead of the normal six.

The flashy, orange-and-brown great spangled fritillary butterfly is the largest of this widespread group. They are also called silver spots due to the pattern on the underside of their hind wings, and they have a wingspan of up to three and a half inches. You can see them flying over fields, roadsides, moist meadows and forest edges from late June to early September.

Monarchs, also brushfoots, have a wingspan of three and a half to four and a half inches. They are a migrating species that can arrive in Door County by early to mid-May. These fragile beauties have received much attention because their population has been declining greatly during the past few decades.

I saw my first mourning cloak butterfly on April 15 this year. It overwinters in our area and is one of the longest-living butterflies — up to 10 months or more. Its larvae feed on willows, elms, cottonwood and birches. Its dark-brown, three- to four-inch wings highlighted with a golden band at the outer edge make it easy to identify, and few butterflies are flying as early as this one!

The red-spotted purple-white admiral intergrade is really the southern subspecies of the red-spotted admiral and has been seen in Door County in August. We have the red admiral and the white admiral up here throughout the summer, but the true red-spotted purple is more common in southern Wisconsin. It does not have the red spots on the hind wings that the intergrade species has.

The white admiral butterfly has flashy, black wings with a broad, white stripe across each that forms a horseshoe when observed from the top. It can be seen from late May to early September. The caterpillar feeds on the leaves of birch, willow, aspen and cherry trees. The adults are unusual in that they don’t usually seek nectar from flowers but often get nutrients from bird droppings, aphid honey, mammal scat, puddles and wet sand.

Large moths with wingspans of three to six inches have become more rare in recent years. The three that we may see are the luna, cecropia and polyphemus, all of which belong to the giant silkworm family and the subfamily Saturniinae. These are related to the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, which the Chinese have raised to produce silk fabric starting around 2697 B.C.

The caterpillars of these large moths are thick and fleshy, with spines or bristle-clumps on raised tubercles. They feed on the leaves of birch, ash, beech, alder, grape, maple, oak and pine trees and members of the rose family. They form a cocoon, which is suspended from a tree branch or hidden in leaf litter on the ground.

Butterfly larvae form chrysalises, and moth caterpillars form cocoons. Some overwinter in that stage. Another difference is that the moths usually have pectinated (comblike) antennae, and butterflies have long, thin antennae with a small knob or swelling at the end.

Mourning cloaks are usually the first butterflies to be flying in spring. Photo by Charlotte Lukes.

Red spots on the hind wings help to identify this red-spotted purple-white admiral intergrade. Photo by Roy Lukes.

Cecropia and polyphemus moths have the greatest wingspan — six to seven inches — and the luna’s can reach more than four inches. Many moths are active at night, and they are especially attracted to outside lights left on. That’s how Roy was able to photograph several of these beauties in June 2012: An outside light had drawn the moths to rest on the side of a neighbor’s house.

Once you see the large, spectacular silkworm moths, you will never forget them. The cecropia has red, white and black bands around its plump body and fabulous colors and marks on its dark wings. The luna is a delicate green, with a small eyespot on each wing and long, swallowtail-like extensions on its hind wings. The polyphemus is a soft, medium brown, with a large, single eyespot on the hind wing that almost looks like that of an animal.

We can help sustain the lives of these wonderful, winged creatures by avoiding pesticide use and encouraging native plantings. Though light and delicate, butterflies and moths are powerful reminders of how fragile our planet is. Learn more about them, protect them and enjoy them to the fullest!

BILLINGS, Mont. — Scientists tasked with reviewing government plans to lift protections for gray wolves across most of the U.S. said in a report released Friday that the proposal has numerous factual errors and other problems.

The five-member scientific panel’s conclusions were detailed in a 245-page report delivered to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

One reviewer said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service appeared to have come to a pre-determined conclusion, not supported by its own science, that wolves should come off the endangered species list.

“It looks like they decided to delist and then they compiled all the evidence that they thought supported that decision. It simply doesn’t support the decision,” said Adrian Treves, an environmental studies professor at the University of Wisconsin.

MORE: Colorado wildlife officials are reluctant to OK gray wolf reintroduction. So advocates want voters to do it.

Treves said a chief concern is poaching: Without protections, illegal killings of wolves could rise, he said.

The findings could undercut the government’s contention that gray wolves across the Lower 48 have recovered from near extermination.

Federal officials have been under increasing pressure to put wolves under state management, which is already the case in parts of the Northern Rockies where hunting and trapping of the animals is allowed.

Prohibitions on hunting elsewhere have fueled resentment against wolves among livestock owners who must deal with attacks by the predators. Also, some hunters see wolves as competition for big game animals.

After being nearly wiped out in the Lower 48 early last century, more than 6,000 gray wolves now live in portions of nine states. The decades-long, government-sponsored recovery effort for the animals has cost roughly $160 million.

Yet gray wolves remain absent from most of their historical range. Critics of lifting protections say the move would be premature and worry that more hunting will reverse the species’ rebound.

Wildlife service spokeswoman Vanessa Kauffman said officials were still going over the scientific report and had no immediate response.

Members of the review panel questioned the agency’s treatment of a basic issue: whether gray wolves in the Lower 48 states are biologically the same or consist of more than one species.

Daniel MacNulty, an associate professor at Utah State University, said the proposed rule had “demonstrable errors of fact, interpretation, and logic” and its description of where wolves presently range is fuzzy.

Five years ago, a similar report helped convince federal officials to temporarily shelve plans to lift wolf protections. That report, too, questioned the science used by federal officials.

Flesher reported from Traverse City, Michigan.

As millions of people celebrate the environmental movement and promote conservation on Earth Day, we look at Queensland’s three biodiversity hotspots that need our help.

1. The Border Ranges, southeast Queesnland

This sub-tropical and temperate hotspot that runs across the border of southern Queensland and northern New South Wales is one of Australia’s most diverse areas.

media_camera A spotted-tail quoll. Pic: Stewart McLean.

Its wide variety of habitats include subtropical rainforest, mountain headlands and rocky outcrops and support many rare and threatened species such as the Spotted-tailed Quoll and the Long-nosed Potoroo.

Primitive plant species similar to fossils from the ancient subcontinent Gondwana also live in the southeast Queensland section of the rainforest.

The region is under threat from high human population growth that has resulted in habitat destruction and fragmentation.

Most of the remaining areas are under protection, however weeds, fire and recreational use continue to pose a significant threat.

2. The Brigalow Belt, southeast Queensland

This biodiversity hotspot on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range has the only remaining wild population of the endangered Northern Hairy-nosed Wombat.

It was estimated in 2013 that there are fewer than 230 Northern Hair-nosed Wombats left on the planet.

The Brigalow Belt is also an important habitat for other rare and threatened species including the Jewel Butterfly, the Bridled Nail-tail Wallaby and the Glossy Black-Cockatoo.

The original vegetation has been fragmented by broad-scale clearing for agriculture and unsustainable grazing.

Feral animals, particularly pigs, cats, and foxes, also pose a huge threat to native wildlife.

3. The Einasleigh and Desert Uplands, Northern Queensland

Queensland’s third biodiversity hotspot, the Einasleigh and Desert Uplands is a stunning landscape of contrasts.

The plains and low ranges of the Desert Uplands are home to 22 rare or threatened species of animals, including the Julia Creek Dunnart, and 29 rare or threatened species of plants.

The cubs came from a female that was involved in a surprise encounter with a hiker near Dupuyer. The female was euthanized on April 9 by FWP staff after she was shot and injured by the hiker. The hiker's injuries were not life-threatening. At the time, it wasn’t clear how many cubs she had, though it was thought she had at least one.

Three days later, a ranching family spotted three cubs huddled together in a nearby field and called FWP to report the cubs. While waiting for FWP staff to arrive, the family grew concerned for the cubs’ safety because of a male grizzly that lives in the area and because of an impending snowstorm. The ranching family was able to gently rope the cubs and keep them in one area. A nearby rancher offered a barrel in which they placed the cubs. When FWP staff arrived, they took the cubs to the FWP wildlife center (Montana Wild) in Helena.

The cubs have been at Montana Wild for a little more than six weeks while FWP staff searched for a zoo that meets rigorous, scientifically-based standards. The standards address the following areas:

Exceptional animal care and welfare, including trained staff

Veterinary care

Safety for the public, staff, and the animals

Proper enclosures that can keep wildlife safely contained, allow for adequate space, include habitat features, and enrichment items for mental stimulation

Educating the public on conservation

Financial stability

FWP ultimately decided to relocated the cubs to Bearizona Wildlife Park, which is located in northern Arizona west of Flagstaff.

The park covers more than 160 acres and is accredited by the Zoological Association of America. Bearizona is home to 39 black bears and many other species of North American wildlife, including bison, burros, wolves, and elk.

There will be FWP Live Facebook Event featuring the cubs on Thursday, May 28.



(APRIL 21, 2020) The Wildlife Rehabilitation Center at Montana WILD in Helena has three new grizzly bear cubs under their care.

The orphaned cubs were found by a ranching family near Dupuyer on the Rocky Mountain Front three days after their mother was shot by a hiker and had to be euthanized by Montana Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP).

The ranchers contacted FWP and helped wrangle the three cubs so they could be taken to Helena. FWP staff gave them a medical examination and found the cubs were in good condition, although a little dehydrated. “Compared to other cubs we had gotten in, they were doing pretty well,” said Laurie Wolf, FWP Interim Education Bureau Chief. Wolf says dehydration is common for orphaned bear cubs brought to Montana WILD, and it’s important to get the right type of food into their system.

When black bear cubs come into the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, staff take every measure to limit human interaction and make sure they stay wild for eventual release back into the wild.“We’re not hand feeding, we’re not talking to these animals,” said Wolf. “We want to set them up for the best chance for success once we release them.”

The grizzly cubs, on the other hand, will not be released back into the wild. FWP says there it’s not clear yet on the risks a rehabilitated grizzly might have on people, livestock, or property. There also just isn’t the staff or infrastructure for a grizzly release program.

FWP is currently looking for an accredited facility that will take the cubs after their time at Montana WILD. Fewer than 10% of animal exhibitors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture are accredited.

 Philippine Eagle;Pithecophaga jefferyi;Philippines;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Falconiformes;Accipitridae;Pithecophaga;jefferyi;I;Philippines;;"Philippine eagle hatchling was born at the Philippine Eagle Foundation’s (PEF) conservation center on December 7.

This is the twenty sixth eaglet born at the center in 23 years, and the first offspring of a female named Go Phoenix and a male named MVP Eagle.

The eaglet will become a part of PEF’s breeding program, and will be as part of the captive gene pool.

On December 7, a tiny Philippine eagle hatchling was born at the Philippine Eagle Foundation’s (PEF) conservation center in the Philippines. This is the twenty sixth eaglet born at the center in 23 years, and the first offspring of a female named Go Phoenix and a male named MVP Eagle.

“This hatching is a big breakthrough for us and is the result of nearly five years of round robin pairing amongst our younger set of eagles at the center,” PEF Executive Director Dennis Salvador said in a statement. “We are proud of our conservation breeding team for their perseverance at this very challenging task.”

One of the largest eagles in the world, the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is critically endangered and has only around 500 individuals remaining in the wild. Breeding these birds in captivity is a challenge.

“Our greatest challenge has been working on birds that need to be rehabilitated first before they are conditioned for captive breeding,” PEF Curator Anna Mae Sumaya told Mongabay. “Many of these birds have either been shot or trapped with unclear histories as they were admitted into the Center.”

Sumaya added that the captive breeding program works with only four eagle pairs, and successful breeding requires the right amount of conditioning and intervention. The recently hatched eaglet is doing well, she said.

Of the 26 eagles born in captivity at the center, PEF has released three into the wild. However, one of the released eagles died due to electrocution, and another was shot and killed.

“The third one was able to venture away from the release site, following riparian forest for a year,” Sumaya said. “However, the eagle frequented communities near this habitat and was occasionally observed preying on their livestock, thus was brought back to the Center.”

The recently born chick will become a part of PEF’s breeding program, and will be as part of the captive gene pool, she added. The Philippine eagle center houses 34 Philippine eagles in total.

A group of fountain pen enthusiasts, called the Fountain Pen Network, has donated Philippine Peso 50,000 (~$1,000) to the eagle center to help with the “baby eagle’s initial needs until someone decides to adopt the eaglet.”";"Rare Philippine eagle chick born in captivity; boosts hope for the species";https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxNS8xMi9yYXJlLXBoaWxpcHBpbmUtZWFnbGUtY2hpY2stYm9ybi1pbi1jYXB0aXZpdHktYm9vc3RzLWhvcGUtZm9yLXRoZS1zcGVjaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2015/12/02233034/Chick26-PEF-file-122015-495x330.jpg;2015-12-18;[{'sent': 'Philippine eagle hatchling was born at the Philippine Eagle Foundation’s (PEF) conservation center on December 7.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Philippine Eagle Foundation']}}, {'sent': 'This is the twenty sixth eaglet born at the center in 23 years, and the first offspring of a female named Go Phoenix and a male named MVP Eagle.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Go Phoenix'], 'ORG': ['MVP Eagle']}}, {'sent': 'The eaglet will become a part of PEF’s breeding program, and will be as part of the captive gene pool.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PEF']}}, {'sent': 'On December 7, a tiny Philippine eagle hatchling was born at the Philippine Eagle Foundation’s (PEF) conservation center in the Philippines.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Philippine Eagle Foundation'], 'GPE': ['Philippines']}}, {'sent': 'This is the twenty sixth eaglet born at the center in 23 years, and the first offspring of a female named Go Phoenix and a male named MVP Eagle.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Go Phoenix'], 'ORG': ['MVP Eagle']}}, {'sent': '“This hatching is a big breakthrough for us and is the result of nearly five years of round robin pairing amongst our younger set of eagles at the center,” PEF Executive Director Dennis Salvador said in a statement.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PEF'], 'PERSON': ['Dennis Salvador']}}, {'sent': 'One of the largest eagles in the world, the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is critically endangered and has only around 500 individuals remaining in the wild.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['only around 500', 'One'], 'ORG': ['Pithecophaga']}}, {'sent': '“Our greatest challenge has been working on birds that need to be rehabilitated first before they are conditioned for captive breeding,” PEF Curator Anna Mae Sumaya told Mongabay.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Mongabay', 'PEF Curator'], 'PERSON': ['Anna Mae Sumaya']}}, {'sent': 'Sumaya added that the captive breeding program works with only four eagle pairs, and successful breeding requires the right amount of conditioning and intervention.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['eagle', 'Sumaya'], 'CARDINAL': ['only four']}}, {'sent': 'Of the 26 eagles born in captivity at the center, PEF has released three into the wild.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['three', '26'], 'ORG': ['PEF']}}, {'sent': 'However, one of the released eagles died due to electrocution, and another was shot and killed.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': '“The third one was able to venture away from the release site, following riparian forest for a year,” Sumaya said.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Sumaya']}}, {'sent': 'The recently born chick will become a part of PEF’s breeding program, and will be as part of the captive gene pool, she added.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PEF']}}, {'sent': 'The Philippine eagle center houses 34 Philippine eagles in total.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['34']}}, {'sent': 'A group of fountain pen enthusiasts, called the Fountain Pen Network, has donated Philippine Peso 50,000 (~$1,000) to the eagle center to help with the “baby eagle’s initial needs until someone decides to adopt the eaglet.”', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['50,000']}}];Positive
 Eld's Deer;Rucervus eldii;Cambodia, China, India, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam;EN;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Artiodactyla;Cervidae;Rucervus;eldii;I;Cambodia,China,India,Lao People's Democratic Republic,Myanmar;;"A satellite population could be the turning point for the species, experts aver. “The single population is highly vulnerable due to homozygous nature with low genetic variability (inbreeding depression), disease susceptibility (immune system is compromised), fertility related issues (reduced fertility),” conservation geneticist Ajay Gaur told Mongabay-India.

To aid conservation of the endemic Manipur subspecies, Gaur and colleagues associated with the Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species (LaCONES) of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), decoded the sangai’s mitochondrial DNA. The mitochondrial DNA sequence tells us that though the sangai had a common ancestor, it is genetically distinct from other subspecies owing to its geographic isolation, Gaur explained.

He agreed that relocating and maintaining a satellite population is a wise idea. “You should not put all eggs in a single basket. Any infection or disease outbreak may wipe off the whole population. Under the present competition with hog deer and park reaching its carrying capacity, it will be advisable to have an alternative place to keep these animals and relocate as and when required,” Gaur said.

Further, he said, the population present in zoos would be genetically uniform with no or very low variability or totally inbred and certainly at risk of endangerment.

But proposals pitching relocation to an alternative site (harbouring floating biomass) have hit a roadblock over protests by local community members apprehending livelihood challenges.

One of the alternative sites identified by Wildlife Institute of India as suitable is Pumlen Pat and adjoining Thongam Mondum Reserve Forest, a 63 square of wetland and hillocks in Thoubal district of the state. Pumlen Pat is a fresh-water lake second largest in the state after Loktak Lake. The matter was discussed in the sixth meeting of the State Board for Wildlife in May 2017.

“Pumlen Pat was identified as the most suitable site for the establishment of this population due to similar habitat features with the Keibul Lamjao National Park. ,” said WII project scientist Chongpi Tuboi, who works on sangai conservation.

Discussions focused on developing Pumlen Pat as the second home of sangai, sustainable development of the area and that conservation breeding of sangai should be initiated using modern techniques at the Keibul Lamjao National Park, she said.

She said a section of local communities are under the assumption that if Pumlen Pat is converted to a conservation reserve for the sangai then they would be barred from entering the lake and this would affect their livelihood (mainly fish farming). This is not true, she maintained.

Tuboi remarked that the aim is not only to find a second home for the sangai but also for the sustainable development of the area through various means such as ecotourism, but there should be something for the tourists to see.

“We need to get the area declared as a conservation reserve. We can not carry out livelihood interventions for the local communities without reintroduction of sangai. Value addition needs to be done to Pumlen Pat in terms of sangai which will attract national and international tourists to see the sangai conservation success,” she said.

Creation of conservation reserve does not curtail the rights of the local communities, asserted Tuboi, adding that it allows them to use the area as before but with restriction so as to maintain the sustainability of the resources. The communities are open to sustainable development of the area but are extremely worried about their livelihood, she said. “So we are trying to explain to them the difference between a reserve and national park,” Tuboi noted.

That is why we are advocating reintroduction of sangai in the area, she stressed. This will make the area available for sustainable use and not be encroached or degraded.

“If you look at Pumlen Pat scientifically, then we see it is in a highly degraded condition. If there is no scientific intervention in Pumlen Pat are going to over exploit the resources and degraded it further in the near future. Hence, our plan is to conserve the Pumlen lake but in the name of sangai as we will use only a small portion of the lake, and not the entire lake, as people believe,” she said.

Acknowledging the concerns, chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Anurag Bajpai emphasised on preserving the interests and rights of the community before taking any steps. “We have to look into people’s interest because this area is not under the forest department.

Pink-headed Duck;Rhodonessa caryophyllacea;Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Anseriformes;Anatidae;Rhodonessa;caryophyllacea;I;;Bangladesh,India,Nepal;"More than a century ago, in the wetlands around Kolkata, India, there lived a shy type of duck with a bright pink head. It was named, appropriately, the pink-headed duck. The males of the species had rosy pink bills and pink plumage covering their heads and necks. Some of them had light, blush-colored feathers; others were as bright as Pepto-Bismol. They were never particularly common, but hunters spotted them and on occasion bagged them while hunting bigger game. One of the last times anyone saw a pink-headed duck in the wild, it was in the mouth of a hunting dog, who delivered its carcass to Charles M. Inglis, curator of the Darjeeling museum, outside the Indian city of Darbhanga in June 1935.

Officially, the pink-headed duck is listed as critically endangered. The last confirmed sighting in the wild was in 1949. Though there have been reports of pink-headed ducks here and there in the decades since, many people now believe the birds are not just rare and shy, but extinct.

Richard Thorns is not among them. For years now, he has been searching for the pink-headed duck, and, since 2009, he has traveled six times to Myanmar, where he believes a flock of about 50 birds might live. Thorns, an enthusiastic, 53-year-old Englishman whose look can range from scholarly nerd to rugged adventurer, first learned about the pink-headed duck around 1997, from a library book on vanishing birds. At the time, he was working as a shop assistant. As he read about these stunning, rare birds, and the elephant grasses and lotus flowers that they lived among, he had a realization. “I didn’t want to be a shop assistant anymore,” he says. “I decided to look for the pink-headed duck. So I did, and I’ve been after it ever since.”

From his journeys in Myanmar, Thorns has developed a theory about exactly where the pink-headed duck could be hiding, and this fall he plans to return for a seventh search, as part of the Search for Lost Species. The campaign, created by Austin-based nonprofit Global Wildlife Conservation, will attempt to relocate a handful of more than 1,200 species considered “lost to science”—long unseen, unrecorded, and feared extinct. A century ago, pink-headed ducks could be found in Myanmar, and Thorns believes that it’s very possible the ducks are living there still, in parts of the country long closed to outsiders, out of sight of birdwatchers and conservation organizations.

To some, there’s little point in a quixotic search for a lost duck. These birds supposed to be extinct, after all. “The people who hope for the pink-headed duck are people prepared to think in a different way,” Thorns says. “It’s like a detective story. Have we just missed it? Or is it hidden where no one can go?”

Thorns is not the first to go looking for the elusive waterfowl. In the 1980s, Rory Nugent, an American adventurer and writer, heard about the duck from a friend. By two months later, he had sold his apartment, had put his belongings in storage, and was on his way to India. Like Thorns, Nugent believed he could find the duck in a part of the world troubled by violent conflict and usually off-limits. He waited for months for permission to travel the Brahmaputra River in Assam, which he spent searching for the duck in the bird markets of Kolkata (then still called Calcutta), in the towns of Sikkim, and on the border of India and Tibet. Finally, he and Shankar Barua, an artist and photographer whom he met in New Delhi, set out down the Brahmaputra and scoured the river for weeks. He never got a clear glimpse of his quarry, but by the end of the journey Nugent insisted, “We’ve seen it. We just didn’t notice it. … They’re not extinct, just hard to find.” His book about the adventure ends with a reported sighting and the author heading back upriver.

Part of the mystery surrounding the pink-headed duck is why it disappeared to begin with. Most species are driven to extinction by habitat loss, hunting, or predation by an invasive species, but there’s no obvious cause for the pink-headed duck’s disappearance. Though its habitat has diminished and it was hunted, other birds have survived the same circumstances. Since the pink-headed duck was always relatively rare, it is possible to imagine the bird is still hiding somewhere out there. Nugent’s report, another from Myanmar in 1968, and other more recent sightings are not considered robust enough to count as evidence for the duck’s continued survival. But stories of pink-headed duck sightings keep popping up, and some of the most recent come from the exact area of Myanmar where Thorns has been searching.

In 1910, a pink-headed duck, now stuffed and held at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, turned up at a bazaar in Mandalay, one of the country’s largest cities. Since then, unconfirmed reports of the ducks have come from the country’s northern districts. In the early 2000s, two conservation groups—BirdLife International and Myanmar’s Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association (BANCA)—began surveying rivers, lakes, and wetlands in the region for pink-headed ducks.

In December 2004, the team was in the Nawng Kwin wetlands, north of vast Indawgyi Lake, when they met a young man named Saw Aung, who said he was familiar with the duck. One morning, the group went out into the grasslands, and Saw Aung flushed a flock of ducks from a wetland pool. A few dozen mallards rose into the air, and as three foreign birdwatchers peered through telescopes, one duck “broke off from the flock, climbed quite high, circled for 2 to 3 minutes, and then descended into the grassland,” the team later wrote in a published report. The three men agreed: The bird, medium-sized, had a pale head and neck, a dark body, and dark upper wings. It looked a lot like a pink-headed duck.

In that part of the world, though, there is another bird with similar features, the spot-billed duck. The men discussed the features that would distinguish one bird from another—in particular, white feathers on the underside of the wing, a characteristic of the spot-billed duck. Had they seen those feathers? One of the three observers thought he had. Though another thought it was “very likely” they had seen a pink-headed duck, the other two weren’t so sure. They couldn’t rule out the possibility that they’d seen a variety of spot-billed duck. “On balance, therefore, this record should be treated as a possible but unconfirmed sighting of Pink-headed Duck,” they wrote. The thrilling moment had passed too quickly for any semblance of certainty.

Before beginning his search, Thorns was not a serious birder. “My brother is the person to talk to there,” he says. “He is a real hotshot birder.” But once he heard of the pink-headed duck, he never forgot about the bird, its beauty, and the beauty of its habitat. “I inherited my grandfather’s instincts as an explorer,” he says. “I think a lot of it was … I wasn’t doing very much. I didn’t really feel fulfilled. The pink-headed duck is like some sort of mythical thing. It is so iconic and beautiful.” The idea of finding something missing for so many years gave him a mission.

In his first visits to Myanmar, Thorns tried to keep himself and his purpose as well concealed as the fowl he was searching for. Before 2011, the country was still ruled by the military junta that had been in power since 1962, and even today the government restricts the movements of foreign travelers in certain parts of the country. Myanmar is rich in jade, gold, and other treasures. Some of the most resource-rich areas are off-limits, and in the north ethnic independence armies are still in conflict with government forces. But for pink-headed duck seekers, those same areas are some of the most promising targets, full of marshy, undeveloped, restricted habitat. To find the duck, Thorns figured he would need to sneak into places he technically was not supposed to be.

Thorns made his way north to visit towns on the Ayeyarwady River, following historic reports, and to Indawgyi Lake, where the 2004 expedition made its possible sighting. In Bhamo, he sought out a man named Sein Win. Thorns had read in a Lonely Planet guide that this man was locally famous for having built his own helicopter. “I figured that if he was eccentric enough to have built a helicopter, he might not be too averse to being my guide,” Thorns says. They snuck farther upriver than the government allowed, but they did not go unnoticed. One time they had to wait on the boat until night fell to sneak downriver, hide in a temple, and pretend they were coming back into town from the south. Another time, Thorns traveled to a promising lake only to find it was on the wrong, off-limits side of the river. He had to offer a boatman “a million kyat”—hundreds of dollars—to take him across.

All that risk-taking had an impact. On his third trip, in 2012, the conflict in the country’s north had heated up, and sneaking upriver on a boat was no longer an option. So Thorns rented a bicycle and tried to pedal out of town. “Looking back at it now, it was a mad thing to do,” he says. On the small road, two kids roared by on a motorbike, and as Thorns fell, his hand collided with their vehicle. A well-meaning woman brought him ointment, but he knew the hand was broken. Even today he can’t open it properly.

That year Thorns spent part of his trip relaxing on the beach and in Mandalay’s public baths, but it was a breakthrough of sorts. He had first learned about the pink-headed duck in his early 30s, and he was then in his late 40s. He had worked for more than a decade as a driver, mostly for a local hospital, and never had much money. Financing the trips required single-minded purpose—between each he worked as much as possible to pay off debts from the previous one and save for the next. It’s been a very long time, he says, since he’s had girlfriend. Though he had some financial help from an anonymous backer, over the years, he estimates he has spent £12,000—the equivalent of $15,000 at today’s exchange rate—of his own money on his fruitless search. It wasn’t wise, but it was worth it, he believed. If he could find the pink-headed duck, he could change history. But he needed to change his strategy. He resolved to stop sneaking around and embrace the authorities.

Through BANCA, Thorns built relationships with guides and travel agencies to help him get permits to travel to the more remote places on his list of potential pink-headed duck hotspots. On his most recent trip, in 2016, he had an experience that convinced him he might be getting closer. On his last day in the field, he was in a village where he’d been in 2010. Thorns and his guide were showing their bird book to locals, and one man came into the café. He pointed to the pink-headed duck and said that the bird was very rare.

“Has he ever seen it?” Thorns asked, through the guide and interpreter, Lay Win.

No, he hadn’t, the man replied. Thorns probed further. Had he never seen it at all?

Oh, he had seen it elsewhere, the man said. It was five or six years ago … up in the wetlands.

“I was there in 2010; I was just asking the wrong person in the village,” says Thorns. “He said that it was very rare and extremely shy. You can only find it in a certain part of the wetlands.”

That night, Thorns and his guide were sitting by the water, having a beer. Thorns asked the guide, whom he describes as “very cautious guy,” if he thought the man had really seen the duck.

“Yes,” he said. “I think he did see it.”

After consulting with BANCA, Thorns now believes that the pink-headed duck may visit that area in the wet season before migrating elsewhere, to a valley where outsiders are not allowed, for the rest of the year. “The people who were reporting the pink-headed duck were not tourists or birders,” he says. “They were hunters, travelers, farmers. They’re all people who have no choice but to go into a swamp in the rainy season.” He now plans to return to Myanmar this fall, starting in the last week of October, when traveling the country is “like being in a washing machine,” to continue the search. He is working with Global Wildlife Conservation to fund the trip, but his team is also raising funds on its own. This time, Thorns also plans to hire an elephant to help flush the birds out and increase the chance that the pink-headed duck will briefly reveal itself.

If Thorns and his companions on this next journey, naturalist and writer Errol Fuller, photographer John Hodges, and Hodges’s partner, Pilar Bueno, do make a sighting, they may need to keep the exact location secret. “I can’t emphasize enough how sought after a pink-headed duck head would be,” Thorns says. “You have to be very, very careful.”

In fact, it’s possible that a European birdwatcher has already seen the duck in the same area Thorns will search. When Thorns visited the area the first time, he was told about a Dutch man who came each year, for five years, and hired an elephant, in search of the pink-headed duck. On his fifth visit, he came back from the wetland triumphant—he was sure he had seen the bird, he told locals, but had not managed to take a picture.

“You don’t know how you will behave” upon finding the duck, says Thorns. “I remember once finding an opal in this old abandoned heap of junk. There was a dividing line—I went from not having an opal to having an opal in my pocket. But these things happen. It’s hard to know how you’re going to react.” If all goes well, it will be the same scenario. One minute, no one will have definitively seen the duck for decades. The next, Thorns will have conclusively identified, photographed, and rediscovered the pink-headed duck. Known again to science. No longer lost.

“If anyone is going to find the pink-headed duck,” he says, “I want it to be me.”";In Search of the Elusive Pink-Headed Duck;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0bGFzb2JzY3VyYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvcGluay1oZWFkZWQtZHVjay1zZWFyY2gtbG9zdC1zcGVjaWVzLWV4dGluY3TSAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdGxhc29ic2N1cmEuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL3BpbmstaGVhZGVkLWR1Y2stc2VhcmNoLWxvc3Qtc3BlY2llcy1leHRpbmN0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzLzc5YmJmNzk4NGRlNWMxMTI1ZF92MS5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/v1.jpg;2017-06-01;"[{'sent': 'More than a century ago, in the wetlands around Kolkata, India, there lived a shy type of duck with a bright pink head.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Kolkata', 'India']}}, {'sent': 'Some of them had light, blush-colored feathers; others were as bright as Pepto-Bismol.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Pepto-Bismol']}}, {'sent': 'One of the last times anyone saw a pink-headed duck in the wild, it was in the mouth of a hunting dog, who delivered its carcass to Charles M.

You’ll use the meat you gather to keep your cores full and your camp fed, and to craft some stat-buffing talismans. And you’ll need to do a lot of hunting to complete the Master Hunter Challenges (obviously).

Like a lot of Red Dead Redemption 2, though, hunting is only briefly explained in the game. There’s a lot of nuance, and many things to keep track of, if you want to be an efficient hunter. This guide will walk through hunting starting with the basics, then moving on to animal quality and using the right weapon, and then we’ll talk about what to do with animals once you’ve killed them. We’ll wrap it up with a case study of hunting to earn the Master Hunter Challenge 2.

Hunting basics — finding, studying and tracking animals

We’re going to break everything down in much more detail below, but you already know the basics of hunting: Shoot an animal until it stops running away. Not understanding the nuances of the hunting mechanic can make it a frustrating, low-yield endeavor, so it’s worth some time to talk about it.

Finding animals

Red Dead Redemption 2’s America is full of animals. There are 178 kinds to discover, in fact (though this number includes males and females of some species), so you’re almost always near something. The problem is how they all seem to disappear when you’re after something specific.

The easiest way to find animals is to just ride your horse or walk around, and look for them. That may sound overly simple, but it’s a good way to start any hunt and, we’ve found, it’s as (or more) effective than some of the other ways to find animals. Arthur will also draw a picture of animals on his (your) map when he encounters them, and you can use those as general starting points for a hunt.

Next come your binoculars. These do two things for you on a hunt:

They’re a good way to study an animal without getting too close — you just have to have a good line of sight on it, and have to keep it centered in view for a few seconds. You can also trick your binoculars into pointing out animals you can’t quite see. As you scan the landscape, watch for the “study” prompt to appear in the bottom right of your screen. This means you’re looking at an animal (whether or not you can see it is a different question). If you’ve studied the animal, you’ll even be able to tell what you’re (not) looking at.

The most powerful tool you have to find animals is your Eagle Eye ability. There’s a lot going on here (that we’ll discuss more below), but the biggest help is that it brightly highlights any animals you can see.

Studying animals

Studying animals adds them — and more importantly, information about them — to your Compendium. When you study an animal, you’ll get a blurb of information about it, including the best weapon to use (even if that’s not always perfect — see below).

There are three ways to study an animal:

For domesticated, docile or just slow animals, you can simply walk up and hold down L2/LT to focus on it, then hold down R1/RB. For animals that you can’t or don’t want to approach, you can study them through your binoculars with R1/RB — or pull out a gun, and use lock-on targeting to keep a creature in your sights long enough to study it. Finally, there’s the nuclear option: shoot it and skin it. If you shoot and skin (or just collect) an animal, it’ll get added to your Compendium as if you studied it.

Once an animal has been added to your Compendium, you’ll be able to identify it (and its pelt quality — more on this below) through your binoculars, while targeting with or without a weapon equipped, and while in Eagle Eye.

Tracking animals

While using Eagle Eye, you’ll not only see animals highlighted if you’re close enough, but you’ll also see trails of where animals have been. If you’ve studied the animals, you’ll be able to see what kind of animal it is and its pelt quality.

If you’re looking for just any old animal to put a bullet into, you can pick whatever track you want and start following. If you’re looking to be efficient (find a perfect-quality animal) or looking for a particular animal, this is your opportunity to improve your chances.

Shooting animals

Very broadly speaking, this is the easiest to understand: You pull out a weapon, and you shoot until the animal you’re shooting at is dead. There are a couple of nuances, and we’ll talk about why you should use specific guns for specific animals below.

As you probably expect, headshots (or neckshots) deal more damage than body shots. Whenever possible, aim for the head.

Sometimes, your prey is facing away from you or has its head down in the grass, and you just can’t get a good shot. While aiming at an animal, press square/X to call out to it. Most of the time, it will lift its head momentarily, giving you a great chance for a headshot. Just don’t call out too often, or you’ll scare it off.

Performance-enhancing substances (baits and lotion)

There are three things you can buy or craft that will help you in hunting: Herbivore Bait, Predator Bait and Cover Scent Lotion.

The baits work as you’d expect: They draw nearby animals to a location of your choosing. Ideally, you’ll put them somewhere with not much ground cover and some high ground nearby that you can watch from. In our experience, though, baits (specifically Herbivore Bait) just aren’t worth the time. You don’t have control over what comes to check it out — it could be the buck you’ve been stalking, or it could be a chipmunk — and it’s just a lot of waiting.

Cover Scent Lotion masks your scent from animals. You can see your scent (and which direction it’s blowing in) while you’re in Eagle Eye. The blueish stink lines coming off Arthur are your scent, and the direction they’re blowing indicates wind direction.

You’ll buy these items in General Stores, or you can craft them on your own at a campfire.

Animal (and pelt) quality

Once you’ve studied an animal, you’ll be able to see its quality when you’re looking at it through your binoculars or aiming at it with a weapon. The quality that you see next to the animal’s name in the lower right corner is the animal’s base quality. It’ll never get better than that, no matter how well you shoot it. Animals (and pelts) have three possible qualities: ★ (poor), ★★ (good) or ★★★ (perfect).

Quality matters for a few reasons:

Perfect carcasses and pelts earn you a lot more money than poor ones do when you turn them in at a butcher.

If you’re butchering (skinning) the animal instead, perfect-quality animals earn you more items (like meat or feathers) than poor ones.

This means that if you want to be efficient, you want to go for perfect animals and perfect kills every (or most of the) time.

Pick the best weapon for each animal

The base quality of the animal is where its carcass and pelt quality starts, but it can go down depending on how you kill it. It makes sense: If you shoot a squirrel with a shotgun, the pelt isn’t exactly going to be pristine.

To make sure you get perfect pelts, you have to use the right weapon. And the right weapon depends on the size of the animal. There are five sizes of animal in Red Dead Redemption 2: small, moderate, medium, large and massive. The quick way to know which animals are in which category is by what Arthur does with them when he picks up or stows their carcass. Small animals go straight into his satchel, moderate animals get skinned without a knife (ew) or tied to his saddle on the sides, medium and large animals require a knife to skin and get stowed on the back of his horse, and massive animals can only be butchered — Arthur can’t even carry them to his horse.

Once you know what size animal you’re dealing with, you can choose the right weapon to get your perfect kill. Bear (heh) in mind that your prey will only remain perfect if you get a fatal shot (like a headshot). Each animal size category has (at least) one weapon you need to use if you’re trying to get a perfect pelt:

For small animals like squirrels and frogs, you’ll need a bow with small game arrows . You can craft these arrows from a flight feather, an arrow and a shotgun shell. (You can harvest flight feathers from birds you shoot.)

Moderate animals, like rabbits and geese, need to be killed with the varmint rifle , which you can buy at a gunsmith.

As you’d expect, large animals are a little harder to kill. You can take them down with bows (especially with poison arrows), rifles and sniper rifles. For these, a rifle is the easiest.

For medium and large animals, you have one other option: your lasso. Select it out of your weapon wheel, target the animal normally, then hold down R2/RT while you subdue the animal. Keep the trigger held down while you get off your horse and approach, then you’ll get a prompt to kill the animal cleanly.

What to do with your kills

So: You’ve found, tracked, killed, carried and skinned (or some combination thereof) an animal. Now what? You’ve got a few options for what to do with the animals you’ve killed — or, more specifically, their parts.

Eat . You can turn the animals you’ve killed into provisions by cooking (crafting) them at a campfire.

. You can turn the animals you’ve killed into provisions by cooking (crafting) them at a campfire. Sell . If you take your kills to a butcher (which you can find in most towns), you can turn your kills into cash. Several things factor into the payout. Carcasses are worth more than pelts, perfect quality is worth more than poor quality, and animals that are rare in the region are worth more (e.g., moose in Saint Denis).

You can also donate all of your animal parts to Pearson’s butcher table in camp. The meats get turned into provisions to feed the camp, while you can use the pelts and other parts for various camp and satchel upgrades.

After you complete Hosea’s “The Spines of America” mission during Chapter 2, you’ll be able to visit fences in certain towns. These less-than-reputable shopkeepers will craft you various trinkets and talismans out of animal parts. These items give a boost to one of your stats.

Case study: Master Hunter Challenge 2

After you’ve killed and skinned three deer (which is easy enough, since you don’t have to worry about their quality) and completed Master Hunter Challenge 1, you’ll move on to the second one. You might expect that the second level wouldn’t be too difficult (and it’s ultimately not), but we sure struggled with it.

The second Master Hunter Challenge asks you to collect three perfect-quality rabbit pelts. As you can see from all that we wrote above, a lot goes into such a simple task.

Start with the right gun

Despite the game and your Compendium telling you to use your bow on rabbits, the only way to get a perfect rabbit pelt is to use a varmint rifle. One can be picked up at any gunsmith — and make sure you’ve got ammo for it while you’re there.

Finding rabbits

You can find rabbits pretty much anywhere in the game world (except, it may seem, when you’re looking for them). Use the icons Arthur draws on his map to get you to places you’ve seen them before or, if you have a good memory, just go to one of those places. We had a lot of luck south of Valentine, just northeast of the Horseshoe Overlook campsite.

Getting perfect pelts

First, make sure you’re using your varmint rifle. Next, using your binoculars and Eagle Eye, make sure you’re looking at or tracking only perfect (three-star) rabbits. Finally, make sure you’re stocked up on Dead Eye tonics (like chewing tobacco).

Wander around the likely area on foot, checking with both Eagle Eye and your binoculars often. Once you find a trail, use your Eagle Eye and start following it. Move slowly — don’t crawl, but don’t sprint either — along the path and check your surroundings often. Once you get close, line up your shot, call to the rabbit to make it lift its head, then enter Dead Eye to give you all the time you need for a perfect headshot.";Red Dead Redemption 2 guide:

Wildlife researchers recently documented the presence of an Indian gaur in the Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS) in Roha and Murud talukas of Raigad district. According to the Maharashtra forest department, this is the first time a sighting of this species of bison has been reported or documented at the sanctuary.

The Indian Gaur is listed as Schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and is tagged as ‘vulnerable’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List. Gaurs are the world’s largest and tallest wild bovines, with 85% of their current population found in India. Male gaurs weigh 1,000-1,500kg, while females weigh 700-1,000kg. Their height ranges from 165-220cm (5 to 7ft).

The details were revealed in a research paper published on Tuesday in the Zoo’s Print research journal by a team from the Organisation for Wildlife Studies, Mahad, supported by the Maharashtra forest department. The study was carried out between 2018 and 2019.

“While historical records of the animal spread across a variety of habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, etc., across the hilly ranges of the Western Ghats, the northern limit of this animal along the west coast was known to be up to Mahabaleshwar,” said Kunal Salunkhe, lead author of the paper. “This is the first photographic evidence of the Indian Gaur, confirming its presence at PWS.”

On August 18, 2018, the research team of Salunkhe, Pranav Kulkarni, Nagesh Shinde, Titiksha Shevade, and Abhijit Gharat, was informed of the presence of a single gaur near Supegaon village, located inside the sanctuary.

In a bid to confirm the animal’s presence, the team began surveys of likely paths and trails to monitor whether more gaurs were present. However, they failed to locate or photograph the animal.

“A year later, on September 15, 2019, we managed to spot a herd of nine individuals, consisting of two juveniles, two sub-adults and five adults, grazing in a paddy field at the sacred grove area inside PWS. Being elusive species, the herd retreated into the forest,” said Salunkhe.

With tropical deciduous forests, PWS was established in 1986 and is spread across 52.6 square kilometres. It is just 13km away from Kashid beach in Raigad district.

“Gaurs were never known to come this close to the Indian coast till this latest discovery,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife west), Maharashtra forest department. “They have managed to find suitable habitats but it is extremely interesting to know how the population may have made its way from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats to PWS without being noticed. There is no proper identified wildlife corridor between Mahabaleshwar and PWS. Security at PWS has been beefed up to ensure this herd is protected,” said Limaye.

Further genetic studies were needed to assess the source of this population, Salunkhe said, adding that the animals are currently threatened by habitat loss and forest fragmentation. “Diseases, particularly rinderpest, anthrax, and foot and mouth disease, transmitted by domestic cattle, are potentially serious threats. Some animals also die from ingestion of agrochemicals and human response when they wander into farmland and villages,” the study said.";Indian gaur spotted in Konkan sanctuary for the first time in recorded history;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiECcFKBG_SZhRet4sfuvpNBUqFwgEKg4IACoGCAoww7k_MMevCDCDuK0G?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/01/23/Pictures/_bcca890c-3deb-11ea-8d17-9068169bb2f5.jpg;2020-01-23;[{'sent': 'mumbai\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['mumbai']}}, {'sent': '19:53 IST\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['19:53'], 'ORG': ['IST']}}, {'sent': 'Wildlife researchers recently documented the presence of an Indian gaur in the Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary (PWS) in Roha and Murud talukas of Raigad district.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PWS'], 'PERSON': ['Roha', 'Murud talukas']}}, {'sent': 'According to the Maharashtra forest department, this is the first time a sighting of this species of bison has been reported or documented at the sanctuary.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Maharashtra forest department']}}, {'sent': 'I species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and is tagged as ‘vulnerable’ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN)', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'IUCN']}}, {'sent': 'Red List.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Red List']}}, {'sent': 'Gaurs are the world’s largest and tallest wild bovines, with 85% of their current population found in India.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['India']}}, {'sent': 'Male gaurs weigh 1,000-1,500kg, while females weigh 700-1,000kg.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['700-1,000kg', '1,000-1,500kg']}}, {'sent': 'Their height ranges from 165-220cm (5 to 7ft).\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['165-220cm'], 'CARDINAL': ['5']}}, {'sent': 'The details were revealed in a research paper published on Tuesday in the Zoo’s Print research journal by a team from the Organisation for Wildlife Studies, Mahad, supported by the Maharashtra forest department.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Zoo', 'Maharashtra forest department', 'the Organisation for Wildlife Studies'], 'GPE': ['Mahad']}}, {'sent': '“While historical records of the animal spread across a variety of habitats, including tropical forests, grasslands, etc., across the hilly ranges of the Western Ghats, the northern limit of this animal along the west coast was known to be up to Mahabaleshwar,” said Kunal Salunkhe, lead author of the paper.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Mahabaleshwar', 'Kunal Salunkhe']}}, {'sent': '“This is the first photographic evidence of the Indian Gaur, confirming its presence at PWS.”\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PWS']}}, {'sent': 'On August 18, 2018, the research team of Salunkhe, Pranav Kulkarni, Nagesh Shinde, Titiksha Shevade, and Abhijit Gharat, was informed of the presence of a single gaur near Supegaon village, located inside the sanctuary.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Salunkhe'], 'PERSON': ['Kulkarni', 'Abhijit Gharat', 'Nagesh Shinde'], 'GPE': ['Titiksha Shevade', 'Supegaon village']}}, {'sent': '“A year later, on September 15, 2019, we managed to spot a herd of nine individuals, consisting of two juveniles, two sub-adults and five adults, grazing in a paddy field at the sacred grove area inside PWS.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['nine', 'two', 'five'], 'ORG': ['PWS']}}, {'sent': 'Being elusive species, the herd retreated into the forest,” said Salunkhe.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Salunkhe']}}, {'sent': 'With tropical deciduous forests, PWS was established in 1986 and is spread across 52.6 square kilometres.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PWS'], 'QUANTITY': ['52.6 square kilometres']}}, {'sent': 'It is just 13km away from Kashid beach in Raigad district.\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['just 13km'], 'GPE': ['Kashid beach', 'Raigad']}}, {'sent': '“Gaurs were never known to come this close to the Indian coast till this latest discovery,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife west), Maharashtra forest department.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Sunil Limaye', 'Gaurs'], 'ORG': ['Maharashtra forest department']}}, {'sent': '“They have managed to find suitable habitats but it is extremely interesting to know how the population may have made its way from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats to PWS without being noticed.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PWS']}}, {'sent': 'There is no proper identified wildlife corridor between Mahabaleshwar and PWS.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PWS', 'Mahabaleshwar']}}, {'sent': 'Security at PWS has been beefed up to ensure this herd is protected,” said Limaye.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['PWS'], 'PERSON': ['Limaye']}}, {'sent': 'Further genetic studies were needed to assess the source of this population, Salunkhe said, adding that the animals are currently threatened by habitat loss and forest fragmentation.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Salunkhe']}}];Negative

The turtle’s shell is a wondrous thing, allowing the shy reptile a place of refuge when it detects the presence of a predator. However, even this fortress designed by nature isn’t enough to protect these creatures from certain “intelligent” mammals with opposable thumbs, who prey on them for profit and — at times — a taste of its soft flesh.

These days, a joint team of the special task force and the forest department has been assigned to monitor the activities of local fishermen in the swamps of Kali river in the Mainpuri-Etah district. Their objective is to thwart the operations of the Kanjad gang, which prowls the Isan and Arind basin area to catch turtles. The poachers, led by 45-year-old Dharmendra Kanjad, reportedly pack the shelled reptiles in gunny bags that are then couriered to Kolkata via Kanpur. Forest department officers say the Kanjad gang has smuggled over 1,000 turtles this year.

The Kanjad gang is the not the only one targeting the endangered creatures; there are many others who prowl turtle habitats in the Ganga, Yamuna, Chambal, Ghaghra, Sharda, Ken, Betwa and Rapti river basins too. Environmentalist VK Joshi says turtles, which are an important part of the ecological system, keep rivers clean. Killing or whisking them away, therefore, is bound to have an adverse impact on the ecology.

As many as 20,000 turtles are smuggled from UP every year, leading to a precipitous decline in its population. The indiscriminate hunting and smuggling of the creatures has come to a head in recent times, forcing the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau to issue an alert.

Nailing the poachers

Tilotama Verma, additional director of the bureau, recently visited Lucknow and held a meeting with director general of police Javeed Ahmed to discuss the spurt in turtle smuggling from Uttar Pradesh to Southeast Asia. He also made a presentation titled ‘Wildlife crimes: National and international ramifications’ during police week to create awareness on wildlife crime.

The state police have decided to set up a wildlife crime control unit to check turtle smuggling. However, director general of police Javeed Ahmed told HT that recent turtle hauls and arrest of agents have failed to deter smugglers. “We will have to move beyond national borders and coordinate with international agencies to check the crime,” he said.

Additional superintendent of police (special task force) Arvind Kumar Chaturvedi, who heads the wildlife crime control unit, said the focus will be on turtle poachers. “We have set a target of zero turtle poaching in the state,” he added.

The turtle smuggling network in the country extends from UP to Bihar, West Bengal and Assam. Kolkata has emerged as the main transit point for such smugglers, with turtles being illegally shipped to Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Thailand, Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian countries from its shores. There is a huge demand for Indian turtles in the international market for three reasons — meat, its feng shui connection, and production of aphrodisiacs.

According to officials, the turtle smugglers’ network comprises local fishermen who trap turtles, ‘collectors’ who buy the reptiles from them, couriers who transport them to transit points, and traders who ship the consignments to Southeast Asian countries.

MODUS OPERANDI The turtle smugglers’ network comprises local fishermen who trap turtles, ‘collectors’ who buy the reptiles from them, couriers who transport them to transit points, and traders who ship the consignments to Southeast Asian countries

Kolkata has emerged as the main transit point for such smugglers, with turtles being illegally shipped to Bangladesh, Myanmar, China, Thailand, Hong Kong and other Southeast Asian countries from its shores The turtle hunting season reaches its peak in the post-monsoon months of September and October. From November to January, turtles are transported to Kolkata from local hideouts

Though the special task force (STF) nabbed some of the poachers and busted the courier operation, the kingpin remains at large. “We have information that the traders who run the smuggling racket are based in Kolkata, but haven’t been able to locate their hideouts,” Chaturvedi said. STF and forest department officials nabbed 10 turtle poachers in Ambedkar Nagar district recently. While two of them were locals, eight hailed from West Bengal.

“This menace can be curbed only if we catch everybody in the smuggling racket, all the way from ground zero (the villages where turtles are captured) to Kolkata,” a police officer said.

Bhadohi district forest officer Manish Kumar Singh said smugglers recruit poor villagers in their illegal hunt for turtles. “They pay a pittance to the hunters and sell the turtles at a premium in the Kolkata market,” he added.

On the brink

Shailendra Singh, programme director of the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) in Lucknow, said seven of the 14 turtle species in the state face extinction. “The demand for their meat and shells in national and international markets has led to a spurt in smuggling,” he said, adding that many also keep them as pets.

Rampant poaching has resulted in the virtual extinction of the shelled reptiles in Bihar, and the consequent shifting of focus to the river basins of UP, said Shailendra. The price of the turtle varies in accordance with demand. The meat of the Indian flapshell turtle — known as ‘sundari’ — can fetch between ?5,000 and ?10,000 per kg. On the other hand, the meat of the Indian softshell turtle (called katahwa) costs ?5,000 to ?15,000 for the same quantity. Though small, the spotted pond turtle sells for $500 dollar each in Thailand. Turtles from UP are usually smuggled to Hong Kong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok.

The gangs involved in turtle smuggling are well-knit, and possess expert information on turtle habitats. The turtle hunting season reaches its peak in the post-monsoon months of September and October. From November to January, turtles are transported to Kolkata.

Even if a consignment of turtles is recovered, releasing them into their natural habitat turns out to be a challenge for the TSA. “The smugglers collect turtles from various regions and pack them in gunny bags for transportation. We have to ensure that the turtles captured from the Chambal, Ghaghra and Ganga basins are re-released in their respective habitats for survival,” Shailendra said.

Considering that turtles are transported by train almost as often as road, government railway police personnel (GRP) have been directed to be on the lookout for potential smugglers. “We have nabbed several couriers and seized hundreds of turtles,” Gopal Gupta, director general of the Railways, said.

The UP forest department, for its part, has issued a statewide alert. In a letter to divisional and district forest officers, principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Rupak Dey said forest officials nabbed turtle poachers in various districts — including Kanpur and Allahabad — recently. He has directed them to conduct raids with the help of STF personnel and the local police to crack down on poachers.";Turtle hunters feast on river basins of UP, more than 20k turtles smuggled every

 Lowland Anoa;Bubalus depressicornis;Indonesia;EN;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Artiodactyla;Bovidae;Bubalus;depressicornis;I;Indonesia;;"Earth is home to an extensive web of incredibly complex and wildly diverse ecosystems. The harmonious interaction among these ecosystems is what allows life to thrive at Earth’s deepest depths and highest peaks. But one species has upset the balance.

“It’s no secret that humans have had an impact on Earth’s biodiversity,” said Molly Corder, a spring 2018 graduate of the Department of Biology’s Professional Science Master’s (PSM) in Zoo, Aquarium and Animal Shelter Management. “Today’s scientists are tasked with the race against time to save endangered species and bring back nearly extinct ones,” she said.

Finding her calling

Corder credits the Colorado State University PSM program for opening the door for her to join the ranks of a generation of scientists determined to undo the biodiversity loss that has become so evident in today’s world. Here, she found a new passion in conservation medicine, the study of the overlapping features among human, animal and environmental health. This discovery was inspired by the wide variety of classes she took, which ranged from animal behavior, biomedical and reproductive sciences to nonprofit conservation administration, marketing and applied data analysis for clinical research.

“I love the PSM program because in many ways this master’s degree is like a blank canvas,” said Corder. “You find what your passion is here, and then you’re given a paint brush to bring your own creative approach to conservation. We’re not asked about what we want to be when we grow up. We’re asked about which problems we want to solve in the world. Before coming to CSU, I had never heard about conservation medicine. Now I plan to make it my career.”

The PSM degree offers a unique opportunity for students to blend business skills and applied science with a specific focus on helping animal organizations. This dynamic and flexible program provides students who have a passion for animals with the tools necessary to make a difference by allowing them to build their own degree that is suited to their specific career goals.

“PSM students dedicate their careers to improving animal welfare and conservation science with the hope that zoos will be able to work together to restore critically important habitats and provide a better world for animals,” said Corder.

Zoos: a modern-day ark

During her time as a PSM student, Corder also studied and conducted research at the South-East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction and Conservation in Yulee, Florida. The not-for-profit group connects scientists, veterinarians and animal managers with forward-thinking zoos, aquariums and wildlife preserves to provide solutions to reproduction challenges. There, Corder was able to apply reproductive techniques that she learned at CSU, such as gamete rescue (the recovery of reproductive cells from recently deceased animals) and cryopreservation (the ability to freeze and thaw these cells while keeping them viable) with exotic animals in the field.

“We worked on everything from staghorn coral to African elephant reproduction,” said Corder. “It was an experience I will never forget.”

Corder’s CSU capstone project focused on examining the value of zoos in clinical research and conservation medicine, with an emphasis in reproduction for an endangered miniature buffalo species, the lowland anoa. Her research helped improve the timing and accuracy behind their reproductive procedures.

Corder also helped with fertility exams on cheetahs and elephants as well as working to pioneer the gamete preservation technologies on sharks and stingrays to improve and increase captive breeding in aquariums. She assisted with a field project that successfully preserved gametes from a recently deceased Banteng, an endangered bovid species in Indonesia.

“Zoos are so much more than entertainment parks,” said Corder. “In many ways, zoos are ‘arks’ for the future of our planet’s biodiversity. It’s hard to comprehend, but the wild doesn’t really exist anymore, at least not like it used to. Humans have reached even the farthest corners of the world. This has created competition for resources and brought about new challenges in maintaining ecological health. And of course, there are geopolitical and social issues that are deeply intertwined with ecological integrity.”

Hope for endangered species

The world held witness to the death of the last male northern white rhinoceros last March, after the species endured decades of poaching and habitat loss. Corder worked with the South-East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction and Conservation to generate data to inform the San Diego Zoo’s Northern White Rhino Initiative; this program attempts to resurrect the now functionally extinct species with cutting-edge technology. She performed some of the hormone testing involved in predicting and manipulating the ovulation events of southern white rhinos, a closely related sub-species. Just this summer, the Northern White Rhino Initiative announced that one of the female southern white rhinos transported from Africa is pregnant from an artificial insemination procedure.

“This is one of the first times this has happened, which is a huge win for the conservation science community,” said Corder. “It means that while it’s still a long shot for [northern white rhinos] to be saved from extinction, it may be possible. Even if we’re not successful at saving this sub-species, this research will lay the foundation for assisted reproductive technology development used to help other critically endangered species.”

CSU researchers have used reproductive technology such as in vitro fertilization to bolster bison populations that are also free of brucellosis, a population-threatening disease.

A bright future

Corder has accepted a position to become a Smithsonian scientist, where she plans to keep working to end extinction. She will also be pursuing her doctorate with George Mason University in Washington, D.C., and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. She hopes to build on the existing research that modifies assisted reproductive technologies for endangered species in addition to adding a further level of clinical research and conservation medicine.

Komodo Dragon;Varanus komodoensis;Indonesia;Vulnerable;2020-06-18;Animalia;Reptilia;Sauria;Varanidae;Varanus;komodoensis;I;Indonesia;;"A joint effort between the University of Melbourne and Queensland Museum, the palaeontological dig has unearthed fossils of two new extinct Australian megafaunas. The two species, a 2.5- metre, 274kg kangaroo and 6-metre lizard, are estimated to have lived in the northern parts of Australia 40 000 years ago.

The mammoth marsupial is officially the largest kangaroo of all time, says Scott Hocknull, paleontologist with the Queensland Museum and honorary faculty member at the University of Melbourne.

“While the rest of the world had giant carnivores like sabre-toothed cats, bears, and hyenas, Australia’s predators were mostly giant reptiles, including an extinct freshwater croc around seven meters long, a relation to the modern saltwater crocodile, and a land-dwelling crocodile,” he said on the university website.

“There were also two giant lizards including a six-meter-long lizard called Megalania and another giant lizard, similar in size to the Komodo dragon,” he added.

The dig is located at South Walker Creek near Mackay, Queensland, where extreme environmental changes caused the species’ downfall.

“The megafauna at South Walker Creek were uniquely tropical, dominated by huge reptilian carnivores and mega-herbivores that went extinct around 40,000 years ago, well after humans arrived onto mainland Australia,” says Hocknull.

“We cannot place humans at this 40,000-year-old crime scene, we have no firm evidence. Therefore, we find no role for humans in the extinction of these species of megafauna.

“Instead, we do find that their extinction is coincident with major climatic and environmental deterioration both locally and regionally, including increased fire, reduction in grasslands, and loss of freshwater. Together, these sustained changes were simply too much for the largest of Australia’s animals to cope with.”

“The Board of Directors from the Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation are extremely excited that we have found the megafauna within our traditional country,” a Barada Barna Aboriginal Corporation spokesperson said.

“The Barada Barna people have an immensely proud history dating back to our first encounters with Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845 on the banks of Cherwell Creek and having discovered megafauna only enriches our history within this region.

Pull out your fishing rods and get ready to catch some catfish.

On Wednesday, as part of its Neighborhood Fishin' program, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) began stocking thousands of catfish at 19 lakes across Texas, including four in the Houston area, according to a recent release.

'That's the biggest fish we have ever pulled in': 198-pound alligator gar caught in the Brazos River

Each lake will receive continuous stockings of channel catfish every two weeks now through early November, with Mary Jo Peckham Park receiving a total of 9,230 catfish and Missouri City C.P.L. receiving 5,538.

Burke-Crenshaw Lake in Pasadena is set to get 7,020 total catfish and Herman Little Pond in Spring is scheduled for 5,538.

Other lakes in the Lone Star State being stocked include five in Dallas-Fort Worth, two in the Austin area and in San Antonio, and one in Abilene, Amarillo, Bryan-College Station, San Angelo, Waco and Wichita Falls.

It's official: 67.1-pound fish caught by 13-year-old sets a new Texas record

All anglers can keep up to five fish per day without a minimum length limit, according to a recent release. At some locations, cleaning tables are available to make it easy for you to clean your catch.

""Our Neighborhood Fishin' lakes are conveniently located in these urban and suburban areas so that Texans don't have to travel outside the city to have a great fishing experience,"" TPWD inland fisheries management and research chief Dave Terre said in the release.

""Catfish are fun and easy to catch for anglers of all ages and experience levels,"" he added.

To find the Neighborhood Fishin' lake near you, head to the Neighborhood Fishin' website.

In an update of the IUCN Red List, the leatherback sea turtle (Dermochelys coriacea) has been moved from Critically Endangered to Vulnerable. However, conservationists warn that the species still remains hugely endangered—and in rapid decline—in many parts of its range.

The new assessment found that the population of leatherback turtles in the northwest Atlantic Ocean (along the US and the Caribbean) is on the road to recover due to conservation actions. While scientists aren’t sure how the southeast Atlantic population (mostly in Gabon) is faring, it remains the world’s largest population.

However, the situation in the Pacific is far more bleak. The east Pacific population has dropped by 97 percent in three leatherback generations, while the west Pacific population has fell by 80 percent during the same period.

“The persistence of significant threats in all regions warrants concern for the future viability of even the largest subpopulations. Current efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats must be maintained—or even augmented, where possible—to reverse declines in Pacific and Indian Ocean subpopulations and to sustain population growth in the Northwest Atlantic,” the assessors write.

Leatherback sea turtles face a variety of major threats, including fisheries’ bycatch, human consumption of their eggs and meat, coastal development, light pollution, plastic pollution, and climate change.

Longline fisheries in Costa Rica hook tens of thousands of sea turtles every year

(11/14/2013) Hundreds of kilometers of commercial fishing lines slither along coastal waters in Costa Rica, hooking thousands of mahi-mahi and many other marketable fish. But when scientists scrutinized fishermen’s catch, they were shocked by the staggering number of sea turtles accidentally snagged on the lines.

Ultraviolet nets significantly reduce sea turtle bycatch

(11/11/2013) Bycatch, a side-effect of commercial fishing in which non-target species are accidentally caught, is linked to severe population declines in several species. Sea turtles are particularly impacted by small-scale coastal gillnetting practices, in which large nets are deployed and indiscriminately snag anything of a certain size that attempts to swim through them. However, that may soon change.

California celebrates its inaugural Pacific Leatherback Conservation Day with sobering reality

(10/15/2013) On an isolated beach in Bird’s Head Peninsula, Indonesia, a female leatherback turtle shuffles out of the ocean and onto the shore, ready to lay her eggs. Under the cover of night she excavates a hole in the sand, depositing anywhere from 80 to 100 eggs inside. Using her flippers she flicks sand over the eggs, hiding them from potential predators. Then, shuffling away, she returns to the turquoise waters ready to make an 8,500-mile journey across the Pacific Ocean to the California coast.

Are sea turtles responsible for lower fish catches in India?

(08/29/2013) Fishing communities on Agatti Island in Lakshwadeep, India, blame their reduced fish catch on green turtles; according to them, green turtles chomp their way through the seagrass beds lining the shallow reef waters that are essential for fish to breed. This leads some in the community to clandestinely kill sea turtles and destroy their nests.

We've already introduced you to Flick, the chameleon artist who adores all things creepy crawly and took the place of Nat in hosting Bug Offs. Now it's time to meet his partner C.J.! C.J., or as fans speculate Chip Junior, is the son of Chip, the beaver who hosted Fishing Tourneys in previous Animal Crossing games. He is young and loves to livestream fishing for his many followers. We here at iMore have all the details on C.J. and his fishing challenges! Who is C.J. and why does he want my fish?

Son of Chip, the beaver who hosted Fishing Tourneys in previous Animal Crossing Games, C.J. is the go-to guy for all things fishing in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Much like his partner, Flick, C.J. will buy all the fish you bring him for 150% what Timmy and Tommy will pay at Nook's Cranny. He also hosts Seasports Challenges and Fishing Tourneys, and takes commissions for fish statues made by Flick. Unlike his father (who happily ate every fish brought to him,) C.J. is more interested in exciting his livestream fans.

On most of C.J.'s visits, he is simply looking for footage that will entertain his fans. On these days, he will show up on your island at 5 a.m. and stay the entire day. He will also offer you a Seasports Challenge, and if you complete the challenge, he will buy all the fish you bring him for 150% the normal price. His challenges always involve catching three fish in a row, without any getting away (or being scared away, so walk gently!) but which fish he looks for changes. Sometimes, he will ask for three tiny fish in a row. Other times, he might want three giant fish in a row. Either way, you need to catch those three fish before he will buy from you or let you commission a fish statue. Fortunately, the challenges aren't that difficult, and you have all day to complete them. What is a Fishing Tourney?

In addition to his Seasports Challenges, on the second Saturday of January, April, July, and October from 9 a.m.-6 p.m., C.J. will host a Fishing Tourney. On these days, you can complete a special challenge: catch as many fish as possible in three minutes. On these days, everyone on your island will take part in the festivities, gathering at the rivers, lakes, and beaches to catch fish! You'll want to have lots of fishing rods crafted and ready to go for the Fishing Tourneys, as well as lots of fish bait. Because fish bait is time consuming to craft, we recommend you devote some time in the days leading up to the Tourney to craft as much of this useful item as possible. In case you need a refresher, you craft fish bait by following these easy steps: Go to any beach with a shovel and lots of space in your pocket. Search for Manila Clams. These's little clams hide in the sand and will occasionally shoot little streams of water up, indicating their location. Dig up a Manila Clam. Repeat until your pockets are full. Take the Manila Clams to your D.I.Y. Workbench. Press A to access your D.I.Y. Workbench. Press A to select ""Let's craft!"" Press A to select Fish bait. Press A to select Craft it! Press A to select Let's do it!"" Repeat until you've used all your Manila Clams. Once you've crafted a lot of fish bait, you can keep it in your house or storage until its time for the Fishing Tourney. For more on how to catch the most fish and all the awesome rewards you can earn, make sure to check out our C.J.'s Fishing Tourney Guide! What are the best fish to sell to C.J.?

While each month brings new fish to your waters, not all of those fish are worth the effort it takes to catch them, and there are some fish that are worth holding onto until C.J. comes around (even if it is tempting to sell them at Nook's Cranny!) The following fish are the most valuable in the game (all worth at least 5,000 Bells), and definitely worth saving.

Not all of these fish are available all the time, and the months they are available changes based on which hemisphere you live in. Add the possibility of time travel and finding the right fish to sell can be tricky! You also don't have to limit yourself to these fish. Remember, C.J. will buy any fish you bring him, so if you have the room to save more fish, by all means, bring him everything from the tiniest Tadpole to the massive Coelacanth!

Mountain Sweet Pitcher-plant;Sarracenia rubra jonesii;United States of America;;2020-06-18;Plantae;;Nepenthales;Sarraceniaceae;Sarracenia;rubra;I;United States of America;;"There’s perhaps no other species of plant in North Carolina as recognizable as the Catawba rhododendron. Its shiny leaves and gorgeous blooms are ubiquitous throughout the North Carolina mountains.

Yet the familiar shrub isn’t necessarily beloved by experts concerned about the uncertain impact of climate change on the forests of Southern Appalachia. Its shallow root system can easily conquer and dominate steep slopes where other trees and plants struggle to gain a foothold after a fire, landslide or other natural or human disturbance. That’s one reason tangles of rhododendron cover mountain slopes from waterways to ridge crests.

Senior geologist for geohazards Rick Wooten of the NC Geological Survey in Asheville told Carolina Public Press that the combination of more dramatic rain events and the expansion of weakly rooted species can destabilize mountain slopes.

“Healthy forests hold the soil in place,” Wooten said. “Deep-rooted trees contribute more to slope stability. What concerns me about climate change is, if there are more frequent storms that result in more intense and prolonged periods of rainfall then we can expect an increase in flooding and landslide activity in the mountains.”

But landslides are just one of an array of the possible effects of a changing climate on one of the most biodiverse and complex forest ecologies on the planet. There’s also the spread of invasive plants, pests and animals; difficult to predict rainfall and drought patterns; and the threat of more frequent and damaging forest fires.

“You can see the direct impact of climate change on our ecosystem services and how they change in response to a variety of threats; they’re all inter-related in this complex system,” said Jim Fox, director of UNC Asheville’s National Environmental Modeling and Analysis Center based at the Collider in downtown Asheville. “We’re seeing a different reality in our forests.”

Those prospects have captured the attention of Wooten, Fox and other experts who are attempting to understand the near and long-term effects of climate change on Western North Carolina’s forests.

Of course, warmer temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are beyond the control of forest managers. Planner Michelle Aldridge of the U.S. Forest Service said developing strategies to respond to the impacts of climate change is a building block of the draft Pisgah-Nantahala National Forest Management Plan, which addresses the long-term health of the forest. Currently the Forest Service is revising the plan, which is slated to be finalized in 2019. A draft plan and a draft environmental impact statement are expected to be released next spring.

“Climate change has the potential to influence biodiversity, forest health, water resources and even recreation in the national forest,” Aldridge said. The agency’s aim is to apply the best available science to understand how climate change influences the ecological integrity of the forest, she said. Among their available tools to address the threats of climate change is TACCIMO (Template for Assessing Climate Change Impacts and Management Options), a web-based application designed to connect land managers with updated peer-reviewed science about managing healthy forests.

Fox said his organization has collaborated with the Forest Service on several projects that use climate and weather data, maps, and satellite imagery to understand how the wooded landscape of WNC is changing over time. For example, NEMAC is a partner in developing the Landscape Dynamics Assessment Tool (LanDAT) designed to help resource managers analyze landscape and forest changes using satellite imagery.

“We can look at areas smaller than a football field to see where trees are stressed, where forests have burned and what plants are replacing them,” he said. “We also have 15 years of data to see how forests are changing through time.”

Fox explained that while a warmer climate may be likely, greater weather variability particularly perplexes forest managers, with potentially high rainfall periods followed by relatively long dry spells.

“You have a natural system already stressed by land-use changes, invasive plants and insects, and population growth,” Fox said. “The worry is all of these things coming together and adding climate variability on top of it.”

While their climate data and tools may be useful, Fox said it requires people with the expertise to apply it. “Our role is to provide climate information at the right scale and the right tools for local forest managers to integrate into their planning and management,” he said.

While some forest plants and animals may thrive despite an unpredictable climate future, Southern Blue Ridge stewardship project manager Adam Warwick of The Nature Conservancy said that species that depend on specific growing conditions may be in peril. The impact of climate change may be most evident, he said, in high elevation habitats, such as spruce-fir forests, or other environments that have unique micro climates, including mountain bogs.

“The spruce-fir forest have a diverse set of species that have adapted to colder high-elevation micro climates,” he said. The strain of higher temperatures and long, dry periods can make the trees that live above 4,500 feet more susceptible to insect outbreaks or disease. Warwick said that Southern Appalachian bogs are dependent on groundwater and harbour a rare set of species, such as the mountain sweet pitcher plant that can only thrive in a narrow set of growing conditions which can be altered by variations in rainfall and temperature.

“If we have lower water tables, then you start to get competition from other species, so we’ll have to work harder to nurse these unique islands of habitat,” Warwick said. “They will have a tougher time surviving. If these rare species disappear, then we lose part of our biodiversity.”

To adapt, Warwick said that more hands on management is necessary to keep pioneering species out and the rare species in.

In fact, one of the goals of the Pisgah-Nantahala forest management plan revision process has been to define forest-wide strategies to manage the national forests, after a lack of oversight has allowed the forest structure and composition to change dramatically over the past century. While there have been plenty of clashes among forest advocates and users in the planning process, one thing most can agree on is that suppressing wildfire has been a major force in altering the ecological composition of WNC’s forests.

“We have some of the largest relatively unfragmented swaths of forest land on the east coast, but there are certain forest types that are ecologically out of whack,” said Warwick, including the highly flammable rhododendron that has spread from areas near rivers where they belong to slopes and ridges where they provide fuel for fires, making blazes far more dangerous and destructive.

In 1915 the North Carolina General Assembly authorized the first state fire wardens to fight fires and clear brush along rail lines to keep sparks at bay and to protect forests that were prized for their timber value. In 1935, the U.S. Forest Service developed a so-called “10 a.m. policy” which mandated fires be snuffed by the next morning. However, research in the 1960s and 1970s led to a shift in Forest Service policy to a “let-burn” policy. While forest managers now generally view fires as vital to the health of a forest, state forest managers are still mandated to suppress wildfires to protect people and property.

Wooten of the NCGS said his agency is cooperating with the U.S. Geological Survey, the forest service, and Chimney Rock State Park to study the stability of steep slopes affected by last year’s wildfires. In 2016, 51 wildfires burned over 50,000 acres throughout the mountains.

“It’s a big concern if we have recurring seasons of drought-related wildfires followed by active hurricane seasons where storms track over the mountains,” Wooten said. In 2004, for example, the remnants of Hurricanes Frances and Ivan passed through the region, triggering more than 400 landslides.

While extreme weather events and fires have a glaring impact on the forest, there may be less evident, yet just as worrisome threats to the forest.

In addition to the spread of rhododendron, the absence of fire and warmer growing seasons have also allowed other tree species that tend to require more water, such as the fast-growing tulip poplar, to colonize forests and dominate the canopy in place of trees that process moisture more efficiently, such as oak.

“That’s a large quantity of water we’re talking about when that trend is pervasive across 1 million acres of national forest. If you couple that with increased drought, there’s less water coming from the forest,” Warwick explained. “When you consider how many people are moving to the region and that Asheville and Charlotte get their water from (rivers that rise in) the national forest, then forest health is definitely a human problem too.”";WNC forests face threat of erratic and extreme weather as climate

Researchers working in Kerinci Seblat National Park have captured a remarkable image of a mother Asian golden cat (Catopuma temminckii) carrying her young in her mouth. The image was taken in mid-2014 as reported by Mongabay Indonesia by the Sumatran Tiger Research Team.

Asian golden cats are just one of five wild cat species found in Kerinci Seblat National Park. The park is also home to the Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae), the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi), the marbled cat (Pardofelis marmorata), and the leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis).

The Asian golden cat is a medium-sized feline, around two to three times heavier than a domestic cat. It ranges across Southeast Asia and is currently listed as Near Threatened by the IUCN Red List. Like many other predators, the cat is threatened in the region by deforestation, prey decline, snaring, and the illegal trade in cat bones and parts. In Indonesia there is a thriving trade in these wild animals over the Internet, according to Mongabay Indonesia. Worse still, Sumatra has one of the highest deforestation rates on the planet.

Still, Asian golden cats remain much less threatened than Sunda clouded leopard and marbled cat (both listed as Vulnerable), and, of course, Sumatran tigers which are considered Critically Endangered.

“Asian golden cats are animals that are generalists, which means more adaptive to changes in existing land cover,” Iding Achmad Haidir, a researcher studying smaller cats who uploaded the photo, told Mongabay Indonesia.

Haidir further noted that researchers have found that Asian golden cats and Sunda clouded leopards generally avoid each other, i.e. where there are a lot of Asian golden cats there are few Sunda clouded leopard and vice versa. But in areas with large prey densities, these two species appear to live side-by-side and even share their territory with the island’s top predator, the Sumatran tiger.

The research is a collaboration between Kerinci Seblat National Park, WildCRU Oxford University, the Clouded Leopard Project, Point Defiance Zoo & Aquarium, Fauna & Flora International (FFI), and the Rufford Foundation.

 Greater Bamboo Lemur;Prolemur simus;Madagascar;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Primates;Lemuridae;Prolemur;simus;I;Madagascar;;"Are protected areas good for forests?

Yes, but we can only say this with confidence for forest cover.

In countries that are at least partly in the tropics, studies suggest that strictly protected forests generally have lower levels of forest clearing or degradation than unprotected forests.

But here’s a caveat: more than half of the 39 studies that looked at the effects of protected areas on forest cover relied on subjective perceptions, simple comparisons or trends, without showing a definitive cause-and-effect relationship between the creation of the protected area and the changes they detected.

For instance, a widely cited study published in the high-profile journal Science in 2001 interviewed park managers, researchers and NGO staff across 93 protected areas, and concluded that tropical parks have been “surprisingly effective at protecting the ecosystems and species within their borders.” Another study measured changes in forest cover across 48 East African protected areas between 2001 and 2009 and compared it to rates of deforestation within 10 kilometers of the parks. The researchers concluded that about half of the parks were effective (that is, they were gaining or maintaining forest cover), while the rest were ineffective, or losing forest cover. But without accounting for what the likely rates of forest loss would have been in the absence of protection, the study could not determine whether the parks were truly effective or not.

Even so, 15 of the studies used more rigorous designs and their results also suggest that protecting forests reduces deforestation.

A 2015 study from Brazil found that strictly protected areas in the notorious arc of deforestation, where most forest clearing in the Amazon occurs, had considerably lower deforestation rates than unprotected areas with similar characteristics. Another study, from Thailand, found that creating protected areas increased forest cover in general. Yet another well-designed global analysis of protected areas across 147 countries found that protected areas were, on average, less likely to be cleared than control unprotected areas.

There was a common thread across these rigorous studies. They found that going the conventional route, comparing forest cover change inside protected areas with that outside, tended to overestimate the positive effect of parks.

The impacts of protected areas also vary depending on when and where you look.

Take Mexico, for example. Between 1993 and 2000, most protected areas in the country were essentially “paper parks,” researchers wrote in a 2015 study: that is, the parks had minimal management, funding, staffing, planning and enforcement. Such parks, on average, seemed to have no effect in reducing forest cover loss compared to similar, unprotected forests. However, between 2000 and 2005, a period of substantial increase in parks funding and management, protected areas did lower forest cover loss considerably, a 2016 study found. On the surface, this suggests that management and funding of parks affects their “effectiveness.” But the study did not probe this, so we cannot say if it is indeed the case.

The effects of protected areas can also vary based on forest type. In China, for instance, a protected area in northwest Yunnan province failed to reduce overall forest loss, but it did reduce the loss of old-growth forests, researchers found. From a conservation point of view, at least, this might seem like a good outcome because old-growth forests are known to harbor high levels of endemic and threatened species.

The results of the meta-analyses — one that included 34 studies, and another that looked at 20 studies — found generally positive results. But again, these papers based their conclusions on studies that compared deforestation rates inside protected areas with those outside, which could be overestimating the parks’ effectiveness.

Also, by looking only at forest cover, the available research gives only a bird’s-eye view of the health of a forest. The studies do not reveal what’s going on deeper inside. “You may have a protected area with good forest cover but it may also have a lot of hunting that may be eliminating bird populations. This is the kind of damage that you cannot see from space,” Duke University’s Pimm said.

In Madagascar, for example, poachers go deep into national parks to illegally hunt animals, including lemurs. “So even though you’re protecting the trees, you have an empty forest,” Stony Brook University’s Wright said. “And that’s a shame.”

We did not find any credible evidence on the impacts of protected areas on illegal hunting, however.

Rigorous studies looking into the impacts of protected areas on biodiversity also seem to be rare — a glaring gap considering that biodiversity conservation is a key goal of protected areas. There are a number of case reports that try to measure populations of wild mammals, birds, reptiles or insects over time inside protected forests. And a few even compare the species’ population trends with what’s been observed outside the protected areas.

A meta-analysis published in 2014 summarized findings from 86 such studies. The researchers found that protected areas generally had higher diversity and abundance of individual species than surrounding areas. But whether these patterns are a consequence of the protected areas, the analysis cannot show.

While not ideal, this paucity of species data is understandable, experts say. To study how protected areas affect the species inside them you need rigorous field-based monitoring, they say, which in turn needs funding, resources and support that is often severely lacking. In India, for example, park authorities often don’t even allow researchers into protected areas.

“It is very difficult to get permits to work inside parks,” Harini Nagendra, a professor of sustainability at Azim Premji University in Bangalore, India, told Mongabay. “And then donors also don’t want to support the kind of money and people it takes to do field monitoring.”

Researchers run into other problems in trying to learn how protected areas affect species. For example, if an endangered species occurs only in a few places, and governments have created protected areas around that habitat, it’s entirely possible there simply are no suitable areas to serve as a basis for comparison. “In such cases, you can’t do any kind of detailed attribution of impact because those species occur only in those few places and there is no control site,” said E.J. Milner-Gulland, a professor of biodiversity at Oxford University, U.K. “In that case, you can look at trends in those species populations.”

In a global analysis, William Laurance and his team tried to look at this kind of trend. By tapping into the expert opinions of more than 260 field biologists, they collated data on the changes in status of about 30 groups of species over the past 20 to 30 years for 60 protected areas across the world’s tropical forests. Their results were disheartening: nearly half of the parks they surveyed showed serious declines in biodiversity. Top predators and large mammals, such as tigers or rhinos, seemed to be doing especially poorly, as did amphibians and old-growth trees.

Although the study does not attempt to determine what the trends might have been in the absence of protected areas, it does tell us about the state of biodiversity within those protected areas. It also gives people an idea about whether conservation efforts are pushing those trends in the direction they desire or not.

Getting this data was extremely hard, Laurance said. “I think we tried to initially do this in 18 months and it ended up being like four years,” he said. What the study also revealed was that there were glaring data gaps for many groups of species, he added. While larger mammals, bigger birds and some reptiles had lots of data points, other taxonomic groups were extremely data-poor.

“What you’d really like to have across all of your protected areas is some kind of basic sampling, something that was done in the same way over roughly the same period of time,” Laurance said. “But what you’ll find is that somebody here has been monitoring elephants for 30 years, and somebody there has been monitoring ground-nesting birds. So it’s really difficult to make some kind of broad inferences. Some kind of data standardization is really important.”

Are protected areas socioeconomically beneficial for local people?

There is not enough evidence to say.

A common charge is that protected areas make people poorer, especially in developing countries. But the link between protected areas and poverty is complicated.

Regions of rich biodiversity often overlap with areas of extreme poverty. And protected areas are frequently created in places that have some of the poorest people to begin with, often because these places are remote or have low economic potential. Robust evaluations that can tell us whether the poverty is caused by protected areas or simply by pre-existing conditions are only now beginning to emerge.

The five rigorous studies we found, of 15 studies in total, concluded that the protected areas either reduced poverty levels among local people, compared to people living near similar, unprotected forests, or at least did not worsen them. But these effects were not universal.

Take for example two protected areas — Kulen Promtep Wildlife Sanctuary and Preah Vihear Protected Forest — located in remote parts of Cambodia. These protected areas contain 16 villages that have existed in those forests for years. The people living in those villages are typically subsistence farmers who grow rice, researchers write in a study published in 2014, and earn some extra income by selling tree resins used to make varnish, cheap soap, leather, and sealing wax.

The study found that villages inside the parks were overall much better off than similar villages in control sites, suggesting that the two protected areas generally reduced poverty levels. But that doesn’t mean protected areas benefited everybody within the study area.

“The overall trend disguised relative differences for sub-groups of the population,” explained lead author Tom Clements of the Wildlife Conservation Society. “Protected areas secured land and forest resources against grabs by outsiders. This benefited people within the protected areas who depended upon forest resources and agriculture for their livelihoods, because they were permitted by the protected area authorities to continue to use these resources. By contrast, people outside protected areas experienced widespread land-use change and external resource grabs. At the same time, people inside protected areas who had no land or forest user rights, or who wanted to grow cash crops that the protected areas strictly restricted, had much more limited opportunities to increase their wellbeing.”

Another study found that communities living near protected areas in Costa Rica and Thailand were overall better off than similar communities living in unprotected areas. Parks in both countries were also generally effective in reducing deforestation.

Again, this might sound like a win-win outcome, but it isn’t, Ferraro at Johns Hopkins and Hanauer at Sonoma State reported in a 2011 study. The two researchers dug deeper into the data from Costa Rica and found that the effects of parks on people and forests vary depending on where they are placed.

Protected areas created on land that is highly suitable for agriculture, for example, avoided the highest amounts of forest loss: that is, deforestation rates would have been very high in the absence of those protected areas. The same protected areas also worsened poverty, possibly because the cost of losing access to valuable agricultural land is high. In contrast, protected areas placed on land with lower agricultural potential showed the least avoided deforestation, likely because those areas weren’t very threatened to begin with. Protected areas in these places also reduced poverty the most. There were some protected areas that were in between: they offered both modest reductions in forest loss and poverty.

But the researchers caution against reading too much into these results. This is because poverty is a vague word, Ferraro said, one that can mean different things to different people. Some researchers look at household incomes or assets as measures of human welfare or poverty. Others look at infrastructure development, indicators of health, food security or country-specific poverty indices. “There is also the problem that we could be missing dimensions and not measuring all the relevant dimensions because we’re limited by the data,” Ferraro said. “Someone could be measuring two to three dimensions of human welfare and conclude that protected areas don’t hurt people. That’s a strong leap.”

Moreover, socioeconomic effects of protected areas change over time, but very few studies have looked at these shifting effects.

Hard data on some other socioeconomic effects of protected areas (such as conflict between people and park authorities or between people and wildlife; impacts on people’s land rights, access to forest resources or employment opportunities) are also limited. There are some scattered case reports, largely based on interview surveys and anecdotes, that suggest that protected areas might be making people worse-off. But those tell us little about the extent to which protected areas drive these perceptions compared to other sociopolitical factors.

A couple of case reports show, for instance, that protected areas can create multiple employment opportunities for local people. Around Kibale National Park in Uganda, over 800 local people found jobs in 2010 as research assistants, in tourist facilities, or in forest management activities like planting trees, a study published in 2012 found. While overall the people took home annual salaries totaling $570,839, the benefits were not equitably distributed. Wealthier households and people living closer to the protected area captured most of the jobs, the authors wrote.

Experts said they had observed similar trends elsewhere.

Madagascar’s Ranomafana National Park, Wright said, has led to an economic boom in the region. She has yet to calculate the latest figures, but as of 2009, tourism and research in the park — which she says would not occur without the park — had brought over $1.8 million into the region. People from area villages got jobs in hotels, restaurants and health and education centers, or as tourist guides or research assistants. Here, too, people living closer to the park and its main roads tended to claim most of the benefits.

Overall, though, the evidence of the socioeconomic effects of protected areas is extremely thin and mixed, a finding that concurs with a systematic review published in 2013.

(There are studies that look specifically at how tourism or ecotourism affect people around protected areas. But that was not the focus of our review, and we are unable to comment on those findings.)

Verdict

It came as a surprise to find so few rigorous studies for a strategy as popular and well-established as protected areas.

What scientific literature does exist suggests that terrestrial protected areas help reduce deforestation, but to varying degrees. In some places, parks avoid high rates of forest loss; in others, the effects are modest to negligible. But finer details about the health of protected forests (the status of biodiversity, levels of hunting or logging) are harder to get.

The evidence for how protected areas affect local people is also extremely limited. There are only a handful of rigorous studies, and these suggest that parks do not generally exacerbate poverty. That does not mean that parks are universally good, though. The studies looked at only a few parks, in a few countries, and may have missed aspects of human welfare that could be more relevant for some people than the ones they measured.

“What I find demoralizing is not that we don’t know as much as we ought to, but that we are still dragging our feet in investing in knowing,” said Ferraro.

And not knowing whether parks work generally will make it harder to determine what makes some parks successful and others not. That, experts say, is likely to be the most useful to decision makers.

“These protected area networks will exist,” Ferraro said. “We are not going to degazette them en masse. So we need to look at how we can make them most effective on both environmental and social outcomes: Should we put more investment into enforcement? Should we put more investment into bringing in local communities? Should we make the rules stricter or allow more resource use? These are internal arguments within the conservation community for which we have almost no empirical evidence.”

The exhibition, Survival of the Slowest, will explore some animals that use their disadvantages to help the survive, and even thrive, in a world where large, strong and fast animals are commonly at the top of the food chain. The featured animals have evolved adaptations over millions of years to avoid becoming someone else’s lunch.

A dozen of them will be housed in natural-looking habitats that allow viewing up close and at length. They will include Linnaeus’s two-toed sloth, African pygmy hedgehog, veiled chameleon, green iguana, green basilisk, ball python and more.

Sloths, for example, grow algae on their fur which helps conceal them in the leafy forest. And being nocturnal helps sloths avoid their main predator, the harpy eagle, a daytime predator.

“As climate change and species extinction continue to alter our world, these amazing animals serve to reminds us of nature’s wonder and how much more we need to learn,” said Academy President and CEO Scott Cooper. “It’s more important than ever to connect people with nature and to inspire everyone to care for it.”

An animal keeper will be stationed in the exhibit to answer visitor questions, feed the animals and sometimes to remove an animal from its enclosure so visitors can have an even closer look.

Survival of the Slowest will be on view through September 20 at the Academy, which is the second U.S. showing. The first was the Brooklyn Children’s Museum in New York.

The exhibition is produced by Little Ray’s Nature Centres in Ottawa, in collaboration with the Canadian Museum of Nature. Little Ray’s is the largest exotic animal rescue organization in Canada and most of the animals in the exhibit are rescues.

Founded in 1812, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University is a leading natural history museum dedicated to advancing research, education and public engagement in biodiversity and environmental science.

Hours are 10 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Monday-Friday and 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Saturday-Sunday.

Siamang;Symphalangus syndactylus;Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand;Endangered;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Primates;Hylobatidae;Symphalangus;syndactylus;I;Indonesia,Malaysia,Thailand;;"JAKARTA (JAKARTA POST/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - In a rare incident that highlights the perils of the Indonesian government's infrastructure drive, a black-furred gibbon was electrocuted by a power line that had only recently been strung through a forest in Padang Lawas Utara regency in North Sumatra.

The siamang gibbon was found hanging on the electricity wire on Monday (March 25). Its body was still there a day later.

Residents of Aek Rao Tapian Nadenggan said it was the first time they had seen a gibbon die of electrocution since their village finally obtained access to electricity late last year.

""It is sad to see a dead siamang hanging on a power line,"" villager Sahnan said on Tuesday. ""This rare incident is the first since the power lines were erected in our village a few months ago.""

It is believed that the siamang gibbon was trying to cross a river in the forest by climbing the power lines.

""Electricity wires in the forest areas are very dangerous and could threaten the safety of the animals, particularly siamang gibbons that always climb trees,"" another villager Ahmadan told The Jakarta Post.

He called on the authorities to relocate the electricity wires that encroached into the habitat of the gibbons.

""We don't want to see more siamang gibbons die after climbing those electricity wires,"" he said.

PLN North Sumatra manager Tumpal Hutapea said that he was startled when he learnt that a siamang gibbon was killed by a power line the company had just put up.

""This is surprising to us,"" he told the Post.

The company, he said, would deploy a team to look into the matter.

""We will investigate the death of this siamang, including the erection of the power line that crosses the protected forest,"" he said, adding that the company would move the power line if it is proven to have violated existing regulations.

Great Indian Bustard;Ardeotis nigriceps;India, Nepal, Pakistan;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Gruiformes;Otididae;Ardeotis;nigriceps;I;India,Pakistan;;"Only one male has turned up at the birds’ breeding grounds this year — and he’s too young to breed.

Nearly 60 years ago the legendary ornithologist Sálim Ali made a bold proposition: A three-foot-tall bird known as the great Indian bustard, he suggested, should be named as the national bird of India.

At the time the great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) was already a legally protected endangered species, but its population — then estimated at just 1,250 birds — was still on the decline due to rampant poaching and loss of habitat. Giving the bird a national iconic distinction, Ali felt, would motivate efforts to conserve the species before its numbers shrank any further.

“The great Indian bustard is a species that merits this distinction,” Ali wrote in 1960. “It needs an urgent nationwide effort to save the bird from its impending doom.”

Unfortunately that never happened. India eventually did choose a national bird, but that honor went to the peacock, in part because it was better known and, reportedly, because government officials were afraid that people would mispronounce the bustard’s name as “bastard.”

Is the great Indian bustard now paying the price for that lost opportunity? This month scientists in India warned that the species is perilously close to extinction, with a remaining population of just 150 birds.

Even worse, this year researchers have observed just a single male bird — a juvenile too young to mate — at the bustards’ traditional breeding grounds in the Kutch district of the Indian state of Gujarat.

This youngster is the only male to visit the grassland site in some time. “No adult breeding males have been observed on their known breeding territories in last two years,” says Devesh Gadhvi, deputy director of the Corbett Foundation, a nonprofit engaged in great Indian bustard conservation efforts.

A few males have been previously confirmed in the neighboring state of Rajasthan, and Gadhvi says there may be a handful of additional males elsewhere in Gujarat, although there is no data to verify that.

So why has this massive species nearly died out? Sadly, it appears to be a case of decades of neglect, and in some cases outright hostility toward the species.

As Ali warned, the birds have lost most of their historic habitat — currently about 95 percent of where they used to fly — to roadways, mines, canals and other development. In addition, many projects have converted grasslands — which the Indian government classifies as “wasteland” — into wooded areas, inhospitable to the ground-dwelling species. Poaching has also continued to take a toll, especially on birds that have flown into neighboring Pakistan, where the species may or may not still exist.

Those decades were the primary reason for the bustards’ decline, but now a new threat has emerged. Critics say the most recent bustard population drops are due to India’s push for renewable energy.

Over the past few years, important bustard habitats in Gujarat, Rajasthan and other states have been crisscrossed with high-voltage power transmission lines, many of which transmit electricity from wind turbines. The Corbett Foundation has documented numerous cases where power lines have been built right next to bustard habitat or in their migratory pathways. Bustards have trouble avoiding these power lines due to their limited field of vision and heavy weight, which limits their maneuverability. At least 10 birds, possibly as many as 15, are known to have been electrocuted by those power lines over the past decade.

Among those killed were the only two males known to live in the state of Maharashtra. In the Gujarat region, Gadhvi says other males may have died “from colliding with the newly installed high-tension power lines right between their breeding and wintering ground.”

Renewable-energy projects in India do not require environmental impact assessments, a loophole that has left the birds particularly vulnerable even as the country races to build its energy capacity. India added nearly 12,000 megawatts of renewable-energy projects between April 2017 and March 2018 and plans to add another 175,000 by the year 2022.

Can the energy grid be made safer for the bustard? “There has to be a will and there has to be a way,” says Valli Bindana, director of the new documentary SunGanges, about the environmental impacts of India’s energy policies. “People elsewhere have made grids ‘avian safe.’ Perhaps we need to borrow expertise. But whatever has to be done has to be done quickly.”

With this critically endangered species facing an uncertain future, experts and advocates from numerous conservation groups have called on the Indian government to do something wile there is still a great Indian bustard to protect. “These issues have been raised with the hon’ble Prime Minister of India…and the State Government of Gujarat but except [for] lip service none have taken this matter seriously,” the Corbett Foundation wrote recently on Facebook. “It is a national shame that we are allowing this species to go extinct despite knowing what should and can be done to prevent this.”

Named “Alberta”, the 32-year-old western gorilla spent nearly its entire life at the zoo’s Safari Park division and was hand-raised by animal care staff, said zoo official Jenny Mehlow.

The animal was one of six gorillas at the park, Mehlow said.

Alberta was born in 1979 at the Fresno Zoo before coming to the Safari Park and Mehlow added that western gorillas are considered to be critically endangered, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Before her death, Alberta was the mother of three infants born in 1988, 1996 and 1992 and was said to have “adopted” a baby gorilla from another mother.

A necropsy will be performed to determine just what happened to Alberta.

Officials said the animal was recently being monitored by veterinary and animal care staff for shoulder issues.

Gray langur;Semnopithecus hector;Bhutan, India, Nepal;Near Threatened;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Primates;Cercopithecidae;Semnopithecus;hector;I;India,Nepal;;"More than half of the world’s monkeys, apes, lemurs, and other primates are now threatened by extinction, a group of international conservationists reported on Tuesday.

The group, led by scientists at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, released its updated Primates in Peril report, stressing that to reverse the losses of man’s closest relative, humans must reverse the course of large-scale habitat destruction (particularly forest burning and clearing); stop hunting primates for food; and halt the illegal wildlife trade.

“We are currently re-assessing all primates and there is great concern that the situation may be getting even worse for many of these iconic and important species,” Simon Stuart, chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, said in a statement.

The report is updated every two years and highlights the 25 primates most susceptible to extinction—five from biodiverse Madagascar, five from Africa, 10 from Asia, and five from Central and South America.

“Some of these animals have tiny populations remaining in the wild,” Christoph Schwitzer, director of conservation at Bristol Zoological Society, said in a statement. “Support and action to help save them is vital if we are to avoid losing these wonderful animals forever.”

Some species singled out in the report include the Hainan gibbon—only 25 of which are thought to remain in the wild—and Madagascar’s northern sportive lemurs, of which only 50 remain in their native habitat.

While there are new additions to the updated list, including the Lavasoa Mountains dwarf lemur—an undiscovered species until two years ago—a species’ falling off the list doesn’t indicate it is faring any better.

“The changes made in this list compared to the previous iteration (2012–2014) were not because the situation of the species that were dropped has improved,” the report stated. “In some cases, such as...Microcebus berthae [Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur], the situation has in fact worsened, due to ongoing deforestation in this species’ small distribution range in western Madagascar. By making these changes, we intend rather to highlight other, closely related species enduring equally bleak prospects for their future survival.”

Russell Mittermeier, chair of the IUCN Primate Specialist Group, said he hopes the report encourages governments to commit to biodiversity conservation measures.

“There is increasing evidence that certain species may play a key role in dispersing the seeds of tropical forest tree species that have a critically important role in mitigating climate change—a particularly noteworthy consideration given the upcoming conference of the parties of the climate convention in Paris,” Mittermeier said in a statement.

Below is a list of the 25 most endangered primates compiled in the 2014–16 report and their estimated populations in the wild.

 Grey Dolphin;Sotalia fluviatilis;Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of);Data Deficient;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Cetacea;Delphinidae;Sotalia;fluviatilis;I;Brazil,Colombia,Ecuador,Peru;;"There was a stretch of time when Henry VIII was madly in love with Anne Boleyn, the woman he made his second wife. In the year before the king married Anne, they were together much of the time, and one of their “love nests” is now up for sale for $3 million (£2.5 million).

Shurland Hall, a 16th century Grade II listed house, was owned by one of the king’s courtiers, Thomas Cheyne, and he hosted Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn at his home for three days in the autumn of 1532.

Afterward, the royal party left for France, where they met with Francis I in Calais.

On the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, southeast England, Shurland Hall currently has almost 10,000 square feet of living space and the medieval gatehouse offers three bathrooms, four reception rooms, a converted barn with kitchen, WC, and bar.

Its distinctive octagonal towers and battlements resemble the Tudor Palace gatehouse at Hampton Court.

According to the Daily Mail, “Wrought iron entrance gates hung upon stone pillars give way to a sweeping tree lined driveway, passing a beautiful boating lake en-route to a parking area.”

The house was built on the site of a 13th century castle owned by the de Shurland family. In fact, Sir Robert de Shurland is featured in the Ingoldsby legend of Grey Dolphin.

Long after the Tudors, it was requisitioned during the Second World War. Following that, it fell into ruin, and was only saved by the Spitalfields Trust in 2006 with a grant from English Heritage and a loan from the Architectural Heritage Fund, according to Kent Online.

It is currently home to retired advertising executive Dan Donoghue and his wife Suzanne who run a champagne importing business called Andromeda Boru. Estate agents Fine and Country from West Malling are marketing it as “one of the region’s finest homes.”

While the house is being billed as a place where Henry VIII “courted” Anne Boleyn, the courting was well established by the autumn of 1532, with the two of them most likely secretly engaged.

When Henry VIII began his famous pursuit of Anne Boleyn is unknown, but historians’ best estimate is 1526. Henry VIII had been married to Catherine of Aragon, a Spanish princess previously married to his older brother Arthur, since 1509.

He had taken mistresses before, including Anne’s sister, Mary Boleyn, but decided that he wanted to marry Anne, who was described as “rather tall of stature, with black hair and an oval face of sallow complexion… She was handsome to look at, with a pretty mouth.”

In 1527 King Henry told Catherine, his wife of many years, that he wanted an annulment. She refused to cooperate in any way, and her nephew, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, supported her in her efforts to retain her rights as queen. The pope, under pressure from Charles V, would not grant Henry VIII his annulment, leading him to break with the Catholic Church.

By 1532, Henry was moving toward making himself head of the Church of England, which Anne Boleyn, a religious reformer, supported.

Anne is supposed to have refused to sleep with the king until they were married, but it’s believed that they began to share a bed during the trip to Calais. It is even possible that the couple were intimate at Shurland Hall. They were definitely besotted. They married in secret in early 1532 and the future Elizabeth I was born on September 7, 1533.

Less than three years later, Anne Boleyn was dead, executed for treason and adultery.

Thomas Cheyne began his service to the royals with Henry VII and amazingly he served every Tudor monarch. He was knighted in 1513 and was a favorite of Anne Boleyn, who fought Cardinal Wolsey for his promotion in 1528 and 1529. He died in 1559, just at the beginning of the reign of Anne’s daughter, Elizabeth.

Cheyne served as an ambassador to France three times between 1549 and 1553.

According to On the Tudor Trail, Cheyne was almost bankrupted by the cost of Henry and Anne’s visit in 1532. A visit from the king was a great honor but it also meant a visit from the 300 or so people in the king’s retinue.

Researchers from China found that the animals are indeed natural hosts for various coronaviruses, but do not appear to be the direct source of COVID-19.

Experts believe that the coronavirus presently sweeping the globe originated in bats — but likely spread to humans via another, intermediary, animal host.

Identifying this intermediate will be key to controlling the novel coronavirus and preventing additional spillovers of it — and other coronaviruses — in the future.

The scaly anteater-like creatures known as pangolins are not to blame for spreading coronavirus from bats to humans, a study concluded. Pictured, a mother and baby pangolin

In their study, Ping Liu of the Guangdong Academy of Science in China and colleagues sequenced the whole genome of a coronavirus identified in two groups of sick Malayan pangolins.

The team's data confirmed that the pangolin coronavirus is genetically associated with both SARS-CoV-2 — the novel virus behind the current pandemic — and a group of bat coronaviruses.

However, the researchers' analysis suggested that SARS-CoV-2 did not arise directly from the pangolin coronavirus, as had previously been suspected.

The researchers have cautioned, however, that even if pangolins were not an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that other coronaviruses could be circulating within the animals.

Such, they added, presents the risk that these other coronaviruses could spill over from the pangolins into humans.

Conservation and limited exposure to wildlife will be important to minimise this risk, the team recommended.

In their study, Ping Liu of the Guangdong Academy of Science in China and colleagues sequenced the whole genome of a coronavirus identified in sick Malayan pangolins

Agile Gibbon;Hylobates agilis;Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand;Endangered;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Primates;Hylobatidae;Hylobates;agilis;I;Indonesia,Malaysia,Thailand;;"FOTA Wildlife Park has another new arrival to celebrate with the birth of a baby agile gibbon.

The as yet unnamed monkey was born on August 27 to mum Chloe, who is aged 18 and ten years younger than dad Conor.

3 The gender of the baby is not yet known

The baby has not been named as mum Chloe is keeping it very close and rangers can't get close enough to determine its gender.

Lead Ranger Teresa Power said: “We are delighted to announce the birth of this new agile gibbon. This species is listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which makes their breeding success in Fota all the more important.

""The group of agile gibbons here at Fota have been established since the 1990s and Fota is one of the few wildlife parks worldwide to successfully breed this species in captivity.”

""New mother Chloe arrived here in 2008 and has since bred successfully with Conor.

""Their daughter Billie - older sister to the new baby, left for Parc Safari in Montreal last year and we hope that she will be as successful a breeder as her parents.”

3 Mother Chloe with newborn baby

""As the name suggests this gibbon is extremely fast, agile and acrobatic and is native to the rain forests of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand.""

The agile gibbon is also known as the black-handed gibbon.

A male is distinguishable from his female counterpart by the white or light-grey cheek fur on his face. Both have white eyebrows and, like other gibbons, don’t have tails.

The agile gibbon family live in a specially constructed island habitat in the Asian Sanctuary at Fota.

3 The baby will be named by a member of the public

The Asian Sanctuary is also home to other endangered and critically endangered species such as the Asiatic lion, the Indian rhino and the Sumatran tiger to name a few.

 Komodo Monitor;Varanus komodoensis;Indonesia;Vulnerable;2020-06-18;Animalia;Reptilia;Sauria;Varanidae;Varanus;komodoensis;I;Indonesia;;"Advertisement

Startling images from Indonesia captured the moment a ravenous Komodo dragon placed its entire head into the mouth of his bigger and potentially deadly reptile pal in a fierce battle over a deer carcass.

The giant lizards, which can only be found on a few Indonesian islands, are renowned for their feisty temper and insatiable appetite and these photos show the lengths a dragon will go to get a meal.

Russian photographer Andrey Gudkov, 44, from Moscow visited Rinca Island, close to Komodo island, recently and caught the sharp teethed beasts battling out for a new kill.

It seems the brave dragon avoided serious injury in its daring move to to appease his appetite. Considering the lizards have poisonous saliva and have been noted for cannibalistic tendencies this boy was very lucky to escape unscathed.

Mine! A Komodo dragon attempts to escape the advances of other hungry lizards who have their eyes firmly on the deer carcass lodged in its mouth

Its attempt to have a meal for one is thwarted by two rambunctious dragons who close in on the deer and its current holder

It is no use. A flailing attempt to protect its dinner is useless as its adversaries, smelling suculent blood, edge ever closer to the dead deer

Owing to their size, Komodo dragons will take on a number of animals. They have been known to feed on carrion (decaying flesh), deer, pigs, buffalo and even smaller dragons. Be careful, as they have also been known to attack humans although killings are extremely rare

The scramble begins. The original carrier of the meat is forced to share its meal with the other dragons who are quick to bloody their snouts in the carnage

There have been reported cases of lizards digging up human graves with their sharp claws in order to gnaw on human flesh

The Komodo has a unique if grim method of killing its prey. Upon pouncing on its victim it will attempt to devour it in one session. However if the animal is able to flee the attack it will still be condemned to death. The dragon's possess poisonous saliva, containing 50 strains of bacteria that will give its prey blood poisoning. The lizards follow the bitten animal until it drops dead around 24 hours later and then feast on the fallen victim

Any more? This brave Komodo places its head in his friend's mouth looking for more scraps of meat to satisfy its great appetite. This lizard could have had its head ripped off but it seems he caught his pal in a good mood

There are around 3,000 to 5,000 Komodo dragons on the islands of Komodo, Gila Motang, Rinca, and Flores. However the number is falling owing to a dearth of egg-laying females, poaching, human encroachment, and natural disasters. They are now considered an endangered status, according to the National Geographic

Hanging around. Reaching up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length and more than 300 pounds (136 kilograms), Komodo dragons are the heaviest lizards on Earth and a formidable opponent for much larger animals

Like looking through a time warp. The dragons could be closest living creature to the dinosaurs. Fossils of a very similar species found in Australia suggest the Komodo dragon could have been on the earth for around 3.8 million years, long before humans dominated the earth

If the Komodo loses track of an animal it has bitten and subsequently killed it will use its incredible sense of smell to find it and then devour its flesh for a tasty snack

According to the Smithsonian Zoo, Komodo dragons, like snakes, use their forked tongues to sample the air, and then touch the tongue to the roof of their mouth, where special organs analyze the airborne molecules

Despite now being synonymous with Indonesia no Western scientists had seen a Komodo dragon until 1912, according to the San Diego Zoo. They got their name after rumours suggested a beast like creature lived on the island of Komodo although they are also found in the Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar islands";Komodo dragon sticks its head inside another one’s mouth to snatch its food;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMzc4MTQ2Ny9XaGF0LXMtamF3cy1Lb21vZG8tZHJhZ29uLXN0aWNrcy1oZWFkLWluc2lkZS1vbmUtcy1tb3V0aC1zbmF0Y2gtZm9vZC5odG1s0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFpbHltYWlsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvYXJ0aWNsZS0zNzgxNDY3L2FtcC9XaGF0LXMtamF3cy1Lb21vZG8tZHJhZ29uLXN0aWNrcy1oZWFkLWluc2lkZS1vbmUtcy1tb3V0aC1zbmF0Y2gtZm9vZC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/09/09/12/381E5C5C00000578-0-image-a-72_1473419045341.jpg;2016-09-09;"[{'sent': 'Startling images from Indonesia', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Indonesia']}}, {'sent': 'captured the moment a ravenous Komodo dragon placed its entire head into the mouth of his bigger and potentially deadly reptile pal in a fierce battle over a deer carcass.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'Russian photographer Andrey Gudkov, 44, from Moscow visited Rinca Island, close to Komodo island, recently and caught the sharp teethed beasts battling out for a new kill.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Andrey Gudkov'], 'GPE': ['Moscow', 'Rinca Island']}}, {'sent': 'A Komodo dragon attempts to escape the advances of other hungry lizards who have their eyes firmly on the deer carcass lodged in its mouth\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'Its attempt to have a meal for one is thwarted by two rambunctious dragons who close in on the deer and its current holder\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'Owing to their size, Komodo dragons will take on a number of animals.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'The Komodo has a unique if grim method of killing its prey.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'Upon pouncing on its victim it will attempt to devour it in one session.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': ""The dragon's possess poisonous saliva, containing 50 strains of bacteria that will give its prey blood poisoning."", 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['50']}}, {'sent': ""This brave Komodo places its head in his friend's mouth looking for more scraps of meat to satisfy its great appetite."", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'There are around 3,000 to 5,000 Komodo dragons on the islands of Komodo, Gila Motang, Rinca, and Flores.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['around 3,000 to 5,000'], 'ORG': ['Komodo'], 'PERSON': ['Gila Motang', 'Rinca', 'Flores']}}, {'sent': 'They are now considered an endangered status, according to the National Geographic\n\nHanging around.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the National Geographic']}}, {'sent': 'Reaching up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length and more than 300 pounds (136 kilograms), Komodo dragons are the heaviest lizards on Earth and a formidable opponent for much larger animals\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['136 kilograms', '3 meters', 'more than 300 pounds', 'up to 10 feet'], 'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'Fossils of a very similar species found in Australia suggest the Komodo dragon could have been on the earth for around 3.8 million years, long before humans dominated the earth\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Australia'], 'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'If the Komodo loses track of an animal it has bitten and subsequently killed it will use its incredible sense of smell to find it and then devour its flesh for a tasty snack\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo']}}, {'sent': 'According to the Smithsonian Zoo, Komodo dragons, like snakes, use their forked tongues to sample the air, and then touch the tongue to the roof of their mouth, where special organs analyze the airborne molecules\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo', 'the Smithsonian Zoo']}}, {'sent': 'Despite now being synonymous with Indonesia no Western scientists had seen a Komodo dragon until 1912, according to the San Diego Zoo.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Indonesia'], 'ORG': ['Komodo', 'the San Diego Zoo']}}, {'sent': 'They got their name after rumours suggested a beast like creature lived on the island of Komodo although they are also found in the Rinca, Flores, Gili Motang, and Padar islands', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Rinca', 'Flores', 'Gili Motang']}}]";Negative

They make regular guest appearances on television and often show face at events around town.

Now they are beginning a six month stint with Dutch art duo, Bik Van der Pol, at the Pérez Art Museum in downtown Miami, in a new installation called Speechless.

The artists, Liesbeth Bik and Jos Van der Pol, have specially designed and built an aviary for the exhibition, which focuses on ecological concerns. They have taught the parrots to recite T.S. Eliot’s “The Waste Land,” 434 lines that come together to form the Holy Grail of modern poetry.

The birds are free to fly around their cage and perch on capital letters that spell out GLOBAL WARMING, CLIMATE CHANGE and SUSTAINABILITY.

When the parrots’ first class vet and caretaker aren’t around, museum staff and volunteers, who have been trained to take care of the birds, will feed them and clean up after them.

The museum answered a list of FAQs for worried locals and bird lovers, assuring those concerned that the birds would be in safe hands even during a hurricane. For instance, “in the event of an emergency or natural disaster, the parrots will be taken to a safe and appropriate environment,” it states on the page.

Following the exhibition, the animals will return to their Miami home. The FAQ page informs a disappointed public that the feathered quintet can be neither bought nor adopted.

These extraordinary creatures are our closest relatives, sharing 97% of our DNA. Their similarity to us is astonishing. They are intelligent, inquisitive, smile and show empathy. They even laugh when tickled, like us, when most other animals have evolved to be ticklish only in an itchy, irritating sort of way as a protective reflex. Encountering orangutans in the wild is like nothing else I’ve experienced.

They once thrived in Indonesia’s lush, green rainforests but over the last 50 years they have been forced from their home and killed. In the last 16 years alone, 100,000 Bornean orangutans have been lost. All three species – Bornean, Sumatran and the Tapanuli, a species discovered only last year – are now on the critically endangered list. The reason? It started in the 1960s as forests were logged for timber, but now it’s palm oil.

Indonesia is burning. So why is the world looking away? | George Monbiot Read more

Global demand for palm oil has increased six-fold since 1990. It’s in half of all packaged products on supermarket shelves and to avoid it completely would be incredibly tricky. Although palm oil in food can no longer be described simply as vegetable oil and must be clearly labelled (thanks to an EU directive in 2014), there is no such law for products such as soap, shampoo and other cosmetics. The supermarket Iceland’s decision to ditch palm oil from all of its own-brand products was, it says, a response to the palm oil industry’s catastrophic failure to halt deforestation and deal with the problem.

Even the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) – the industry body charged with ensuring registered companies trade only in oil that has not come from deforestation – is failing spectacularly. Just over a week ago, Greenpeace exposed massive rainforest destruction in Papua allegedly caused by palm oil companies that are subsidiaries of a current RSPO member. Buying from them were big multinationals including Unilever, Nestlé, Pepsico and Mars. The companies concerned have responded by saying they are taking Greenpeace’s claims seriously and taking appropriate action. But if Greenpeace’s assertions are correct, no company can claim the palm oil it uses is 100% “sustainable”.

Red Ape reveals the truly remarkable work that International Animal Rescue workers are doing on the ground to save these animals. At this crucial stage in their existence, every life saved is vital to their survival. But if we want to save orangutans in the long term, as John Sauven, Greenpeace UK’s executive director, says in the programme, we must save their home – the rainforest. You can sign Greenpeace UK’s petition to support this mission.

Orangutans spend 95% of their lives in the trees, but right now, Indonesia’s forests are disappearing at the rate of one football pitch every 25 seconds. In the absence of industry reform, multinationals such as those mentioned above must take responsibility. In fact, back in 2010 they actually promised to take responsibility. Then, members of the Consumer Goods Forum pledged that by 2020 they would no longer buy palm oil from any company that decreased the net amount of rainforest. But have they done anything about it? Not much, it seems. In fact, in January this year, when Greenpeace asked 16 companies to publish which palm oil traders they were buying from, many refused – although not those listed above.

New species of orangutan discovered in Sumatra – and is already endangered Read more

With rainforest clearance continuing and the Indonesian government boasting a projected increase in palm oil production from 36.5m tonnes in 2017 to over 42m tonnes by 2020, the situation really is dire. And it’s not just orangutans that are threatened. More than 69% of Sumatran elephant habitat has been destroyed within one generation, and there are fewer than 100 Sumatran rhinos left in the wild. People are part of this conflict too. Land grabbing and exploitation of workers, including the use of child labour, is endemic. And decades of deforestation for palm oil have created conditions ideal for furious forest and peatland fires. These fires, often deliberately started by companies clearing the land, threaten the health of people across southeast Asia and drive climate change.

Indeed, if nothing is done, eventually we will all pay the price, since land-use change, mainly from tropical deforestation, accounts for 12% of global carbon emissions. Keeping these forests intact really is vital for all life on Earth. There can be no more delaying until the next decade. 2020 is less than two years away and the burden of responsibility lies firmly with the multinationals. Palm oil can be produced without destroying rainforests but only if big companies support it. I won’t let them forget their zero-deforestation promise. Will you?

He had two suitcases crammed with 55 live turtles, and he was hoping to make a sale.

He watched as his customer, a man wearing shorts and sneakers, carefully examined the reptiles crawling across the hotel rug.

Bakrudin Ali Ahamed Habeeb, had posted on Facebook some seven months earlier that he had reptiles to sell, triggering a flurry of text messages and price negotiations. Now, Habeeb just needed to prove that his animals were in good health so he could pass them off into the exotic pet trade.

It was May 2017, and he was anticipating a big payday.

When his visitor left the room, ostensibly to get a colleague, Habeeb didn’t even look up. But minutes later, agents from Malaysia’s department of wildlife and parks flooded his room. The would-be buyer, as it turned out, was an undercover agent with the Wildlife Justice Commission, a Hague-based nonprofit that works to expose the criminal networks behind the illegal wildlife trade. Local law enforcement officers had been waiting in the next room to nab Habeeb as he made an illegal sale of black spotted turtles, which are found in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh and are barred from international trade because of the species’ protected designation under international law.

Based on the evidence provided by the Wildlife Justice Commission and described in a report published December 6, Habeeb—an Indian national who had long been smuggling reptiles from India to Malaysia—was sentenced to 24 months in prison. He was one of 30 individuals arrested during a two-year investigation by the commission into reptile smuggling.

The investigation led to the seizure of more than 6,000 turtles and tortoises—many of them endangered species. Thirty people were arrested for smuggling these reptiles through Malaysia, India, or Bangladesh. Five of those individuals, all in Malaysia, have already been convicted and are serving prison sentences.

In the most extreme case, “over a thousand Indian star tortoises were seized in one sting operation in Kuala Lumpur, and two people were arrested,” says Sarah Stoner, senior investigations manager at the Wildlife Justice Commission and lead author of the report. One of those men is now serving 24 months in prison. The other failed to show up in court, and there’s an outstanding warrant for his arrest.

The commission’s investigations focused primarily on Southeast Asia, the pet trade destination for many of these turtles and tortoises, but it also encompassed areas as far-flung as Cameroon and the Netherlands. Collectively, according to the commission, the turtles offered to the agents were worth $3 million wholesale and much more on the retail market.

WHERE TRAFFICKING OCCURS For two years, the Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC) sent investigators undercover to gather information about the illegal turtle and tortoise trade. By posing as buyers, they gained access to trafficking networks. WJC’s findings helped local law enforcement officials seize thousands of animals and arrest traffickers.

Dozens of investigators, analysts, and undercover workers found that in most cases the turtles and tortoises were being smuggled from India, Pakistan, and Madagascar to buyers in mainland China and Hong Kong. Top species offered included ones that are considered vulnerable because of their dwindling numbers, such as the Indian star tortoise and the black spotted turtle. Investigators were also offered more than 1,500 radiated tortoises—a species native to Madagascar that’s considered critically endangered and is prohibited from any commercial trade under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, the agreement that regulates the wildlife trade. (Read about the 10,000 radiated tortoises found in a house in Madagascar in April.)

The report also revealed details about the scale and coordination of the corruption that greases these trades. Airports the animals were most often trafficked through were pinpointed, as were local sources of some of the reptiles. To do that work, the group used the plans smugglers shared with the commission’s “buyers”—describing how products would be moved from one area to another—and compared them against intelligence on meager arrest records at those transit points, essentially corroborating that someone was likely being paid to look the other way.

 Owl parrot;Strigops habroptila;New Zealand;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Psittaciformes;Psittacidae;Strigops;habroptila;I;New Zealand;;"The kakapo (Strigops habroptila), a parrot native to New Zealand, just may be the world’s strangest bird. Giant and flightless, with an owlish face, it lives up to its Maori name, which translates to “night parrot.” When kakapos emerge each night from their hidden daytime roosts, they plod across the fern-laced forest floor, or use their powerful feet to climb into the tree canopy in search of fruits, seeds, tubers, flowers, shoots, and leaves. In austral summer (December through February), male kakapos gather at display areas, called leks, to compete for mates, and their booming calls can be heard reverberating through the forest for miles around. Those calls, which today are few and far between, might have gone completely silent had it not been for the efforts of a handful of scientists and volunteers desperately working to save the species.

Eaten almost to extinction by invasive predators, a mere 18 kakapos remained on Earth by the mid-1970s. But intensive human intervention over the past few decades—including the relocation of the remaining birds to predator-controlled offshore islands and the hand-rearing of chicks—has swelled kakapo numbers to more than 150 today. Biologists are more hopeful than ever that the species will recover. Yet that fate is far from assured.

Nurturing the population toward recovery requires costly round-the-clock attention during the nesting season. And now the birds have become numerous enough on the three islands where they’ve been relocated that they’re beginning to run out of space. As reported in this week’s bioGraphic feature “Eradication Nation,” New Zealand conservation biologists are pinning their hopes on an ambitious initiative to create new isolated safe havens for kakapos and other endangered native species—and eventually, to eradicate invasive predators across the mainland.";Kakapo Comeback;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiK2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb2dyYXBoaWMuY29tL2tha2Fwby1jb21lYmFjay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.biographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9-31-49_SMB_20110702_080.jpg;2017-11-14;[{'sent': 'The kakapo (Strigops habroptila), a parrot native to New Zealand, just may be the world’s strangest bird.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['New Zealand']}}, {'sent': 'When kakapos emerge each night from their hidden daytime roosts, they plod across the fern-laced forest floor, or use their powerful feet to climb into the tree canopy in search of fruits, seeds, tubers, flowers, shoots, and leaves.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['kakapos emerge each night']}}, {'sent': 'In austral summer (December through February), male kakapos gather at display areas, called leks, to compete for mates, and their booming calls can be heard reverberating through the forest for miles around.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['kakapos gather', 'leks']}}, {'sent': 'Eaten almost to extinction by invasive predators, a mere 18 kakapos remained on Earth by the mid-1970s.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['18'], 'GPE': ['kakapos']}}, {'sent': 'But intensive human intervention over the past few decades—including the relocation of the remaining birds to predator-controlled offshore islands and the hand-rearing of chicks—has swelled kakapo numbers to more than 150 today.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['kakapo'], 'CARDINAL': ['more than 150']}}, {'sent': 'And now the birds have become numerous enough on the three islands where they’ve been relocated that they’re beginning to run out of space.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['three']}}, {'sent': 'bioGraphic feature “Eradication Nation,” New Zealand conservation biologists are pinning their hopes on an ambitious initiative to create new isolated safe havens for kakapos and other endangered native species—and eventually, to eradicate invasive predators across the mainland.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['kakapos', 'New Zealand']}}];Positive
Geometric Tortoise;Psammobates geometricus;South Africa;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Reptilia;Testudines;Testudinidae;Psammobates;geometricus;I;South Africa;;"Countries around the globe are observing Endangered Species Month, and taking stock of the successes achieved and work left to be done in the fight to protect endangered, threatened and at-risk species.

“The global fight against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is ushering in a new era of cooperation among nations. Hopefully, this collaborative spirit also spreads to other areas requiring a concerted worldwide effort to battle wildlife trafficking, poaching, and the destruction of the habitat of at-risk species, which all emanate in the decimation of wildlife populations globally,” said Matt Robertson, Veterinarian at Orijen South Africa, which sponsors dog food for the project.

As part of the College’s learning by doing approach to training and since becoming operational in February 2019, these free tracking dogs have saved approximately 45 rhinos and have led to arrests of over 140 poachers.

“Orijen South Africa is proud to be partnering with the Southern African Wildlife College in support of its four-tiered approach to counter-poaching, which includes well-trained field rangers, a K9 capacity, aerial support as well as community engagement. The tiers are symbiotic, but the game-changer has been the free-running dogs. The dogs are able to track poachers down at much faster speeds than any human can while using their incredible sense of smell to stay on track,” says Robertson.

The company also supports the CapeNature Conservation Detection Dog project, which helps conserve the critically endangered geometric tortoise, Psammobates geometricus, that became endangered due to competition for habitat with development and agriculture.

This field of canine conservation detection is highly specialised and is a novel approach locally, in fact, this specific project is the first live target conservation detection work operational within South Africa.

“Detection dogs Brin and Jamie have found thousands of tortoises over a seven-year period across the Western Cape. Both dogs are trained to find no less than five species of tortoises, each of which have their own unique scent and have also been trained to locate the critically endangered toadlet (Rose’s mountain toadlet).

“These four-legged conservation heroes have participated in numerous search and rescue operations, salvaging tortoises from death by fire, lack of food and water from the drought and even bulldozers when a piece of land they live on is being developed,” said Vicki Hudson, Conservation Intelligence Manager at the CapeNature Conservation Detection project.

Pack Leader, via its Orijen brand also supports Endangered Wildlife Trust’s Drylands Conservation Programme, which sees Specialist Conservation Officer, Esther Matthew, and her trusty partner Jessie the Border Collie, scent detection dog, on a mission to save some of South Africa’s critically endangered species.

Matthew explained that Jessie has been used to find African Giant Bullfrogs (Pyxicephalus adspersus) underground and is currently being used to find the Critically Endangered Riverine Rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis). Some of their future conservation research projects will include the Golden Mole and the Karoo Dwarf tortoise.

“Through our support of these crucial local initiatives and the brave men, women and four-legged conservation heroes helping to save South Africa’s natural heritage, we hope to play a part in helping to preserve these species for generations to come,” said Robertson.";A nose for conservation;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmdyb2NvdHRzLmNvLnphLzIwMjAvMDUvMjEvYS1ub3NlLWZvci1jb25zZXJ2YXRpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.grocotts.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image002-1.jpg;2020-05-21;[{'sent': '“The global fight against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is ushering in a new era of cooperation among nations.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Coronavirus']}}, {'sent': 'Hopefully, this collaborative spirit also spreads to other areas requiring a concerted worldwide effort to battle wildlife trafficking, poaching, and the destruction of the habitat of at-risk species, which all emanate in the decimation of wildlife populations globally,” said Matt Robertson, Veterinarian at Orijen South Africa, which sponsors dog food for the project.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Matt Robertson'], 'ORG': ['Veterinarian']}}, {'sent': 'As part of the College’s learning by doing approach to training and since becoming operational in February 2019, these free tracking dogs have saved approximately 45 rhinos and have led to arrests of over 140 poachers.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['College'], 'CARDINAL': ['140', '45']}}, {'sent': '“Orijen South Africa is proud to be partnering with the Southern African Wildlife College in support of its four-tiered approach to counter-poaching, which includes well-trained field rangers, a K9 capacity, aerial support as well as community engagement.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Southern African Wildlife College', 'Orijen South Africa'], 'CARDINAL': ['four']}}, {'sent': 'The dogs are able to track poachers down at much faster speeds than any human can while using their incredible sense of smell to stay on track,” says Robertson.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Robertson']}}, {'sent': 'This field of canine conservation detection is highly specialised and is a novel approach locally, in fact, this specific project is the first live target conservation detection work operational within South Africa.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['South Africa']}}, {'sent': '“Detection dogs Brin and Jamie have found thousands of tortoises over a seven-year period across the Western Cape.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jamie', 'Brin'], 'CARDINAL': ['thousands']}}, {'sent': 'Both dogs are trained to find no less than five species of tortoises, each of which have their own unique scent and have also been trained to locate the critically endangered toadlet (Rose’s mountain toadlet).\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['no less than five']}}, {'sent': '“These four-legged conservation heroes have participated in numerous search and rescue operations, salvaging tortoises from death by fire, lack of food and water from the drought and even bulldozers when a piece of land they live on is being developed,” said Vicki Hudson, Conservation Intelligence Manager at the CapeNature Conservation Detection project.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['four'], 'PERSON': ['Vicki Hudson'], 'ORG': ['the CapeNature Conservation Detection']}}, {'sent': 'Pack Leader, via its Orijen brand also supports Endangered Wildlife Trust’s Drylands Conservation Programme, which sees Specialist Conservation Officer, Esther Matthew, and her trusty partner Jessie', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Endangered Wildlife Trust', 'Orijen'], 'PERSON': ['Esther Matthew']}}, {'sent': 'the Border Collie, scent detection dog, on a mission to save some of South Africa’s critically endangered species.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Border Collie'], 'GPE': ['South Africa']}}, {'sent': 'Matthew explained that Jessie has been used to find African Giant Bullfrogs (Pyxicephalus adspersus) underground and is currently being used to find the Critically Endangered Riverine Rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis).', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jessie', 'Matthew']}}, {'sent': '“Through our support of these crucial local initiatives and the brave men, women and four-legged conservation heroes helping to save South Africa’s natural heritage, we hope to play a part in helping to preserve these species for generations to come,” said Robertson.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['four'], 'GPE': ['South Africa'], 'PERSON': ['Robertson']}}];Positive

For more than 20 years, Brook the sea otter drew crowds to watch as she frolicked around with longtime companion, Charlie, at the Aquarium of the Pacific.

The Long Beach aquarium on Wednesday announced Brook, who had recently been diagnosed with congestive heart failure by the aquarium’s veterinary team, had died a day earlier on Jan. 29.

Born in 1997, Brook was 21 and was considered the oldest living female southern sea otter in an aquarium or zoo.

Brook, as a 1-year-old pup, was one of the first sea critters brought to the aquarium in 1998, before the aquarium was open to the public.

“She was known for her photogenic looks and regal demeanor, which secured her place in the hearts of many during her 20 years at the Aquarium,” reads a statement about her death. “She will be greatly missed.”

Long-time Aquarium volunteer and blogger Hugh Ryono recently posted a video of Brook and Charlie as pups frolicking in the Aquarium’s sea otter habitat in 1998.

A memory book has been created for the public to share memories or give donations in her honor.

Sea otters, which once roamed the area in great numbers, are a rare sight after they were nearly hunted to extinction.

Biologists believe that at one time, between 16,000 and 20,000 sea otters could be found along the coast between Baja California and the Pacific Northwest, according to the aquarium’s website.

Sea otters disappeared from the area for several reasons.

First, they were overhunted. The fur trade from the late 1700s to early 1900s nearly brought the animals to extinction, but a colony of about 50 otters was discovered in 1938 in a cove near the Bixby Bridge in Big Sur.

With protection from the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, sea otters were granted protection from trapping. They were listed as an endangered species in 1973.

Then, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service implemented a program in 1987 that introduced a small species of otters to San Nicolas Island, which is part of California’s Channel Islands, in an effort to protect the federally threatened sea otter.

As part of that program, “no otter zones” were set up, which meant any otters found south of Santa Barbara County were relocated to the north. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service terminated the program in December 2012, allowing the otters to swim in their natural range, which was expected to boost recovery of the species.

At that time, the population was estimated at 2,792, according to a 2012 U.S. Geological Survey. In 2014, that number rose to 2,944.

Occasionally, sea otters are spotted off the Southern California coastline.

A whale-watching boat from Dana Wharf saw an otter off the coast of Laguna in December 2011. It was their first sighting in 30 years.

Then, there were a few sightings in 2013 near Huntington Harbour and the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge, and in 2016 images showed a sea otter hanging out off Crystal Cove.";Well-known sea otter Brook dies at Aquarium of the Pacific at 21;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzdGVsZWdyYW0uY29tL3dlbGwta25vd24tc2VhLW90dGVyLWJyb29rLWRpZXMtYXQtYXF1YXJpdW0tb2YtdGhlLXBhY2lmaWMtYXQtMjHSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVzc3RlbGVncmFtLmNvbS8yMDE5LzAxLzMwL3dlbGwta25vd24tc2VhLW90dGVyLWJyb29rLWRpZXMtYXQtYXF1YXJpdW0tb2YtdGhlLXBhY2lmaWMtYXQtMjEvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.presstelegram.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/0131_NWS_LPT-L-OTTER-0131-1.jpg187-1.jpg?w=770&h=513;2019-01-30;[{'sent': 'For more than 20 years, Brook the sea otter drew crowds to watch as she frolicked around with longtime companion, Charlie, at the Aquarium of the Pacific.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Charlie']}}, {'sent': 'The Long Beach aquarium on Wednesday announced Brook, who had recently been diagnosed with congestive heart failure by the aquarium’s veterinary team, had died a day earlier on Jan. 29.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Long Beach'], 'PERSON': ['Brook']}}, {'sent': 'Born in 1997, Brook was 21 and was considered the oldest living female southern sea otter in an aquarium or zoo.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Brook']}}, {'sent': 'Sign up for our Coast Lines newsletter , a weekly digest of news and features on how the residents of the SoCal coast are building ties to their changing environment.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Coast Lines']}}, {'sent': 'Brook, as a 1-year-old pup, was one of the first sea critters brought to the aquarium in 1998, before the aquarium was open to the public.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'Long-time Aquarium volunteer and blogger Hugh Ryono recently posted a video of Brook and Charlie as pups frolicking in the Aquarium’s sea otter habitat in 1998.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Charlie', 'Hugh Ryono'], 'GPE': ['Brook', 'Aquarium']}}, {'sent': 'Biologists believe that at one time, between 16,000 and 20,000 sea otters could be found along the coast between Baja California and the Pacific Northwest, according to the aquarium’s website.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['between 16,000 and 20,000', 'one'], 'GPE': ['Baja', 'California']}}, {'sent': 'The fur trade from the late 1700s to early 1900s nearly brought the animals to extinction, but a colony of about 50 otters was discovered in 1938 in a cove near the Bixby Bridge in Big Sur.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['about 50'], 'GPE': ['Big Sur']}}, {'sent': 'Then, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service implemented a program in 1987 that introduced a small species of otters to San Nicolas Island, which is part of California’s Channel Islands, in an effort to protect the federally threatened sea otter.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service'], 'GPE': ['Channel Islands', 'California']}}, {'sent': 'As part of that program, “no otter zones” were set up, which meant any otters found south of Santa Barbara County were relocated to the north.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Santa Barbara County']}}, {'sent': 'The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service terminated the program in December 2012, allowing the otters to swim in their natural range, which was expected to boost recovery of the species.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service']}}, {'sent': 'At that time, the population was estimated at 2,792, according to a 2012 U.S. Geological Survey.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['2,792'], 'ORG': ['U.S. Geological Survey']}}, {'sent': 'In 2014, that number rose to 2,944.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['2,944']}}, {'sent': 'A whale-watching boat from Dana Wharf saw an otter off the coast of Laguna in December 2011.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Dana Wharf', 'Laguna']}}];Positive

3. Doctor P – “Virtual Reality” (Feint Remix) (Rampage)

We’re a sucker for a good drum & bass remix of anything dubstep, so when we saw Feint was remixing Doctor P’s Rampage anthem “Virtual Reality” we were over the moon! Maintaining the whimsical, 8-bit flavor associated with Doctor P and iconic original melody, Feint infuses a whole new energy into the track and his own signature brand of emotive, empowering DnB for a super fun and original end result.

11. Bensley – “Secrets” (Flite Remix) (RAM)

One of my favorite albums of last year, Bensley’s Muskoka has been on repeat for quite some time, so we were excited to see this remix from US DnB pioneer Flite this month.

SIHANOUKVILLE (Khmer Times) – Thought to have been extinct until 2000 due to their unfortunate historical status on Khmer menus, the southern river terrapin – commonly called the “Royal Turtle” in Cambodia – is making a comeback on the Kingdom’s coast.

The terrapin, one of the world’s most critically endangered reptiles, was re-discovered by a group of researchers and conservationists from the US-based Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration (CFA) in 2001.

Research around the Sre Ambel River in Koh Kong province showed that the terrapins had been pushed to the brink of extinction, largely due to harvesting of their eggs and flesh for food.

Conservation efforts to save the creature were aided by a well-timed Royal intervention, with King Norodom Sihamoni personally ordering their protection via a Royal Decree in 2005.

This resulted in the strange-looking fresh-water animal becoming known as “the Royal Turtle” –Cambodia’s official national reptile and one of the Kingdom’s seven national symbols.

Efforts to bring it back from the brink subsequently intensified.

Recent Successes

In mid-July years of research and conservation efforts allowed for the successful release of 24 captive-raised southern river terrapins into a protected “soft-enclosure” where their progress could be monitored.

This month, the turtles left their enclosed area to be released into their intended home, the rivers and shores of Koh Kong where, it is hoped – with the ongoing monitoring and protection of locals and conservationists – they will begin to flourish.

Since 2000, a WCS breeding program has successfully been re-introducing the rare reptiles back into Koh Kong’s habitats, but recent weeks have marked the start of what the NGO is calling “an ambitious international collaboration to save the species from extinction.”

Poachers Become Protectors

In a stunning example of tackling a problem and moulding it into part of the solution, authorities first began making progress when they started paying locals, who were previously looting and selling eggs, to protect the nests instead.

WCS, in partnership with the CFA, initiated a community-based protection system around Sre Ambel, hiring former nest looters to search for and protect the nests, instead of harvesting the eggs.

Since then, 39 nests with a total of 564 eggs have been protected, resulting in 382 hatchlings, who would have otherwise probably been eaten.

Hatched in protected enclosures, the baby turtles are then transferred to a facility and raised for several years in captivity, enabling them to reach a size where they would be less vulnerable to predators upon release.

A Hopeful Future

“We are very hopeful for the future of Cambodia’s Royal Turtle,” said Heng Sovannara, deputy director of the conservation department at CFA.

“We find very few nests each year due to the rarity of the species, but we have been very successful with protecting wild nests and raising the hatchlings.”

Returning the now adult turtles back to the wild, however, marks a vital stage in restoring the population and bringing the endangered reptile back from the brink, Mr. Sovannara said.

WCS regional herpetologist, Steven Platt, said that it is an important year for Cambodian conservation.

“A series of releases over recent weeks have trebled the wild population of the species,” he said, adding that further similar actions will help restore the southern river terrapin to its previous, important place in the local ecosystem.

Project to Expand

Recent advances mean that the project will expand. Plans already underway to develop more conservation facilities in Koh Kong province

More endangered reptiles are also on the radar of WCS in Cambodia, such as the Siamese crocodile, which is classed as critically endangered, having lost 99 percent of its wild population.

The Siamese crocodile was also believed to have been fully extinct in the wild until – again in 2000 – National Geographic’s resident reptile specialist, Brady Barr, discovered and caught one in Cambodia.

WCS, with their partners, plan to develop new facilities in Koh Kong that will house a greater number of animals and encourage natural breeding, enabling their projects to supplement wild populations on a larger scale.

Hard work remains ahead however, and Brian D. Horne, the WCS turtle conservation specialist, is quick to remind those celebrating that turtles still remain one of the most threatened creatures globally.

“The conservation of Asia’s turtles is a top priority for WCS,” he said. “We have long partnered with the Cambodian Fisheries Administration here, but more partnerships will enable us to be more effective in our efforts to recover this iconic species to its full ecological role.”

In Sembilang National Park, on the island of Sumatra, fires raged into primary forest that provides vital habitat for critically endangered Sumatran tigers and elephants.

Satellite data and imagery indicate the fires may have had a big impact on tigers in the park. In total, around 30 percent of tiger habitat in Sembilang burned between August and September. The fires also encroached into the park’s elephant habitat.

Fires have also reportedly ravaged elephant habitat in Padang Sugihan Sebokor Wildlife Reserve, which lies southeast of Sembilang and serves as a corridor for wild elephants in South Sumatra. One report estimates that half of the reserve has suffered fire damage.

Researchers say slash-and-burn clearing techniques likely started most of fires in the area, which were then exacerbated by drier-than-usual conditions and underground peat stores left unprotected by policy rollbacks.s

Recent dry-season fires that raged across Indonesia in September and October have taken a toll on forests, even in protected areas. Fires were particularly destructive in southern Sumatra, burning around 8 percent of Sembilang National Park, according to satellite data and local observers.

The fires, along with illegal logging in the area and the conversion of secondary forest and shrub land to oil palm plantations, continue to threaten critically endangered wildlife such as the Sumatran elephant, a subspecies of the Asian elephant, and the Sumatran tiger. Endangered Malay tapir, as well as several common primate species, are also known to inhabit the park area.

Until recently no known elephant populations existed in Sembilang National Park, but a study published in May in the journal Biovalentia: Biological Research uncovered four individual elephants in the park over six days of observation early early 2019.

The study estimates that there are between six and 10 individual elephants in the park area, ranging from north of the Sembilang River to south of the Bungin River and inland toward the west where the park borders the PT Raja Palma oil palm plantation.

Donny Gunaryadi, secretary of the Indonesia Elephant Forum, told Mongabay that the government is currently in the process of finalizing a new 10-year action plan for Sumatran elephant protection that is expected to start next year.

The plan will likely concentrate on preserving populations in the provinces of Aceh at the northern tip of Sumatra, Riau in the island’s center, and Jambi, which lies south of Riau and north of the South Sumatra province that is home to Sembilang National Park.

“The population is decreasing,” said Gunaryadi, who has been advising on the draft of the policy, estimating that there are now 1,400 elephants in Sumatra, down from 2,400 a decade ago.

In the 1980s, when Indonesia launched its massive transmigration program to resettle people from more populous areas of Java to other islands in the archipelago such as Sumatra, there were estimated to be as many as 4,000 elephants still on the island. However, conflicts between humans and elephants over land increased with the influx of settlers, and elephants have been on the decline ever since.

“This is a very serious decrease within 10 years,” Gunaryadi said. “Some of the problems are from poaching, but also [the elephant] doesn’t have a secure habitat in many areas.”

Tiger, elephant habitat likely affected by recent fires

Just how Sembilang’s tiger populations fared during the fires is not exactly known just yet. The Zoological Society of London has staff that follow tiger populations in the region, but they were not prepared to accept an interview at this time.

“Though we work on the ground and were impacted by the forest fires like many others, [the staff there] haven’t conducted any specific analysis or monitoring on the forest fires in Berbak Sembilang,” Emma Ackerley, a press officer with ZSL, told Mongabay.

However, satellite data and imagery indicate the fires may have had a big impact on tigers in the park. In total, approximately 20,000 hectares (49,400 acres) — around 30 percent — of tiger habitat in Sembilang burned between August and September, according to data from the University of Maryland, NASA, and NGOs WWF and RESOLVE, and imagery from Planet Labs.

The Berbak Sembilang National Park Authority did not respond to several requests to comment on the situation.

Yoga Travolindra, one of the researchers for the study that identified elephants in the park from the conservation group Forum Konservasi Gajah, has been on the ground near the park in recent weeks. He told Mongabay that the fires were unlikely to have killed any elephants since they mostly occurred in mangrove areas, which is not the elephants’ primary habitat.

Travolindra said that while tigers did use the mangrove area there was no evidence of deaths in recent field observations of that animal either.

“The [primary] problem for the Sumatran elephant today is that their habitat and ecosystems are disturbed from the conversion of land from secondary forests and shrubs into oil palm plantations by several companies located around the national park,” Travolindra said.

“At the moment the problems in the national park are mainly area encroachment, illegal logging, and use of large trawlers in fishing,” he said.

However, satellite data show that while fires were concentrated in and around mangroves earlier in the year, later burns moved into inland forests — including an area that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations considers elephant habitat.

Drier than usual and getting drier still

Travolindra said the fires likely stemmed from fires set intentionally to open up land for farming. Propelled by a drier-than-usual dry season and underground peat reserves, these fires spread out of control, affecting areas much larger than was intended.

“In general this year had been much drier compared to the past few years,” Arief Wijaya from World Resources Institute Indonesia told Mongabay. “These areas in South Sumatra host a vast amount of peatlands and are very susceptible to fires, and both [Sembilang and Berbak National Park to the north] are quite dominated by peatlands.”

Indonesia has vast unground stores of peat, which have built up over hundreds to thousands of years as vegetation died. Normally waterlogged and restricted to swamps, countrywide efforts to drain swamps and make them suitable for farming and logging has dried out many of Indonesia’s peatlands. And when it’s dry, peat is extremely combustible — and peat fires are very hard to control. Indonesia’s 2015 fire crisis that contributed to the premature deaths of more than 100,000 people is largely blamed on wildfires on drained peatlands caused by slash-and-burn agriculture.

Bukti Bagja, a land-use accountability manager at World Resources Institute Indonesia, said there was a strong correlation between the recent fires and illegal deforestation activity in and near Sembilang National Park.

“The pattern for these fire cases in that area is that it usually happens one or two months before the peak rainy season comes,” Bagja said. “To me this shows that people are preparing the land for the rainy season [when it wouldn’t be possible to clear].”

Bagja said the government had been trying to restore those peatlands after the devastating 2015 fires that burned throughout Indonesia, but that restoration has proven difficult. Blocking of drainage canals that had been dug throughout the area had not restored water levels sufficiently due to the particularly intense dry season, and some peatlands had already been claimed and cleared by locals for agriculture and other uses, Bagja said.

“The main problem is that during the dry season, from what we understand, there is a continuous decrease in the water table,” Bagja said. “When the area faces a long dry season, then the water table decreases 1 or 2 cm per day, and with the current canal system, the question is how to keep the peat area and the cultivation area moist.”

Vital habitat corridors under threat

Fires have also reportedly ravaged elephant habitat in Padang Sugihan Sebokor Wildlife Reserve, which lies southeast of Sembilang and serves as a corridor for wild elephants in South Sumatra.

One report estimates that half of the reserve has suffered fire damage. Since elephants in South Sumatra have such wide ranges it can be difficult to determine exactly how populations were impacted by the most recent fires.

As with Sembilang, Padang Sugihan is experiencing issues related to peatland draining and forest encroachment by industry and communities. In the past it has been well protected for the most part, even with limited budgets for conservation, according to Michael Allen Brady, principal scientist at the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR).

This protection, however, has not helped prevent this year’s damaging fires.

“We’re able to confirm there has been a lot of burning in the [Padang Sugihan] reserve the past two months,” Brady said.

“One of the reasons it is burning frequently is that they dug canals through it, seven major canals, and hundreds of tertiary canals,” he said. “It was logged over in the 70s and converted to transmigration lands and then they decided not to develop it and turned it back to the forestry ministry. Unfortunately they drained it but they had not cleared the forest, so it was essentially a timebomb, a standing peat forest that had been drained.”

Once the area was designated a wildlife reserve, the military herded elephants into the area in the early 1980s and the government recognized the reserve as elephant habitat. Brady said that following this, the government designated an elephant management unit, built an office complex on the border of the park and encouraged public visitation, but the situation “has deteriorated” in recent years to the point where the unit is non-functioning.

“Unfortunately there’s been no systematic monitoring of the [elephant] population in the reserve, but clearly it has gone from a population of about 400 to around a dozen,” Brady said.

Yusuf Samsudin, an elephant specialist with CIFOR, agrees: “Local rangers say there are only 12 left now.”

Two potential steps forward, one definite step back

Regulations enacted after the 2015 fire crisis broadly protected carbon-rich peatlands in the hopes of stopping it from happening again. But these were revised in April this year, limiting protection to “peat domes,” or areas where peat layers protrude higher topographically than the edges of the surrounding peatland. Sources say peatland exploitation and fires intensified after the policy rollback.

According to Wijaya, longer-term land-use governance issues need to be addressed in areas affected by fires, including increasing clarity about access to protected lands, resolving issues involving overlapping claims, and strengthening spatial planning policies.

Bagja recommends educational outreach. He says local communities and law enforcement have been slow to adapt to changing conditions, and need to be more aware that the peatlands are much drier now than they were just two or three years ago.

“Our hope in Indonesia is to bring awareness and knowledge about avoiding fires, to bring it to every household all over the country,” Bagja said. “They should understand it and the cost of using fires is much higher than the intangible cost, the externalities are much higher. The fact is that there are still big gaps in that understanding and knowledge.

“They think they can control it but this statement is not valid because the situation has changed.”

Backbone is Steinberg’s one-of-a-kind drum re-synthesizer, introducing new ways to design intricate drum sounds for every style of music.

Steinberg has announced the immediate availability of Backbone, Steinberg’s latest virtual instrument with a well-defined emphasis on creating unique kicks, snares, cinematic impacts, hi-hats and other percussive sounds.

Backbone is a VST, AU and AAX compatible plug-in that offers exclusive tools to design drum sounds from the ground up. Users start off by layering up to eight samples and move on to modify individual tonal or noise elements or re-synthesize individual layers, only to leverage the other audio manipulation tools that are easily accessible through the clearly laid out user interface.

At the core of Backbone is the re-synthesis engine, where samples are transformed into a synthesized version within the spectral domain, allowing users to manipulate samples with the freedom of a synthesizer. And the additional customizable spectral filter provides maximum control for creating new sounds.

Audio decomposition is another extremely powerful tool featured in Backbone. It allows users to separate sounds into their tonal and noise elements and adjust each of these with re-synthesis and classic subtractive synthesis.

Senior Marketing Manager Florian Haack says: “Backbone lets you create and manipulate drum sounds in unprecedented ways. You can feed the Drum Re-synthesizer with your own recordings and combine them with any kind of drum sample. It is such a powerful tool for those who like to get creative and want to develop their own signature drum sound. Personally, I have never had so much fun in crafting sounds as with Backbone.”

Availability and pricing

Backbone is available from local resellers and through the Steinberg Online Shop. The suggested retail price for the download is US $149.99.

Key features

Intuitively design drums with up to eight layers

Re-synthesize one-shots and loops

Directly export audio for clip-based music production

Backbone supports VST 3, AU and AAX

Eastern Gorilla;Gorilla beringei;Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Uganda;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Primates;Hominidae;Gorilla;beringei;I;Democratic Republic of the Congo,Rwanda,Uganda;;"The largest great ape, Grauer’s gorilla (Gorilla beringei graueri) has nearly disappeared in the past two decades. Numbers have plummeted by 77 percent; perhaps 3,800 remain. This animal, dubbed “the forgotten gorilla” because it was so little studied and was absent from most zoos, is in serious danger of extinction.

Their slaughter was precipitated by the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s bloody civil war and by mining for coltan and tin ore, “conflict minerals” used in cell phones, laptops and other electronics. Gorillas are heavily poached by armed militias, miners, and less often, by refugees: the animals are being eaten nearly to extinction.

The gorillas could suffer greater harm from warlords and miners if President Trump signs a proposed presidential memorandum leaked to Reuters. It would allow US companies to buy conflict minerals freely without public disclosure, likely increasing mining in the Congo basin — and poaching.

Trump’s plan would nullify the current US Conflict Mineral Rule, passed with bipartisan support in 2010 and enacted as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Dodd Frank Act. Meanwhile, conservationists are hopeful that the Grauer’s gorilla can be saved — but only with a DRC and planet-wide response.

For weeks, the primatologists had followed a group of Grauer’s gorillas over rugged terrain — hacking through dense rainforest; following knife-edged ravines; and crossing a nearly impenetrable mountainous landscape in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).

Stuart Nixon, Chryso Kaghoma and their Congolese field team tracked Gorilla beringei graueri using GPS. They collected data on where the animals nested each night, what they ate, and other habits. But the researchers kept their distance, trailing a day behind the primate family, so as not to influence the group’s behavior or normalize them to people.

Or so the scientists thought. One day, while sitting quietly in the forest, Nixon heard the bushes move some 10 feet away. He looked up and into the blue-black face of a big silverback male. They made eye contact for a few very long seconds before the gorilla turned and ran off with the rest of his family back into the dense undergrowth.

It was a rare sighting of a great ape that was once dubbed “the forgotten gorilla” because it was so little studied and was absent from most of the world’s zoos.

In two decades — just one generation — numbers of Grauer’s gorillas have plummeted by 77 percent. Only about 3,800 remain in the wild, according to a major study published in 2016.

The reasons: civil war and mining for “conflict minerals” including tin ore and coltan, both used in cell phones, laptops and other consumer electronics. The gorillas are heavily poached by armed militias, miners, and to a lesser degree, refugees, and they are being eaten to near-extinction.

“Illegal hunting for bushmeat is the biggest threat,” says Liz Williamson, a researcher at Scotland’s University of Stirling and a member of the IUCN Primate Specialist Group.

Proposed Trump policy threatens great ape

Both Grauer’s gorillas and local communities could be placed in even greater danger from warlords, militias and miners if President Donald Trump signs a draft presidential memorandum leaked to Reuters in early February.

The new policy would allow US companies to buy conflict minerals freely — including gold, tin, tantalum, coltan and tungsten — without public disclosure. It would likely increase mining activities in the Congo basin, bringing in more workers that will hunt bushmeat to survive.

Trump’s memorandum would nullify the Conflict Mineral Rule for two years. The rule was passed with bipartisan support from Congress in 2010 as part of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Dodd Frank Act. At the time, it was opposed by business interests, while human rights groups and environmentalists supported it.

The regulation as it currently exists requires companies to disclose conflict minerals that come from the DRC or an adjoining country. When it was passed, then-SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro said, “In adopting this statute, Congress expressed its hope that the reporting requirements of the securities laws will help to curb the violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.”

The Trump memorandum’s reasoning for the proposed rule suspension is that it has led to “some job loss” in the past. The administration did not respond to requests for comment from Mongabay.

African nations, however, immediately expressed concern: “This might ultimately lead to a generalized proliferation of terrorist groups, trans-boundary money laundering and illicit financial flows in the region,” the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) told Reuters. The ICGLR includes 12 African member states.

Counting Grauer’s gorillas

In the 2016 survey — the largest ever conducted for Grauer’s gorillas — park staff, local people and scientists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Fauna & Flora International combed 7,450 square kilometers (nearly 3,000 square miles) to count the animals in the eastern part of the Congo, the only place they live. Researchers then used statistical analysis and computer modeling to estimate population size.

Their finding sparked international news coverage and a triage reaction from the conservation community.

Within months, Grauer’s status was changed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to the red-alert last stage before extinction in the wild: Critically Endangered.

Grauer’s joined three other gorilla subspecies on the IUCN list: the western lowland (G. g. gorilla) and Cross River gorillas (G. g. diehli), along with the other and far more famous eastern gorilla subspecies, the mountain gorilla (G. b. beringei), which attracts tourists from around the globe who come to see them in the Virunga Mountains.

All gorillas are now Critically Endangered.

“Most people have never heard of [Grauer’s gorillas], and [yet] they might be the first great ape to go extinct,” says Sonya Kahlenberg, who directs the Gorilla Rehabilitation and Conservation Education Center (GRACE), the world’s only sanctuary for orphaned Grauer’s gorillas.

Catastrophic decline

Back in 1994 when the Wildlife Conservation Society surveyed Grauer’s gorillas (in what was then Zaire), researchers estimated a population of 17,000.

But then in April of 1994, the Hutu ethnic majority in neighboring Rwanda launched a murderous campaign against the Tutsi minority, a genocide that pushed some two million refugees across the border into Zaire and Uganda. Many took refuge in national parks and forests, and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and other militias set up operations there. Many survived on bushmeat, sparking what has become an ongoing gorilla “ecocide.”

The DRC government distributed arms to local communities to fight back. Many people fled. Forests became a major casualty — illegally logged both for fuel and the timber market. Hunting was rampant because of a deadly combination of hungry people and readily-available guns. Rangers and other law enforcement were forced to abandon national parks and other protected lands. The forests turned into slaughter grounds.

The stocky Grauer’s gorilla became a popular target. They are easy to track, moving on the ground in groups, and the animals provides lots of meat per bullet: they’re the world’s largest primate, with an average male weighing in at about 400 pounds. The largest tower six-feet three inches and weigh 600 pounds.

Conflict minerals stir the pot

By the time the war was declared over in 2003, some 5.4 million people were dead. But conflict still reigns in the eastern DRC — the Grauer’s homeland — fueled by a quest for the region’s abundant minerals.

Although the country has the world’s second lowest GDP, it’s considered to be the richest in natural resources, with mineral deposits worth at least $24 trillion, according to the nonprofit World Without Genocide. That includes an estimated $28 billion worth of gold and a vast supply of columbite-tantalite, or coltan, coveted for its use in electronics.

Exploitation of these riches has attracted hoards of artisanal miners, unscrupulous corporations, the military and corrupt government officials. Insecurity has flourished. But the greatest threat comes from more than 70 heavily armed militias, says Damien Caillaud, who is research director for the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund’s Grauer’s gorilla program in DRC and a professor at the University of California, Davis.

Many of the militias control “conflict mineral” mines that have become the equivalent of fiefdoms, existing beyond government control, sometimes employing slave labor, and using profits to buy weapons and to support ongoing armed struggle.

Miners now operate deep within DRC national parks as well as in unprotected forests — the places where some gorilla groups managed to survive the civil war, and some of the last areas where Grauer’s gorillas live. The Belgium-based International Peace Information Service has documented more than 1,000 mines in the region, nearly all of them illegal.

The rogue miners present the greatest threat to Grauer’s ultimate survival.

It is illegal under national and international law to kill, capture or trade in either live gorillas or their parts and products. But armed groups and miners are hunting the apes at an astonishing rate, and at the same time, laying waste to the land, reducing lush rainforest to polluted, muddy moonscapes.

People, in close proximity to the great apes, also pose a pathogenic threat: gorillas are so closely related to homo sapiens that they are susceptible to human respiratory infections and other illnesses. The common cold can kill a gorilla.

Gorillas snared

A US-based organization, Gorilla Doctors provides care, when possible, for gorillas stuck in snares. One hopeful note amidst the carnage: more Congolese veterinary students are training in great ape medicine than ever, a discipline requiring a specialized skill set nearly as complex as caring for a human.

Killing one gorilla can have large collateral damage, ultimately causing the deaths of four or five others, says Caillaud, who explains why. Ninety percent of Grauer’s gorillas live in groups dominated by just one male, the silverback leader. Hunters generally target him, both because he’s the biggest, with the most meat, and because he’ll attack to protect his family. If he’s killed, the group disbands. No babies will be born until females find a new group to join. For those that already have a baby, it might not survive: a silverback may kill another male’s offspring, as lions do.

Rescuing orphans

There was no place to care for young Grauer’s gorilla orphans that were seized by wildlife authorities until 2010. That’s when the GRACE sanctuary was founded in the DRC with the goal of raising orphaned gorillas and teaching them the skills they need to survive in the forest as a new family. The first four gorillas were airlifted to GRACE on a helicopter operated by the United Nations peacekeeping force in the DRC.

Orphans require significant care and often suffer from a variety of psychological and physical trauma. In 2011, for example, a 17 month-old male was discovered in a village where he had been illegally offered for sale. He was too young to be weaned, but had been given no milk and was fed only cassava for months — which is not gorilla food. When “Lubutu” arrived at GRACE, he was severely malnourished, had lost much of his hair, and was weak and dehydrated. But he’s one of the lucky ones; he survived and is thriving.

Today, GRACE cares for 14 Grauer’s gorillas, ranging from a two year-old toddler to a 16 year-old adult. The apes live in forest habitat in a surrogate family group where the older gorillas take on mothering roles, carrying and protecting newcomers. Human contact is kept at a minimum.

“Gorillas are social animals and we see orphans turn around quickly once they are reconnected with gorillas. They need each other as much as they need emergency care,” says Kahlenberg.

One reason GRACE is so successful at saving orphans, she explains, is that the facility partners with some of the world’s best zoos, whose gorilla experts train and advise the all-Congolese sanctuary staff. Zoos are consulted via frequent Skype calls, and experts have made 63 separate trips to GRACE since 2010.

The region suffered some of the worst atrocities during the war, and almost everyone on the GRACE staff lost a family member during the conflict or after.

But the local community wants to move forward and is strongly committed to conservation. GRACE recently started a farm to grow food for the gorillas, says Kahlenberg, and every week about 40 kids show up after school to help weed and care for the crops. “I get so much hope from the people here!” she says.

With fewer gorillas now left in the wild, the sanctuary arrival rate is dropping. Last year, it received just one. The goal is to eventually reintroduce at least some gorillas to the wild, aiding isolated forest populations. GRACE has pinpointed one potential release site. But this is uncharted territory: nobody has ever sent captive Grauer’s gorillas back into the wild.

Wild gorillas do accept changes to their family groupings, reveals Kahlenberg, “but we don’t know how much is group-learned. We don’t know how the [sanctuary-raised animals] will react around a wild silverback. There are so many question marks.”

Protection and research: a risky business

Defending wildlife in the DRC is an extremely dangerous business. Access to these remote areas by law enforcement agencies, including national park service rangers or environment ministry personnel, is very difficult and risky. More than 200 park guards have been murdered over the last 20 years defending wildlife. The two most recent victims are Oscar Mianziro and Munganga Nzonga Jacques, who were ambushed in separate incidents by armed militias in Kahuzi-Biega National Park in 2016.

Many of those who have lost their lives fighting to conserve gorillas, elephants and other animals, had large families of their own, with eight, nine, ten kids, says Stuart Nixon (who works now as the Africa Field program coordinator for the Chester Zoo, UK). Those murders not only impact the families, but also the tight knit village communities where the men lived. “It’s quite humbling,” says Nixon. “You don’t often see that kind of dedication in the West, let alone in the developing world.”

Lawlessness and violence in the DRC has made it nearly impossible to study Grauer’s gorillas. As a result, much of what scientists “know” has been extrapolated from a half-century of research on mountain gorillas living in the nearby Virunga Mountains within the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda.

G. b. graueri was named for Rudolf Grauer, an Austrian zoologist who worked in Africa at the turn of the 20th century. He was the first to recognize this great ape as a distinct subspecies. While these animals resemble their mountain gorilla relatives, their limbs are longer, they have shorter hair, and they live at lower altitudes, from 1,900 feet to 9,500 feet above sea level.

This last distinction is important, notes Caillaud, because habitat significantly shapes behavior. That means that mountain gorilla research isn’t 100 percent relatable: the size and use of habitat, for example, can differ between lowland and upland gorilla subspecies. So does diet — researchers know that Grauer’s rely more heavily on fruits than their high-mountain dwelling cousins. These differences can sharply impact great ape social systems and habits.

Despite the constant risk of violence, researchers including Andy Plumptre (a biologist with WCS), Williamson, Nixon and others have continued working in the DRC rainforests for years.

Nixon contacted eminent field biologist George Schaller before a major trip to ask him about his research, field work that dated to 1959 — the first on-the-ground study of Grauer’s gorillas. Using the maps Schaller shared with him, Nixon located about 15 groups that were living in the exact same locations they’d been in more than a half-century before. “They were surrounded by thousands of square miles of forest, but they hadn’t expanded their range,” says Nixon. “We don’t know why.”

Nixon’s 2005 study produced some disturbing results: “We were starting to realize that there were big areas where [Grauer’s had been] in the 1960s — and they were gone,” he says. New sub-populations that his team discovered that year were hunted out by 2010. “We had a feeling that the decline was catastrophic. But you have to think about what’s left,” he says.

Those working to conserve Grauer’s gorillas — government officials, park guards, conservationists and local community members — came together in 2012 to draw up a Conservation Action Plan. It identified cooperative strategies to build sustainable community livelihoods, and defined roles and collaborations for constituents, including the underfunded Ministry of Environment and Congolese Wildlife Authority, tasked with protecting DRC wildlife.

The consortium realized the need to quantify the severity of the Grauer’s decline with a broad survey. From 2013 to 2015, huge teams, often numbering 10-15 people, roamed the rainforest on physically challenging expeditions. Many surviving gorilla groups live in nearly inaccessible places, some as much as 30 miles from the nearest village or drivable road. All gear and rations had to be carried in on people’s backs, and security was a constant concern.

That exhaustive survey confirmed the continued, drastic decline of Grauer’s gorilla and led directly to the IUCN’s reclassification of the subspecies as Critically Endangered.

Points of light

“It’s possible that this terrible period is slowly coming to an end,” says Liz Williamson with surprising optimism. “In some places [national] park guards have regained control.”

She points to one relative success in an area key to the gorillas’ survival: the highland sector of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, site of the first-ever gorilla tourism in the 1970s. Before the civil war, this area was home to about 270 Grauer’s, a population that was halved by the slaughter.

Areas of the park that are now relatively stable have been secured through dedicated, cooperative efforts between the Congolese government; the country’s parks authority (ICCN); Fauna & Flora International, WCS and other nonprofits; park guards (working beside the military); along with local communities. Kahuzi-Biega has seen some level of protection since 2003, says Nixon. Today the population of G. b. graueri in one part of the park is back up to about 200 individuals.

There is also hope for gorillas in remote regions such as Usala forest, at the heart of the eastern Congo’s 30,000 square kilometer (11,600 square mile) Maiko-Tayna region. Nixon’s team investigated anecdotal reports from Schaller and confirmed the Grauer’s presence in 2007. Since the area is very far from roads or settlements, there is a chance the great apes could survive here over the long term.

“Despite all the pressure, this proves that with focus and targeted resources, these successes are possible,” Nixon says.

The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund has run a field station in the isolated heart of Grauer’s territory since 2012, in unprotected forest that lies between reserves. The facility’s Congolese staff patrols and collects gorilla data, and works closely with eight families who own vast tracts of land. Together, they are conserving gorillas and other wildlife. The families are poor villagers, not rich property owners, but they have chosen to control and reduce human activities on their land. As a result, wildlife is slowly increasing. “In just a few years, protection has had a detectable impact,” reports Caillaud.

About 25 percent of Grauer’s gorilla habitat first mapped by George Schaller had been razed by 2008. But today, even though some populations are isolated, there is still plenty of rainforest left. Though conservationists note that with growing human population, that won’t be the case forever.

So efforts are underway to protect key forest areas, with 2016 bringing a big success on that front. A new multiple-use protected area was created that benefits both wildlife and people — the Itombwe Natural Reserve, which stretches from lowlands to mountains and is one of the most biodiverse in Africa.

Consumer choices can help save gorillas

Few people realize when they buy electronics that the supply chain for those items can stretch deep into African rainforests. Parts for these products may come from mines that are run by ruthless militias and can contain “blood coltan.”

The insatiable international hunger for Playstations, laptops and cell phones — if not adequately regulated — contributes to insecurity, threatens the safety of local people and is killing gorillas and other animals. If the Trump administration’s presidential memorandum again allows US companies to buy conflict minerals freely, without public disclosure, the gorillas — and many communities — will face even greater danger as mines expand.

“I’d hope this makes people think about the supply chain for this equipment,” says Williamson, commenting on the real cost of conflict minerals. It comes down to consumer choices: if people care about African communities and great apes, “they should pressure the manufacturers and find out if they’re getting materials from credible, legitimate sources, which is difficult in DRC.” Even when mining operations are legal, supply chains may rely on militia that act as middlemen, she warns.

Conservationists note that consumers can help by upgrading electronics less frequently.

The stakes are high: Few Grauer’s gorillas exist in captivity, Kahlenberg concludes. And if this great ape becomes extinct in the wild, it will be effectively lost forever.

According to Kendrapara forest department, such a mass sighting of hatchlings have never been seen in the past decade.

""A total 2,05,10,000 hatchlings have begun their new journey into the Bay of Bengal. It has been going on for the last five days. Such a big number of hatchlings emerging out of eggs was never seen in the past decade. The process will continue for the next two days,"" the official was quoted by Orissa Post. For the past several years, there were hardly any turtles because of crowds, ships, and constant human intervention. These turtles are rare and are known for coming to Indian shores and Odisha's coast for mass nesting, every nesting season. The Odisha Wildlife Organisation (OWO) said that almost 50 per cent of the world's population of Olive Ridley turtles come to Odisha's coast for nesting, but it is difficult to make the eggs hatch successfully as they are either eaten up by strays or destroyed by fishing boats. The Divisional Forest Officer of Bhadrak further shared a video to show how the turtles build their nests during the mass nesting.

Mystique, a 29-year-old humpback dolphin, has been presenting gifts to staff and volunteers at the Barnacles Cafe & Dolphin Feeding Centre in Queensland, Cooloola Coast.

Mystique has not been trained to search for the items at the bottom of the sea, ABC reported, but has been keen to keep human contact during lockdown as fewer people visit the shore.

“He gets under it [and] if he drops it too far out, or we say ‘come on, that’s not good enough’, then he gets underneath it and brings it to us,” said Lyn McPherson, a volunteer feeder at the cafe.

“We swear he has a collection waiting to bring to us.”

The mammal has been giving items to visitors including coral, shells, bottles and wood in return for tasty bits of fish.

“What we have to do is give him a fish in return. We haven’t trained him, but he has trained us to do this,” Ms McPherson explained.

Volunteers at the centre say Mystique swims with a pod of up seven dolphins, but he is the only one known to search for presents.

It is thought Mystique first appeared in the area with his mother in 1991.

Mystique is the alpha male of his pod and is also scarred from his many battles, including a battle with a bull shark in December 2007, according to the cafe.

He is easy to spot because he has a chunk missing from his dorsal fin from the 2007 attack, the cafe says.

Barnacles Cafe & Dolphin Feeding Centre says its aim is to provide all visitors with a unique and memorable dolphin experience as well as increase awareness of these beautiful mammals and the dangers they face.

“Key buildings which are within the World Heritage area are threatened … this is of great concern to us, especially as this is not a single incident,” Mechtild Rössler, director of the World Heritage Centre told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Venice suffered heavy damage when floodwaters reached one of the highest levels in more than 50 years this month.

The city’s historic Saint Mark’s Basilica will need millions of euros of restoration work after its delicate marble mosaics were exposed to destructive salt water, its curator said.

Such damage is expected to worsen in years to come as climate change drives rising seas and more frequent inundations of the city’s small islands, set within a saltwater lagoon, heritage experts say.

The World Heritage Committee, an independent body of 21 state representatives responsible for making decisions about heritage status, is reluctant to remove any site from the list, as inclusion is meant as a motive for conservation, Roni Amelan, a UNESCO spokesman said.

So far, just two sites have been removed from the World Heritage List, he said.

They include Oman’s Arabian Oryx sanctuary in 2007, due to a lack of protection, and, in 2009, the Dresden Elbe Valley in Germany when a bridge was constructed across the site.

In both cases the “outstanding universal value” of the sites had been compromised, Amelan said in an email.

With Venice facing more frequent flooding, a UNESCO advisory mission to the city has been planned for 2020, with the World Heritage Centre preparing to dispatch experts to work with the city to assess what needs to be done.

GROWING RISKS

The city is revered as an architectural masterpiece and has one of the highest concentrations of famed art and architecture in the world, according to the heritage center’s website.

Its 118 small islands and lagoon were designed a World Heritage Site in 1987.

While the Italian city regularly experiences flooding in autumn and winter, recent floods, which peaked at 6 feet (1.8 meters) above sea level, are a clear indication of worsening climate change, Rössler said.

Global warming causes rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events, from heavier rain and storms to stronger winds that can push water toward the lagoon, Rössler said.

“UNESCO and the national authorities and the city have to deal with that in the long term,” she said.

Venice has since 2003 worked on installing a system of flood protection gates called MOSE - the Experimental Electromechanical Module.

But the project, intended to keep high tides and other floodwaters out of the lagoon, has bogged down in a “myriad” of problems, Rössler said.

Critics say the project has been plagued by corruption, cost overruns and prolonged delays. Engineers now predict the sea defense system will be ready at the end of 2021, at a cost of 5.5 billion euros ($6.1 billion).

The project’s original estimated cost was 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion).

World Heritage Centre officials also are concerned that, once the MOSE barriers are complete, the system, designed decades ago, may be inadequate to keep out ever-higher sea levels, Rössler said.

“This is not a project for now and tomorrow. This is a long-term project, and such a project needs to take into account the most recent studies,” she noted.

Concerned about growing climate change risks, the heritage center adopted a climate policy in 2007 and conducted a risk assessment of its sites.

UNESCO is also carrying out education and public awareness initiatives around climate change risks, according to its website.

A 2018 study by the heritage center found that 37 of 49 World Heritage cultural sites on the Mediterranean are already at risk of flooding, and 42 face coastal erosion threats.

Rössler said her organization will make available to Venice cultural and natural heritage experts from their network, and could help with fundraising for restoration efforts, though Italy - home to 55 World Heritage sites - has plenty of expertise of its own, she said.

The worst recorded flooding to hit Venice came in 1966, when 6.4 feet (1.9 meters) swept into the city. After that, UNESCO launched an International Safeguarding Campaign and undertook work to restore and repair artworks and monuments.

Chinchilla;Chinchilla lanigera;Argentina, Chile;EN;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Rodentia;Chinchillidae;Chinchilla;lanigera;I;Chile;;"Picture a golden cherub driving a golden chariot pulled by a golden butterfly through a golden forest. Then picture this richly gilded scene framed against the backdrop of a 150-million-year-old slice of reddish-brown petrified wood.

This fantastical tableau, rendered within the confines of a 43 mm 18-karat red gold case with a black onyx subdial accented with 18-karat red gold appliques, is inspired by the 1774 sketch Le papillon conduit par l’amour (“Butterfly driven by love”). The drawing of Cupid driving a chariot was sketched by The Draughtsman, an automaton created by Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz, son of brand founder Pierre Jaquet-Droz.

In the latest version of this classic timepiece, the Loving Butterfly Automaton is juxtaposed with the kind of extraordinary material fans of the Swiss brand have come to expect: The dial is made of Chinchilla Red, a mineral found in the eastern part of Australia. The extremely dense material is thought to have formed when volcanic ash settled on fir trees that were then swept up by lava. Jaquet Droz artisans spend hours simply smoothing its surface.

The scene depicted on the multidimensional and multihued dial springs to life when the crown-push button is triggered, which you can see in the video above, and the chariot wheel and wings start to move. The time-telling owes its accuracy to Jaquet Droz 2653 AT1, a self-winding mechanical movement.

The version with the Chinchilla Red dial comes in just 28 pieces, each priced at $126,000. Jaquet Droz announced in March that in light of the fires that devastated Australia earlier this year, a portion of sales will be donated to associations dedicated to reforestation and the preservation of endemic species such as “Plant a Tree for Me” or “One Tree Planted.”

In the past, the Loving Butterfly Automaton has featured dials made of onyx, jade, serpentinite, jasper and meteorite. As of this spring, it also comes in an opal dial version, available in 18-karat red or white gold, price upon request.";Jacquet Droz’s Latest Limited-Edition Watch Features a Moving Butterfly and a Petrified Wood Dial;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiECIjTv253Fu4BcbulGRRcJcqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowjsv9CjCPqPUCMKr2yAY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://robbreportedit.files.wordpress.com/2020/04/j032533275_loving_butterfly_automaton_front.jpg?w=1000;2020-04-20;[{'sent': 'This fantastical tableau, rendered within the confines of a 43 mm 18-karat red gold case with a black onyx subdial accented with 18-karat red gold appliques, is inspired by the 1774 sketch Le papillon conduit par l’amour (“Butterfly driven by love”).', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['43 mm'], 'GPE': ['Le'], 'PERSON': ['Butterfly']}}, {'sent': 'The drawing of Cupid driving a chariot was sketched by The Draughtsman, an automaton created by Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz, son of brand founder Pierre Jaquet-Droz.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Henri-Louis Jaquet-Droz', 'Cupid'], 'PERSON': ['Pierre Jaquet-Droz', 'Draughtsman']}}, {'sent': 'have come to expect: The dial is made of Chinchilla Red, a mineral found in the eastern part of Australia.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Chinchilla Red'], 'GPE': ['Australia']}}, {'sent': 'Jaquet Droz artisans spend hours simply smoothing its surface.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jaquet Droz']}}, {'sent': 'The time-telling owes its accuracy to Jaquet Droz', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jaquet Droz']}}, {'sent': '2653 AT1, a self-winding mechanical movement.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['2653']}}, {'sent': 'The version with the Chinchilla Red dial comes in just 28 pieces, each priced at $126,000.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['just 28'], 'MONEY': ['126,000']}}, {'sent': 'Jaquet Droz announced in March that in light of the fires that devastated Australia earlier this year, a portion of sales will be donated to associations dedicated to reforestation and the preservation of endemic species such as “Plant a Tree for Me” or “One Tree Planted.”\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jaquet Droz'], 'GPE': ['Australia'], 'CARDINAL': ['One']}}, {'sent': 'In the past, the Loving Butterfly Automaton has featured dials made of onyx, jade, serpentinite, jasper and meteorite.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Loving Butterfly Automaton']}}];Positive

Red Siskin;Carduelis cucullata;Colombia, Guyana, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of);;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Passeriformes;Fringillidae;Carduelis;cucullata;I;Colombia,Guyana,Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of);Trinidad and Tobago;"The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is celebrating the upcoming Endangered Species Day (May 19) with a slew of new births of endangered and vulnerable species. The births have ranged from mammals to birds, and some of the new arrivals will be reintroduced to the wild later this year.

Two loggerhead shrike chicks hatched April 4. The chicks have fledged and are doing well. The species—also known as butcher birds for their behavior of impaling prey on thorns and barbed wire—was once common across North America. Their populations have fallen by 70 percent. SCBI scientists are working with wildlife biologists in Virginia and West Virginia investigating possible causes for the decline. In the past, chicks born at SCBI have been transferred to the Toronto Zoo in Canada to enter its reintroduction program for loggerhead shrikes. Scientists have not yet determined if the two chicks born this year are candidates for reintroduction.

For the first time ever, SCBI is home to a red siskin chick—one of the most endangered birds on the planet. The chick hatched between April 10 and 11. Two other chicks hatched around the same time but did not survive longer than a few days. The birds were the first to hatch since the species arrived at SCBI in 2015. SCBI and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, along with partners in Venezuela, are working to build a self-sustaining population of red siskin that can eventually be reintroduced to the wild. Red siskin are songbirds native to South America, named after their fiery-red plumage. They are endangered due to threats from the pet trade and habitat loss.

A white-naped crane chick hatched April 26 and is the 43rd to hatch at SCBI. This chick is the second for parents Brenda and Eddie. SCBI specializes in producing chicks from cranes that have behavioral or physical impediments that prevent them from breeding. The chick’s parents are one of the only white-naped crane pairs living at the research facility capable of breeding naturally. There are an estimated 5,000 white-naped cranes living in the wild, and the species is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

litter of seven black-footed ferret kits was born May 2 and is doing well. They were born blind and with thin white hair covering their bodies, but they will develop their dark facemask markings by the time they are three weeks old. Their eyes will open by the time they are 3 weeks old, and kits are usually living independently by the autumn. Black-footed ferrets born at SCBI are routinely reintroduced to the wild each year.

Two maned wolf pups were born May 4 to first-time parents Layla and Santiago. Parents and pups are doing well. Keepers and veterinarians will determine the pups’ sexes and give them a more thorough exam when they are 6 weeks old. Maned wolves are omnivorous canids that live in loosely monogamous pairs and are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. Their main threat is habitat loss.

A Przewalski’s horse foal arrived overnight May 9. The filly and her mother Maja are doing well and currently living separately from the rest of the herd of female Przewalski’s horses at SCBI. Forty foals have been born at SCBI since the species first came to the facility in 1983. SCBI scientists are monitoring Przewalski’s that have been reintroduced to the wild in China and Mongolia using satellite tracking collars. Przewalski’s are the last wild species of horse. The tan stocky horses were once extinct in the wild. All of the Przewalski’s horses alive today descend from 14 founders.

A scimitar-horned oryx calf was born overnight May 15. The calf and its mother appear to be doing well. Keepers and veterinarians will perform a neonatal exam on the calf in the coming days to determine the calf’s sex and ensure it is healthy. The calf will nurse from its mother for about six months. Scimitar-horned oryx were extinct in the wild until a reintroduction project led by the Enviroment Agency—Abu Dhabi and the government of Chad began last year. SCBI scientists are tracking the 37 animals that have been reintroduced to the grasslands of Chad with satellite collars. Before the satellite collars were fitted on the reintroduced oryx, they were tested on SCBI’s own herd. Two more groups of oryx are expected to be reintroduced to Chad this summer, bringing the number of animals living in the wild to nearly 100. Three calves have been born in the wild since reintroductions began.";Baby Boom at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWx6b28uc2kuZWR1L25ld3MvYmFieS1ib29tLXNtaXRoc29uaWFuLWNvbnNlcnZhdGlvbi1iaW9sb2d5LWluc3RpdHV0ZS0w0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://nationalzoo.si.edu/sites/default/files/styles/teaser-desktop/public/newsroom/phorse_0.jpg?itok=nPQ5-2xi;2017-05-17;[{'sent': 'The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) is celebrating the upcoming Endangered Species Day (May 19) with a slew of new births of endangered and vulnerable species.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute']}}, {'sent': 'Two loggerhead shrike chicks hatched April 4.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two']}}, {'sent': 'SCBI scientists are working with wildlife biologists in Virginia and West Virginia investigating possible causes for the decline.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Virginia', 'West Virginia']}}, {'sent': 'In the past, chicks born at SCBI have been transferred to the Toronto Zoo in Canada to enter its reintroduction program for loggerhead shrikes.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Toronto Zoo', 'SCBI'], 'GPE': ['Canada']}}, {'sent': 'Scientists have not yet determined if the two chicks born this year are candidates for reintroduction.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'For the first time ever, SCBI is home to a red siskin chick—one of the most endangered birds on the planet.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['siskin chick']}}, {'sent': 'Two other chicks hatched around the same time but did not survive longer than a few days.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two']}}, {'sent': 'SCBI and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, along with partners in Venezuela, are working to build a self-sustaining population of red siskin that can eventually be reintroduced to the wild.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['National Museum of Natural History', 'Smithsonian'], 'GPE': ['Venezuela']}}, {'sent': 'A white-naped crane chick hatched April 26 and is the 43rd to hatch at SCBI.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['crane chick'], 'ORG': ['SCBI']}}, {'sent': 'This chick is the second for parents Brenda and Eddie.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Brenda', 'Eddie']}}, {'sent': 'The chick’s parents are one of the only white-naped crane pairs living at the research facility capable of breeding naturally.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'There are an estimated 5,000 white-naped cranes living in the wild, and the species is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['an estimated 5,000'], 'ORG': ['the International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'IUCN']}}, {'sent': 'litter of seven black-footed ferret kits was born May 2 and is doing well.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['seven']}}, {'sent': 'Two maned wolf pups were born May 4 to first-time parents Layla and Santiago.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two'], 'GPE': ['Layla', 'Santiago']}}, {'sent': 'Maned wolves are omnivorous canids that live in loosely monogamous pairs and are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['IUCN']}}, {'sent': 'The filly and her mother Maja are doing well and currently living separately from the rest of the herd of female Przewalski', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Maja']}}, {'sent': '’s horses at SCBI.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['SCBI']}}, {'sent': 'Forty foals have been born at SCBI since the species first came to the facility in 1983.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Forty']}}, {'sent': 'SCBI scientists are monitoring Przewalski’s that have been reintroduced to the wild in China and Mongolia using satellite tracking collars.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China', 'Mongolia']}}, {'sent': 'All of the Przewalski’s horses alive today descend from 14 founders.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Przewalski'], 'CARDINAL': ['14']}}, {'sent': 'Scimitar-horned oryx were extinct in the wild until a reintroduction project led by the Enviroment Agency—Abu Dhabi and the government of Chad began last year.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Enviroment Agency', 'Abu Dhabi'], 'GPE': ['Chad']}}, {'sent': 'SCBI scientists are tracking the 37 animals that have been reintroduced to the grasslands of Chad with satellite collars.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['37'], 'GPE': ['Chad']}}, {'sent': 'Before the satellite collars were fitted on the reintroduced oryx, they were tested on SCBI’s own herd.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['SCBI']}}, {'sent': 'Two more groups of oryx are expected to be reintroduced to Chad this summer, bringing the number of animals living in the wild to nearly 100.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two', 'nearly 100'], 'GPE': ['Chad']}}, {'sent': 'Three calves have been born in the wild since reintroductions began.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Three']}}];Positive

A global crisis sparked by unregulated or illegal hunting and trapping means 301 different species – from monkeys to bats – are now in danger, a new study claims.

Experts at Oregon State University in the US, who conducted the research, have warned the decline is having a significant environmental impact and undermining the food security of millions of people in Asia, Africa and South America.

“Our goal is to raise awareness of this global crisis. Many of these animals are at the brink of extinction. The illegal smuggling in wildlife and wildlife products is run by dangerous international networks and ranks among trafficking in arms, human beings and drugs in terms of profits,” said study leader Professor William Ripple.

“Our analysis is conservative. These 301 species are the worst cases of declining mammal populations for which hunting and trapping are clearly identified as a major threat. If data for a species was missing or inconclusive, we didn't include it.”

The authors studied data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species, and found both small and large animals to be at risk.

Researchers concluded that bold changes and political will were needed to diminish the possibility of humans consuming many of the world’s wild mammals to the point of extinction.

Of the species affected, 126 were primates, more than any other group, according to a team of researchers writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

Animal rights activists said the study should serve as a wake-up call to protect endangered species from extinction.

“This research should be heart-stopping news for anyone who cares about wild animal welfare and the health of our planet. Urgent action needs to be taken by governments across the globe to protect these hundreds of threatened species from extinction,” Dr Neil D’Cruze, Head of Wildlife Research and Policy at World Animal Protection told The Independent.

The authors found that wild meat made up a crucial part of global diets, with an estimated 89,000 tonnes harvested annually in the Brazilian Amazon alone.

They also found overhunting to be mainly associated with poorer countries, where hunters might find it harder to feed their families.

The research also showed much of the wild animal meat was sold in street markets and destined to become urban restaurant delicacies.

In 2010, another study found that about five tonnes of bushmeat was smuggled weekly in tourist luggage through Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France.

Dr D’Cruze said: “There are also the too often forgotten welfare impacts and high levels of suffering that animals, like primates, endure when captured and slaughtered for bush meat or the illegal wildlife trade. We must prevent the extinction of these incredible species, but we must also eradicate the pain and suffering being inflicted on millions of animals as we speak.”

Large carnivores and herbivores over 10 kg comprised a small percentage of the animals listed but were hit more severely by overhunting, it was claimed.

Scientists also warned the loss of large mammals could result in population explosions of prey animals, greater risk of disease and economic impact on humans.

The study found that 57 large species of even-toed ungulates, including hippopotamus, wild yak, camel and marsh deer, were threatened by hunting.

Smaller mammals were said to play crucial roles in dispersing seeds, pollinating plants and controlling insects.

Wild ox, camels, pigs, fruit bats, rhinoceroses, tapirs, deer, tree kangaroos, armadillos, pangolins, rodents and big cats, were all said to be affected.";Hundreds of animal species ‘being consumed to extinction’;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L25hdHVyZS9odW5kcmVkcy1hbmltYWwtc3BlY2llcy1jb25zdW1lZC1leHRpbmN0aW9uLWE3MzY5NDIxLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC9uYXR1cmUvaHVuZHJlZHMtYW5pbWFsLXNwZWNpZXMtY29uc3VtZWQtZXh0aW5jdGlvbi1hNzM2OTQyMS5odG1sP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/06/06/15/chimpanzee1.jpg;2016-10-19;[{'sent': 'Humans are consuming hundreds of wild animals “to extinction” for meat, ornaments, medicines and pets, according to scientists.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['hundreds']}}, {'sent': 'A global crisis sparked by unregulated or illegal hunting and trapping means 301 different species – from monkeys to bats – are now in danger, a new study claims.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['301']}}, {'sent': 'Experts at Oregon State University in the US, who conducted the research, have warned the decline is having a significant environmental impact and undermining the food security of millions of people in Asia, Africa and South America.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Oregon State University'], 'GPE': ['US'], 'CARDINAL': ['millions']}}, {'sent': 'Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Independent Premium']}}, {'sent': 'The illegal smuggling in wildlife and wildlife products is run by dangerous international networks and ranks among trafficking in arms, human beings and drugs in terms of profits,” said study leader Professor William Ripple.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['William Ripple']}}, {'sent': 'These 301 species are the worst cases of declining mammal populations for which hunting and trapping are clearly identified as a major threat.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['301']}}, {'sent': 'The authors studied data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN)', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the International Union for the Conservation of Nature', 'IUCN']}}, {'sent': 'Of the species affected, 126 were primates, more than any other group, according to a team of researchers writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['126'], 'ORG': ['Royal Society'], 'PERSON': ['Open Science']}}, {'sent': 'Urgent action needs to be taken by governments across the globe to protect these hundreds of threatened species from extinction,” Dr Neil D’Cruze, Head of Wildlife Research and Policy at World Animal Protection told The Independent.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['hundreds'], 'ORG': ['Neil D’Cruze', 'World Animal Protection', 'Wildlife Research']}}, {'sent': 'The authors found that wild meat made up a crucial part of global diets, with an estimated 89,000 tonnes harvested annually in the Brazilian Amazon alone.\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['an estimated 89,000 tonnes'], 'ORG': ['Amazon']}}, {'sent': 'In 2010, another study found that about five tonnes of bushmeat was smuggled weekly in tourist luggage through Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France.\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['about five tonnes'], 'PERSON': ['Charles de Gaulle'], 'GPE': ['Paris', 'France']}}, {'sent': 'Dr D’Cruze said: “There are also the too often forgotten welfare impacts and high levels of suffering that animals, like primates, endure when captured and slaughtered for bush meat or the illegal wildlife trade.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['D’Cruze'], 'PERSON': ['bush']}}, {'sent': 'We must prevent the extinction of these incredible species, but we must also eradicate the pain and suffering being inflicted on millions of animals as we speak.”\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['millions']}}, {'sent': 'Large carnivores and herbivores over 10 kg comprised a small percentage of the animals listed but were hit more severely by overhunting, it was claimed.\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['10 kg']}}, {'sent': 'The study found that 57 large species of even-toed ungulates, including hippopotamus, wild yak, camel and marsh deer, were threatened by hunting.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['57'], 'PERSON': ['hippopotamus', 'wild yak', 'marsh deer']}}];Negative
Vinaceous Amazon;Amazona vinacea;Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay;EN;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Psittaciformes;Psittacidae;Amazona;vinacea;I;Argentina,Brazil,Paraguay;;"A rare blue parrot that was among the last wild-born members of its species and was believed to have inspired the movie Rio has died outside São Paulo, Brazil.

The bird was a Spix's macaw named Presley, and he was around 40 years old when he died Wednesday. He was thought to be the second-to-last of the remaining wild-born parrots.

Presley's death is a blow to conservation efforts in both a symbolic and literal sense. Critically endangered, these native Brazilian birds (Cyanopsitta spixii) are believed to be extinct in the wild. Decades of deforestation and rampant wildlife trafficking have besieged the medium-size macaws, who also ended up having to compete for nest space with introduced Africanized honeybees.

Now, the fewer than 100 remaining Spix's macaws are cloistered in captive breeding programs and refuges throughout the world—and the small population is vulnerable to genetic defects caused by inbreeding. Presley offered the opportunity to inject some much-needed genetic diversity into the population.

But he left no offspring.

There are reports that Presley himself influenced the 2011 movie Rio, an animated film that tells the tale of a lone male Spix's macaw. Found living in the United States, the bird, named Blu, is initially unable to fly. But he returns to Brazil and finds the only other known surviving member of his species, a female named Jewel. Together, the two movie macaws battle wildlife traffickers and eventually start a small family.

Director Carlos Saldanha has said he hoped the movie would raise awareness of the challenges facing endangered birds in Brazil. ""I wanted [to feature] the rarest bird,"" he told the website Bird Channel in 2011. ""The Spix's macaw truly is the rarest.""

Released this year, an optimistic sequel, Rio 2, follows Blu and Jewel as they encounter a hidden population of Spix's macaws in the Brazilian Amazon.

Saldanha did not respond to requests for comment.

Presley’s story shares many similarities with Blu’s first chapter. More than a decade ago, Presley rose to fame when he was improbably found living in Colorado. Like so many of his kin, the bird had been smuggled out of his native Brazil in the 1970s, just as governments were beginning to regulate illegal wildlife trade. From his birthplace in the São Francisco Valley in northern Bahia, Presley traveled through several private bird collections in Europe before ending up in the American West.

During his years abroad, Presley's macaw kin vanished from Brazil's forests, with the last known wild Spix's disappearing in 2000.

In 2002, parrot enthusiast Mickey Santi answered the phone at the veterinarian's office where she worked. On the other end was a caller with a question about her captive Spix's macaw.

Skeptical of the caller's species identification, Santi went to visit the woman—and found Presley sitting in a small cage. He wasn't in great shape, and couldn’t fly. After six months of rehabilitation, Presley returned to Brazil via the San Diego Zoo, where geneticists collected a small sample of the bird's DNA.

Once in Brazil, Presley lived in the São Paulo zoo for several years. In 2006, he moved to the Lymington Foundation, a privately owned refuge and breeding facility for rare parrots in the forest outside São Paulo.

""He was very affectionate–just a very congenial bird, very chirpy, very talkative. He loved visitors,"" says Bill Wittkoff, Lymington's executive director. ""He's got an aviary that we'd wheel in and out, for the cold in wintertime and because of very, very hot sun. We'd go by his aviary often and he'd always gives us a chirp, a hello.""

Many parrots need the company of other birds to thrive. Bill Wittkoff and his wife Linda, Lymington's director, first tried to breed Presley with a female Spix's named Flor; the pair produced a bunch of eggs, but the eggs were all sterile. When Flor was transferred to a different breeding program, a new friend—Killer, a Golden Conure—kept Presley company. When Killer died, Presley's new partner was Priscilla, a Vinaceous Amazon parrot.

Presley ""was doing pretty well,"" says Linda Wittkoff. ""His death came as a surprise.""

Over the past year, health exams had revealed that Presley had an irregular heartbeat. When he suddenly lost his appetite late last week, the Wittkoffs took him to a university veterinary clinic in nearby Botucatu.

They'd hoped Presley would recover so he could move to a refuge closer to the clinic. The plan, they said, was for Presley to try artificially inseminating some of the female Spix's at the refuge, a procedure that hadn't been attempted yet.

Most captive Spix's macaws are closely related, and when such individuals breed, detrimental combinations of genes that would normally be eliminated are passed down. As a result, offspring are born with a host of problems, including increased disease susceptibility and infertility. Because he was unrelated to the females, Presley could have added some crucial genetic diversity into the mix.

But at 7 a.m. on Wednesday morning, Presley died, leaving the Wittkoffs without their cheerful survivor and the world without its best-known Spix's macaw. Linda Wittkoff says the veterinary clinic is working hard to preserve his reproductive tissues and genetic material, and save some of what he might have passed down.";Parrot Who Was Among Last of Its

""52 endangered turtles were found trapped in a 20 ft-long poacher's net in Keetham Lake, located in Soor Sarovar Bird Sanctuary in Agra. 42 turtles were found dead and rest 10 were in grave condition when rescued,"" Wildlife SOS said.

It said a local man was passing by the lake when he noticed a net sprawled out on the banks and immediately alerted the Forest Department authorities, which in turn contacted Wildlife SOS.

The rescue team found that the turtles were trapped inside a net, out of which 42 were already dead. With the help of the forest department officials they managed to rescue the rest, it said.

The team identified four different species of turtles- the Spotted Black Turtle, Indian Soft shell Turtle, Indian Flap Shell Turtle and Indian Tent Turtle, all of which are protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection Act 1972.

The rescued turtles were kept under observation and later released back into Keetham Lake in the presence of the forest department officials, it said.

""Turtles are mainly poached for their meat and their shells are believed to have traditional healing and medicinal properties,"" said Baiju Raj Director, Conservation Projects, Wildlife SOS.

LEGO DC 76157 Wonder Woman vs Cheetah, the new set inspired by Wonder Woman 84, is available now at LEGO.com.

There was a bit of a farce over the reveal of this product, but now it is available for fans around the world to buy.

Here is the official product description:

Young super heroes can relive Wonder Woman 1984 movie action with the LEGO DC Wonder Woman vs Cheetah (76157) building kit. When Wonder Woman (Diana Prince) encounters her archenemy, Cheetah (Dr Barbara Minerva), at the transmitter tower, the scene is set for an epic battle!

This action-packed playset gives kids double the fun. Down below in the bunker, Max tries to enter the tower, while overhead the transmitter panels rotate. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman and Cheetah confront each other. With super-cool features and so many possibilities for play, young super heroes will experience endless imaginative fun.

What is most surprising about this set is that the box effort goes to no effort to reveal what the toy itself is, instead focusing on the Wonder Woman 84 logo and the two main minifigures included in the set. It is another example of the LEGO Group experimenting with packaging design.

Wonder Woman 84 will be released on August 14, 2020.

With their flabby frowns, gurning grins and bloated, gassy stomachs, they're hardly going to win a pin-up competition.

But these disgusting creatures have become the surprise stars of a glossy new book in a bid to save them from extinction.

Unlike their cute and fluffy cousins in the animal kingdom, the plight of these rancid animals is relatively unknown. The Ugly Animal Preservation Society was set up to champion the cause of endangered creatures with no friends.

It is backed by a number of celebrity scientists, presenters and comedians, and organises road shows and school visits. Particle physicist and broadcaster Professor Brian Cox said: 'I support the ugly animal campaign. There are too many people trying to save cute animals. They get all the press, and all the attention. Ugly animals are more deserving than cute animals.'

Simon Watt, the society's president, said: 'We've needed an ugly face for endangered animals for a long time and I've been amazed by the public's reaction. For too long the cute and fluffy animals have taken the limelight, but now the blobfish will be a voice for the mingers who always get forgotten.'

The purple pig nosed frog is fat, purple and lives underground - perhaps because it is so hideous. But despite it gelatinous lumpy appearance the purple frog is the sole survivor of a group of amphibians that evolved 130 million years ago. Their population is thought to be in decline, thanks to the destruction of the forests for the cultivation of coffee and other crops, and so the species has been classified as endangered

Pacific Lamprey (lampetra tridentata): Looking like a vacuum cleaner pipe with teeth, the Pacific lamprey is a member of an ancient family that has been unchanged for millennia, and belong to the superclass agnatha, meaning ‘before jaws’

The common name of the Titicaca water frog is the scrotum frog, thanks to its extremely saggy skin. But the folds of extra skin are what allows the water frog to survive high up in the Andes in Lake Titicaca. Unfortunatley, there is a belief that eating the aquatic scrotum frog can improve a man’s masculinity and so many are stolen from the lake to be made into frog 'frappés'. Various zoos around the world are trying to breed them in captivity but have so far had only limited success

The red-faced bald-headed Uakari has the unfortunate apperance of a spanked bottom. Perhaps it is red-faced with rage because of having its habitat destroyed by logging in the rainforests of Peru and Brazil. On top of this, they are hunted for their meat or to be used as bait to catch bigger animals

He may be as ugly as sin, but the Axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) doesn't seem too bothered by it. Roughly translating to 'water monster' the aquatic creature walks on legs and while it does develop lungs, it doesn’t really use them, preferring instead to draw oxygen from its ruff of gills or even from its skin. If its habitat dries up, it can metamorphose into a form that will wander off in search of a new home. Creepy

The Cuban solenondon is armed with nasty teeth and a potent venom cocktail in its saliva that it uses to disable its prey.There are very few mammals that are venomous. Most of their forest habitat has now been lost to development, and as slow, clumsy movers they are easy targets for dogs, cats and mongooses

The Saiga Antelope are being driven into extinction by their aggressive mating ritual which leaves the men so exhausted that they often drop dead after. The male population is further threatened by poaching for their horns. This means that the groups are mostly female and that there is now a shortage of males for breeding, causing a further decrease in their numbers

With a perfectly upside down mouth, the blobfish is perhaps the ugliest of them all. Deep sea trawling in its home territory off the coast of Australia and Tasmania has made it endangered - but fishermen catch it by mistake and throw it, dead, back into the ocean

The Sulawesi Babirusa is so ugly that the people of the island of Silawesi, Indonesia, who call it the 'pig deer' make demonic masks thatmimic its face. It has curious upper canines that curve round and grow into the back of its skull

The Chinese Giant Salamander resembles a shiny sack of warts. But Its delicious peppery flesh is considered a delicacy throughout Asia and attempts are being made to farm them. But beware their strange falls, which are said to sound like the voice of a child

The Olm could be mistaken for a sausage - and it can see just about as much as one too. The curious salamander is almost completely blind and doesnt even have eyelids. Its numbers are declining due to over-collection from the wild, and the pollution of the waters in which it lives

The flamboyant looking Tonkin snub-nosed monkey is one of the most endangered primates in the world and the largest primate species of Vietnam.It was presumed extinct for a long time before it was rediscovered in 1989, and has been classed as critically endangered since then

Believe it or not, the baby bumphead parrotfish is a beautiful creature. But like an ugly ducking in reverse, it grows into this toothsome wonder. They have been hunted relentlessly and this once abundant fish is now virtually extinct in Guam, the Marshall Islands, parts of Fiji andEast Africa

The giant gippsland worm is rumoured to be 1.5m long and as thick as a man’s arm, with skin the colour and texture of the intestines of a cow. The largest confirmed sightings have been just 30cm. The Gippsland giant earthworm of Australia was first discovered in the 1870s and thought to have been, perhaps, some strange kind of snake

The rather dramatic looking California Condor was on the brink of extinction by the 1980s. But thanks to a concerted conservation effort, the first wild condor chick for over two decades was born in 2002.The California condor is the largest bird in America, having a massive wingspan of nearly 3metres

The ghost bat has super-size and strangely shaped nose and ears. Looking like an extra from a horror film, the ghost bat is so named forthe spectrally pale colour of its long, soft fur andnaked, fleshy wings

The shoebill takes his ugliness very seriously indeed. His huge, bulbous bill is straw-coloured with erratic, scratchy, grey markings. Measuring up to 24cm ithis bill is also ferocious. The small population is declining due to habitat destruction and degradation, nest disturbance, increased hunting levels and capture for the bird trade

Bizarrely, the Dugong is thought to be the inspiration behind the mythical creature, the mermaid. Supposedly, lonely sailors would spot them and mistake them for the sirens of Greek legend. The species has been hunted throughout much of its range andthough commercial hunting is now banned, many die by becoming accidentally caughtand drowned in fishing nets

The aptly named hagfish have teeth that lie in two vicious rows, and no jaws. To escape predators, hagfish secrete a sticky goo that will allow them a slippery exit. They have even evolved the ability to sneeze to free their own gills from the gloop

The big-headed turtle has a cranium so large inconvenience for the species, as it is so large it is unable to retract it into its shell for protection. Though it is widespread, being found in Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam and Thailand, the species is endangered - mainly due to popular demand for it as a pet or as a food

Proboscis monkey has the largest nose of any primate, drooping over the mouth and capable of growing to be up to a quarter of the body’s length. The numbers of this king of the mingers have crashed dramatically over the last forty years, thanks to the destruction of its habitat and a taste for monkey meat";Meet the world's ugliest endangered animals;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTI4NzczODgvV2UtdC1wYW5kYXMtTWVldC13b3JsZC1zLXVnbGllc3QtZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1hbmltYWxzLWNhbXBhaWduLXNhdmUtZXh0aW5jdGlvbi5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMjg3NzM4OC9hbXAvV2UtdC1wYW5kYXMtTWVldC13b3JsZC1zLXVnbGllc3QtZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1hbmltYWxzLWNhbXBhaWduLXNhdmUtZXh0aW5jdGlvbi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/12/18/2425D46800000578-0-image-a-58_1418926091300.jpg;2015-01-04;"[{'sent': 'The Ugly Animal Preservation Society was set up to champion the cause of endangered creatures with no friends.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Ugly Animal Preservation Society']}}, {'sent': ""Professor Brian Cox said: 'I support the ugly animal campaign."", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Brian Cox']}}, {'sent': ""Simon Watt, the society's president, said: 'We've needed an ugly face for endangered animals for a long time and I've been amazed by the public's reaction."", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Simon Watt']}}, {'sent': ""The Ugly Animals: We Can't All be Pandas by Simon Watt £9.99, published by The History Press.\n\n"", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Simon Watt'], 'MONEY': ['9.99'], 'ORG': ['The History Press']}}, {'sent': 'Their population is thought to be in decline, thanks to the destruction of the forests for the cultivation of coffee and other crops, and so the species has been classified as endangered\n\nPacific Lamprey (lampetra tridentata): Looking like a vacuum cleaner pipe with teeth', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Pacific Lamprey']}}, {'sent': ', the Pacific lamprey is a member of an ancient family that has been unchanged for millennia, and belong to the superclass agnatha, meaning ‘before jaws’\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Pacific lamprey']}}, {'sent': 'The red-faced bald-headed Uakari has the unfortunate apperance of a spanked bottom.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Uakari']}}, {'sent': 'Perhaps it is red-faced with rage because of having its habitat destroyed by logging in the rainforests of Peru and Brazil.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Brazil', 'Peru']}}, {'sent': 'Creepy\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Creepy']}}, {'sent': 'Deep sea trawling in its home territory off the coast of Australia and Tasmania has made it endangered -

 Great Hornbill;Buceros bicornis;Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam;VU;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Coraciiformes;Bucerotidae;Buceros;bicornis;I;Bangladesh,Bhutan,Cambodia,China,India,Indonesia,Lao People's Democratic Republic,Malaysia,Myanmar,Nepal,Singapore,Thailand,Viet Nam;;"A wildlife-based documentary series usually involves a typical format — stunning, but cliched, videos highlighting the natural beauty of the earth and an impassioned plea to stop their destruction before its too late.

This is where ‘Our Planet’ is different. The eight-part original documentary series lands you a blow in the stomach with its visuals of walruses flinging themselves to death off steep cliffs due to lack of space and an orangutan trying to stop a bulldozer from razing its home, along with other visuals of the mass murder of our flora and fauna that we humans have been perpetrating for years now.

However, the series from Netflix—created in collaboration with Silverback Productions and WWF and voiced by Sir David Attenborough — also features success stories from the natural world and uses the combination of grisly and jaw-dropping images of incredible species, shot on 4K digital videos, to drive home a message of individual culpability and personal responsibility. The project was filmed in 50 countries all over the world, taking in every continent, and took almost four years to make.

Bengaluru-based National Geographic explorer, wildlife filmmaker and conservation photographer Sandesh Kadur was part of the team that worked on the mega project. He helped in filming two big sequences in Kaziranga and Annamalai Tiger Reserve. Metrolife finds out more...

What was your role in the series ‘Our Planet’?

Broadly, we as a company, Felis, worked closely with the ‘Our Planet’ team to secure filming permissions and finding locations to film.

My job as a cameraman on the episode ‘Forests’ was to find a suitable story — something unique that no one has ever seen or been filmed before. We chose to film the Great Hornbill, this magnificent seed disperser from the Western Ghats. One of their little understood actions, a casque-butting fight in mid-air (birds striking each other in flight), is what we chose to show.

How did you decide what to shoot?

An avid photographer, Nachappa Aramanamada, brought these hornbills to my attention a few years ago. He showed me an image he had captured of the amazing casque-butting; I showed that image to Jeff Wilson, who is the series producer and a bird-lover. We then decided to go with this story.

What are the major challenges in doing a wildlife picture/video shoot?

The unpredictable weather proved to be our biggest challenge. Changing weather patterns make predicting the behaviour of animals very tricky.

We had almost given up on this sequence after waiting for a long time. Just as we were getting ready to wind up, the weather changed, the sun came up and the hornbills decided to perform in big numbers.

How is this series different from the many wildlife-based ones that have been aired before?

The message of conservation is built into the series; even if it’s not shown all the time, it is focused on and highlighted all the time.

There is apartnership with conservation NGO World Wildlife Fund, and the audience is directed to the www.ourplanet.com website to know how they can help. Thus everyone can do their bit.

A message for your viewers…

New species of purple crab: Insulamon palawanense. Photo by: Hendrik Freitag.

Scientists have discovered four new species of brilliantly-colored freshwater crabs on the Philippine island of Palawan. Described in the Raffles Bulletin of Zoology, the new species expands the genus, Insulamon, from one known crab species to five. Although its ecosystems are threatened by widespread mining and deforestation, the Philippines is a mega-diverse country, meaning that it belongs to a select group of 17 countries that contain the bulk of the world’s species.

Found in streams, the primarily nocturnal crabs feed on plants as well as small animals. The largest of the four new species is still quite small, its carapace spanning 5.3 centimeters, while the smallest carapace’s measures just 2.5 centimeters. The researchers theorize that the bright colors evolved for mating behavior.

The discovery of the new crab species follows two other recent biodiversity announcements in the Philippines. Two new frogs were discovered in Leyte Island in a biological survey last year. Meanwhile, the Dinagat bushy-tailed cloud rat (Crateromys australis) was rediscovered earlier this year after not being recorded for nearly forty years.

Palawan is home to a number of imperiled species only found in the Philippines, including the Palawan peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron napoleonis), listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List; the Philippine mouse-deer (Tragulus nigricans), Endangered; the Philippine pangolin (Manis culionensis), Near Threatened; the Palawan bearded pig (Sus ahoenobarbus), Vulnerable; and the Palawan Hornbill (Anthracoceros marchei), Vulnerable.

Palawan Island retains around half of its forest cover, but most of this in mountainous regions. The island’s lowland forests are imperiled by deforestation and mining, including widespread illegal mining. The Philippines remaining primary forests are largely found on Palawan.

Two new frogs discovered in Philippines spur calls for more conservation efforts

(04/19/2012) Two new frogs have been discovered on the Philippine island of Leyte during a biological survey last year by Fauna and Flora International, which also recorded a wealth of other species. Discovered in November on the island’s Nacolod mountain range, the frogs have yet to be named. The Philippines is one of the world’s global biodiversity hotspots, yet suffers from widespread deforestation and degradation.

Two-foot-long cloud rat rediscovered after missing for forty years in the Philippines

(04/17/2012) Czech computer programmer, Vaclav Rehak, was the first person to see a living Dinagat bushy-tailed cloud rat (Crateromys australis) in nearly forty years, reports GMA News. Rehak was traveling on Dinagat Island with his new wife, Milada Rehakova-Petru, a specialist on Philippine tarsiers, when he stumbled on the rodent, which has only been recorded once by scientists in 1975. Found only on the Dinagat Island, the rodent was feared extinct, but is now imperiled by mining concessions across its small habitat, which is thought to be less than 100 square kilometers.

The annual prize, which has been dubbed the Green Nobel Prize is awarded to six grassroots environmental heroes from around the world and includes a financial award of $150,000 for each winner.

Giant snakes commonly attacked modern hunter-gatherers in Philippines

(12/13/2011) Humans have an ambivalent relationship with snakes. The legless reptiles are often feared and reviled, becoming stand-ins for the Devil and movie monster characters; yet many people have grown to love snakes, raising large, even dangerous, specimens as pets. Now, new research suggests that the ecological role between snakes and humans, as well as other primates, is more nuanced than expected. After spending decades living among the Agta Negritos people in the Philippines, anthropologist Thomas Headland has found that the hunter gatherer tribes were quite commonly attacked by reticulated pythons (Python reticulatus), while the people themselves had no qualms with hunting, killing, and consuming python.

Tom Gullick achieved the remarkable feat when he managed to see Wallace's fruit dove, Ptilinopus wallacii, on a birding expedition to the remote Indonesian island of Yamdena.

This summer's sighting was the climax of a 40-year quest to see as many of the world's birds as possible, which began when the former naval officer left Britain in 1971 to become an expatriate birdwatching guide in Spain.

Mr Gullick is a ""lister"" rather than a ""twitcher"" (indeed, he is a ""big lister"") – one of a group of dedicated birders who compile ""life lists"" of all the species they have seen.

There are still 1,500 or so known species left for him to see, but speaking from his home near the town of Infantes in the Spanish province of Ciudad Real, Mr Gullick said he did not intend to try for the next big milestone of 10,000.

""Enough is enough,"" he said, laughing. But he said he was elated to have become the first person to break the 9,000-species barrier. ""I'd been trying hard to get there over the years.""

In the process of seeing more birds than any other person before him, Mr Gullick encountered many of the world's most legendary species – avian prizes which most keen birders can only dream about.

Near his Spanish home he can regularly see one of the most impressive and most endangered birds of prey, the Spanish imperial eagle, but he has seen everything from the bee hummingbird of Cuba – the smallest bird in the world, tinier than your thumb – to the blue bird-of-paradise of New Guinea, which is often said to be the most beautiful (it performs a spectacular courtship display).

He has seen the hyacinth macaw in Brazil (the biggest and most stunning flying parrot) and gurney's pitta in Thailand, which is not only one of the world's most brilliantly coloured birds, but also one of the rarest.

In fact, Mr Gullick knows all about rarities, as he was one of a small group of birders who in 1991 rediscovered a bird believed to be extinct – the São Tomé grosbeak, a red finch from the island nation of São Tomé and Príncipe, in the Gulf of Guinea off the African coast.

His achievement is the culmination of a lifelong obsession with all things avian, which began with the wartime evacuation of Mr Gullick's school to North Wales when he was eight. ""I began by collecting birds' eggs, like we all did,"" he said. ""I can remember climbing up an old apple tree to find a hawfinch's nest, and swinging on a rope to take an egg out of the nest of a raven.""

In being the first to break the 9,000 barrier Mr Gullick is elevated to a pinnacle of birding fame previously occupied by the ""big lister"" who first topped 8,000 – Phoebe Snetsinger, a middle-aged American woman who took up serious birding when diagnosed with fatal cancer. Her cancer went into remission, but her birding enthusiasm remained and by the time she was killed in a car crash on a birding expedition to Madagascar in 1999, her total stood at a then-record 8,400.

Mr Gullick knew Ms Snetsinger well – he had guided her on bird tours of Spain and Morocco. ""She always said to me it was only a matter of time until her number was going to be passed,"" he said. ""So I said, 'Who d'you think it will be?' And she said she was sure it was going to be an Englishman.""

Out of this world: Tom Gullick's greatest spots

Tom Gullick has seen more birds than anyone else. Aged 81, his list of 9,047 species includes rarities such as the São Tomé grosbeak, which was thought to be extinct. Here we present a few examples of the veteran birder’s feathery sightings.

Bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae)

The tiny bee hummingbird – the smallest bird in the world – flaps its wings 80 times a second and hovers over plants “like a helicopter.” It feed mostly on nectar and occasionally on insects.

Spanish imperial eagle (Aquila adalberti)

Until recently Aquila adalberti, also known as the Iberian Imperial Eagle or Adalbert's eagle, was found only in Spain, in the central plains and hills and on the mountainous slopes of the south-west, but three pairs have now recolonised a tip of eastern Portugal. Down to 30 pairs in the 1960s, human efforts to counter poisoning, electrocution and scarcity of food have raised the population of this large dark eagle to an estimated 300-400 individuals

Hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus)

Found in South America, the largest flying parrot feeds on nuts from palms and fruit; its strong beak is able to crack coconuts, brazil nut pods and macadamia nuts. It is endangered due to habitat loss and trapping for pets

Gurney’s pitta (Pitta gurneyi)

Another species named after a Briton (ornithologist John Henry Gurney), Gurney’s pitta was thought to have gone extinct in the 1950s , due to habitat loss, but small numbers were discovered in 1986, making it one of birders’ most sought-after sights. Living in the Malay peninsula, with small populations in Thailand and Burma, it eats slugs and worms.

Blue bird-of-paradise (Paradisaea rudolphi)

Native to New Guinea, this spectacular bird-of-paradise has an elaborate courtship display, performed solo, in which the male hangs upside down from a branch and fans out its violet-blue plumage. Hunting and deforestation have left it “vulnerable”.";World's greatest birdwatcher sets a new record – then hangs up

In sightings reported to the National University of Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI), at least 169 dolphins were spotted between 2008 and 2011 in the waters between Singapore and Batam. The mammals are most regularly spotted in the north-facing bay between St John's and Lazarus islands.

Here are some of the different species of dolphins and other marine mammals found in Singapore's waters:

- Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin, or pink dolphin

Species most commonly seen in Singapore's waters. They are born black, before turning pink as they grow up. Adults are white.

- Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin

Second most commonly seen species in Singapore's waters. They have a dark grey back with a lighter grey belly.

- Irrawaddy dolphin

- Finless porpoise

Hawaiian Monk Seal;Monachus schauinslandi;United States of America;;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Phocidae;Monachus;schauinslandi;I;United States of America;;"HONOLULU — A sick Hawaiian monk seal under the care of wildlife scientists is suffering from a parasitic infection often spread via feral cat feces, officials said.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration officials determined that the seal suffering from toxoplasmosis, the Honolulu Star-Advertiserreported Monday.

The female seal, known as Pohaku, was taken from Ko Olina on Oahu to the agency for monitoring after reports she was “logging,” or lethargically floating on the water.

There are an estimated 50,000 to 300,000 feral cats on Oahu and they are a primary source of toxoplasmosis, a parasite that reproduces in the digestive system of cats, the agency said on its website.

Hawaiian monk seals are exposed to the parasitic eggs spread by cat feces when they consume contaminated prey or water, the NOAA said.

Toxoplasmosis can destroy muscle, liver, heart, and brain tissue and cause organ failure. There is no vaccine and treatment options for infected seals are extremely limited.

Officials were “very guarded in our optimism” about Pohaku’s condition, the NOAA said.

“Despite aggressive treatment, she is very lethargic, a sign that the infection is causing pain and severe inflammation throughout her internal organs,” the agency said.

Eleven Hawaiian monk seals are known to have died from toxoplasmosis, although the number is likely higher because of unreported cases.

 Gharial;Gavialis gangeticus;Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Reptilia;Crocodylia;Gavialidae;Gavialis;gangeticus;I;Bangladesh,India,Nepal,Pakistan;Myanmar;"Into the wild: A young gharial in the Gandak. Into the wild: A young gharial in the Gandak.

On a sand strip amidst the river, resting calmly as only they can, a gharial came into view. “A huge one!” I exclaimed. “Not even fully grown,” the boatman chided me, as he cut the engine and deftly anchored along an island he knows like the back of his hand. Following a path used by nesting gharials, he showed me a couple of nests. Gharial hatchlings scrambled into the shallow waters. Only a small percentage, if any at all, would make it to maturity, but at least they were successfully hatching at one of the few gharial breeding habitats globally — the Girwa river in Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh.

Gharials (Gavialis gangeticus), freshwater fish-eating crocodiles endemic to the Indian subcontinent, can reach a stupendous length of 7m, with a long snout that ends ghara (pot)-like in the male, giving it its name. Cold-blooded, they can live up to 50-60 years. Unfortunately, they are critically endangered and number around just 750 – 1,000 adults globally, with 95 per cent in India and the rest in Nepal. In addition to the Girwa river, their confirmed breeding habitats till recently had been along the course of the Chambal, Narayani (Chitwan in Nepal) and Ramganga (Corbett) rivers. Other rivers like the Ghagra, Mahanadi, Son and Ken have either lost their gharials or have small non-breeding populations.

The gharial remains highly susceptible and people are wary of its size. In India, there is significant amount of human-crocodile conflict, and many mistake the gharial as the more dangerous mugger. In December 2007, over 110 carcasses of sub and young adults were reported in the Chambal river, which harbours about 80 per cent of the global gharial population. No conclusive cause was established, though poisoning was suspected.

The arrival of a few hatchlings on World Environment Day (June 5) this year along the river Gandak in Bihar, therefore, could only mean good news for the species and its conservationists — it confirmed a new breeding population for the gharial. “The Gandak’s force was such that we would hear its roar over and above all the sounds of this land,” said boatman Rajendra Sahni, while showing us Gangetic dolphins at the confluence of the Gandak and Ganga at Patna. Known as Narayani in Nepal, the Gandak enters India to get the protection of the Valmiki Tiger Reserve in Bihar for 45 km and the Sohagibarwa Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttar Pradesh for 7-8 km along its left and right bank respectively. Limited agriculture, few villages on its banks (as the river is prone to eroding its banks), no major towns, network of many small channels separated by vast mid-channel islands and low fishing pressure all provide a less-disturbed habitat for gharials here.

Dr BC Choudhury, senior advisor to Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), said, “Confirmation of a new breeding site is very significant.” In the late 1960s, a barrage across the river at Valmiki Nagar had destroyed gharial habitats downstream. The region had long suffered a law and order situation, which was somewhat brought under control around 2007-08. “During that period, gharials might have been killed, but there’s no data. Over time, the river geomorphology also got modified, probably favouring the gharials,” said Samir Sinha, head of the Gharial Conservation Project, WTI. During his time at the Valmiki Tiger Reserve, where he has worked since 2003, Sinha saw seven-eight gharials basking in the distance, along the Nepal side of the river. Enquiries in 2008 by gharial expert, late Dhruvjyoti Basu, bolstered Sinha’s sightings and triggered a survey in January 2010, which recorded a remnant population of gharials in the Gandak. An elaborate habitat assessment was undertaken in 2012 at the personal interest of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. Based on expert recommendations, release sites were determined along a 50-60 km stretch, and in 2014, restocking of gharials from the captive-born stock at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, Patna, was started by WTI as part of a Bihar forest department-funded project.

The released animals were tagged with VHF and satellite transmitters. Monitoring revealed that captive-bred gharials avoided the main current and stayed in groups as in captivity and dispersed after seven-eight days. Even after years of captivity, they were able to identify suitable natural habitat and used areas frequented by wild gharials. “It was heartwarming to see released and wild gharials basking together. After seven-eight months, one moved over 1,000 km to enter the Mahananda” said Sinha.

The two-year-old project has already paid rich dividends. A March 2015 survey showed that the Gandak harboured 54 gharials, including 26 adults. With the recent arrivals, the numbers are likely to rise.

Saving the gharial is no meagre challenge. Recent news that the Gandak will be developed as an inland waterway is a grave potential threat. There is no forest department equivalent for rivers and river governance structures are lacking. Along protected areas, WTI works with forest staff, trains them and suggests critical stretches to be monitored and actions to be enforced. Working with the Water Resources department, which operates the barrage across the Gandak, is important, as a minimum flow of water is required for gharials. In an email, Dr Jeffrey Lang of the Gharial Ecology Project, India, said, “The gharial in the Chambal, which hosts 80 per cent of the global population, is facing numerous threats, industrial scale mining is one of them.” Though sand mining is not yet a major problem along the Gandak river, the Mines and Geology department is another important stakeholder.

The other important stakeholder is the local community. “On the river, we discuss the threats with our boatmen, fishers and farmers and they give us important past information. You could say, they have become brand ambassadors for the gharials,” said Sinha. Gharial mothers compete for sand banks with other wildlife, livestock and the river. Nests are often dug up by jackals and cattle hoofs sinking into nests destroy eggs. Pegs around the nest blocked off cattle and a mesh embedded within the sand warded off jackals. These protection measures were removed when it was time for the hatchlings to emerge.

Mukundan Prasad, a farmer based near Ratwal ghat, said, “Last year, we saw gharial hatchlings downstream, but did not have any idea about nesting sites. This year, we worked with the gharial team and located the nests very close to our crop fields. Due to constant vigil, the nests were saved from erosion and depredation by jackals.”

A community managed in situ hatchery for gharials and turtles will help the villagers earn and establish bonds with the species. Choudhury, an old hand at crocodile work, said, “We plan to cover the entire Gandak, most of it outside protected areas. Involving Gandak communities in a sustained manner means a better future of the species. Only by working systematically and in a sustained manner with such multiple stakeholders can we secure the future of the gharial,” he said.

Conservation, however, is a long term commitment. Rigorous future-oriented planning processes need to ensure space for multiple stakeholders in the management regime and factor in the assumption that there will be some disturbance. WTI is committed to continue till the time that gharials are well established and the state functionaries capable of managing on their own. In a telephonic conversation, US Jha, chief wildlife warden, Bihar, mentioned, “A new project to strengthen gharial conservation, including setting up a gharial centre at Valmiki Nagar, is near finalisation. Bihar is committed to the long-term conservation of the gharial and is taking steps in that direction.”

The last two years have given Sinha and his team many priceless moments, among them, “a gharial nest at just 100 m from our tent; the first released animal entering the Gandak after nine years in captivity.” But the sight that he holds dearest is “a gharial hatchling emerging from its egg.”

The pink dolphins of Hong Kong are commonly known as the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins, or Chinese White Dolphins. These species are already vulnerable, and now at even higher risk due to reclamation projects in Hong Kong.

These pink dolphins (Sousa Chinensis) are similar to bottlenose dolphins in terms of size. They are born black, and they change color to grey and then white as they grow older. Frequently, these dolphins appear a bright shade of pink. This color is attributed to the blood vessels found close to the animal's skin to help it stay cool.

These dolphins keep warm in colder ocean waters. However, in warm tropical waters, they need to lose heat. Their cooling mechanism functions through passing the blood through their blood vessels, particularly during hot weather.

Currently, the Chinese white dolphin is listed as one of the species with unfavorable conservation status. During the late 90s, their population was only around 200, and currently, their numbers have plummeted even further.

As of 2019, Ocean Park, a marine park owned by the Hong Kong government has found a total of six dead pink dolphins, and two of the deaths were near the reclamation site of a third runway. This figure accounts for only thirty-two (32) individuals left.

Hong Kong's pink dolphins are not migratory and tend to stay within inshore waters, often limiting themselves to a meager area of 100 square kilometers. This habit makes them especially vulnerable to human activities that happen around Hong Kong waters.

As one of the busiest ports in the world, Hong Kong has a lot of sea and seaport-related activities that endanger the population of the pink dolphins. The shrinking number of dolphins along the Chinese coast is due to enormous reclamation and infrastructure projects around the dolphins' marine habitat. The surrounding waters become so bustling with human activities that it becomes polluted and dangerous.

Mr. Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, categorizes the threat into four: coastal development and reclamations, marine traffic, water pollution, and fishing.

Dolphin WL212 is an example of the tragic effect of marine traffic on the dolphins. In 2015, the dolphin was found with deep cuts that its tail was almost severed. It was presumed to have been hit by the blades of a boat turbine. The young male dolphin was only six years old.

Mr. Chang and his team observed the dolphin for three weeks. It was trying its best to survive and feed itself despite its injuries. After a media outcry, Ocean Park captured the dolphin for treatment. Unfortunately, the dolphin died from its injuries after four days in captivity.

The Airport Authority claims that with the third airport well on its way, it has been observing precautions to protect the dolphins. They keep speed limits for high-speed ferries, and they try to avoid percussive piling during construction. However, these are not the only battles the dolphins are facing. Contaminants in Hong Kong waters have also been found in high concentrations in the tissues of these pink dolphins and poses a considerable concern for their already-dwindling population.";Hong Kong's Rare Pink Dolphins at Higher Risk of Disappearing;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZXdvcmxkbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvNDM3MTUvMjAyMDA0MjQvaG9uZy1rb25ncy1yYXJlLXBpbmstZG9scGhpbnMtaGlnaGVyLXJpc2stZGlzYXBwZWFyaW5nLmh0bdIBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZXdvcmxkbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGVzLzQzNzE1LzIwMjAwNDI0L2hvbmcta29uZ3MtcmFyZS1waW5rLWRvbHBoaW5zLWhpZ2hlci1yaXNrLWRpc2FwcGVhcmluZy5odG0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://1471793142.rsc.cdn77.org/data/images/full/50392/hong-kong-s-rare-pink-dolphins-at-higher-risk-of-disappearing.jpg;2020-04-24;"[{'sent': 'The pink dolphins (Sousa chinensis) of Hong Kong are commonly known as the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins, or Chinese White Dolphins.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong'], 'ORG': ['White Dolphins', 'the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins']}}, {'sent': 'These species are already vulnerable, and now at even higher risk due to reclamation projects in Hong Kong.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong']}}, {'sent': 'Wikimedia Commons)\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Wikimedia Commons']}}, {'sent': 'The pink dolphins of Hong Kong are commonly known as the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins, or Chinese White Dolphins.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong'], 'ORG': ['White Dolphins', 'the Indo-Pacific Humpback Dolphins']}}, {'sent': 'These species are already vulnerable, and now at even higher risk due to reclamation projects in Hong Kong.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong']}}, {'sent': 'As of 2019, Ocean Park, a marine park owned by the Hong Kong government has found a total of six dead pink dolphins, and two of the deaths were near the reclamation site of a third runway.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong'], 'CARDINAL': ['six', 'two']}}, {'sent': ""Hong Kong's pink dolphins are not migratory and tend to stay within inshore waters, often limiting themselves to a meager area of 100 square kilometers."", 'ents': {'GPE': [""Hong Kong's""], 'QUANTITY': ['100 square kilometers']}}, {'sent': 'This habit makes them especially vulnerable to human activities that happen around Hong Kong waters.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong']}}, {'sent': 'As one of the busiest ports in the world, Hong Kong has a lot of sea and seaport-related activities that endanger the population of the pink dolphins.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one'], 'GPE': ['Hong Kong']}}, {'sent': 'Mr. Taison Chang, chairman of the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society, categorizes the threat into four: coastal development and reclamations, marine traffic, water pollution, and fishing.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Taison Chang'], 'ORG': ['the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society'], 'CARDINAL': ['four']}}, {'sent': 'Dolphin WL212 is an example of the tragic effect of marine traffic on the dolphins.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Dolphin WL212']}}, {'sent': 'Mr. Chang and his team observed the dolphin for three weeks.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Chang']}}, {'sent': 'Unfortunately, the dolphin died from its injuries after four days in captivity.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['dolphin']}}, {'sent': 'The Airport Authority claims that with the third airport well on its way, it has been observing precautions to protect the dolphins.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Airport Authority']}}, {'sent': 'Contaminants in Hong Kong waters have also been found in high concentrations in the tissues of these pink dolphins and poses a considerable concern for their already-dwindling population.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong']}}]";Negative

Her aptitude for social behaviour and learning made her a star around the world, raising awareness about gorilla conservation for the endangered species. The Gorilla Foundation announced her passing in California yesterday in a statement. The statement read: “Koko touched the lives of millions as an ambassador for all gorillas and an icon for interspecies communication and empathy.

“She was beloved and will be deeply missed.” How long do gorillas live in the wild? What is the average lifespan of a gorilla? The average lifespan of a gorilla in the wild is between 30 and 40 years, according to the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. But gorillas in captivity can live for far longer, as they are not at threat from predators and have plentiful access to food.

The World Animal Foundation estimates the average lifespan of a mountain gorilla to be 53 years in captivity. Why are gorillas endangered? Despite being revered for their intelligence, gorillas remain under constant threat from poachers and habitat destruction. The breed is divided into two species - the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla - both of which are critically endangered.

The World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) says less than 10 percent of gorilla habitats could be left undisturbed by 2030. What about other threats? Ebola, the viral epidemic which has killed more than 11,000 people to date in western Africa has also had catastrophic effects on gorillas. Around 90 percent of western lowland gorillas in the Congo and Cabon were “wiped out”, according to WWF.

 Vaquita;Phocoena sinus;Mexico;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Cetacea;Phocoenidae;Phocoena;sinus;I;Mexico;;"Marine scientists last month set out in the Gulf of California looking for vaquita porpoises, small marine mammals they feared might already be extinct.

Instead, they spotted a number of the animals, including mothers with calves, raising hopes that the critically endangered species can survive.

“We’re not sure when we go down there if we’re going to see vaquita again,” said Robert Pitman, a recently retired marine biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Each time, there are fewer and fewer of them. We were quite relieved to see them. We had several sightings over three days. The most we saw in one time was six separate animals, which gives us some slim amount of hope.”

Nonetheless, they said the trip also brought discouraging news, as observers saw scores of illegal fishing vessels in areas set aside for vaquita.

“At least one day we saw over 80 fishers there,” said Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, head of the Marine Mammal Research Group for the Mexican National Commission of Natural Protected Areas.

Vaquita are the world’s smallest cetacean and most endangered marine mammal, and live in shallow waters off the northern Gulf of California in Mexico. Grayish colored, with delicate features and dark marks around their eyes and mouth, they measure up to 5 feet long, and weigh about 110 pounds.

They’re resilient animals and versatile predators that eat two dozen different types of fish and squid, Rojas-Bracho said. Left alone, they’re well-adapted to the rich marine ecosystem they inhabit.

Their populations have plunged, however, as vaquita become entangled in gillnets set by fishermen in the upper Gulf. That has worsened as an illicit market has grown for another endangered species endemic to the region, the giant totoaba fish. Poachers catch those fish in order to export their lucrative swim bladders, and vaquita become trapped and drown in the totoaba nets.

Every loss of vaquita is a critical blow to the species’ recovery. Marine biologists estimate there are fewer than 20 of the porpoises left, and say they could even number in the single digits. Although Mexican environmental laws prohibit fishing in the federally protected Vaquita Refuge, researchers said they aren’t enforced.

“There are laws on the books, but there’s no serious protection,” Pitman said.

Beyond the lack of enforcement, Rojas-Bracho said, are active efforts to sabotage monitoring and recovery of the species. Although some Gulf fishermen interested in conservation and sustainable fisheries assist scientists in their efforts to protect vaquita, others have damaged or stolen the equipment they use to do so, he said.

“In recent times, because of the increase of illegal fishing, we are in a difficult crossroads,” he said. “There are illegal fishers sabotaging our monitoring program. What they do is they vandalize our monitoring equipment, and they steal our equipment, because we have lines and ropes, and they use that for fishing.”

Without acoustic monitoring gear, Rojas-Bracho said, researchers had to use visual observations to survey vaquita this year, and they were joyful to see a number of healthy animals. On one day, they saw six distinct animals in two groups, Rojas-Bracho said. Over the course of the trip, they spotted three mother and calf pairs.

“So the good news is they are producing calves,” he said. “And we have the survivors who have been able to survive all these years, and it’s important to protect them, because the survival of vaquita depends on these individuals we have now.”

In recent years, they learned other potentially good news about the species. Scientists had assumed that vaquita mothers only calved every other year, which would allow their population to expand at 4 percent a year, given proper protection.

In 2017 and 2018, however, they saw the same female with two separate calves, suggesting that vaquita may breed annually, potentially doubling that rate of growth, Rojas-Bracho said. Pitman cautioned that researchers aren’t certain that annual breeding is the norm, noting that the female who gave birth two years in a row may have lost a calf, and become pregnant again the next year.

If they can breed annually, however, that’s important, because captive breeding has been a nonstarter. A risky effort to breed vaquita in captivity failed, when a female animal died shortly after she was captured in 2017.

The key to vaquita recovery is clearing the waters of hazardous fishing gear, researchers said. They’re testing out different rigs that would not entangle the porpoises, but those haven’t been approved and made available yet, Rojas-Bracho said. Getting the right gear in place is essential to the survival of both fishermen and vaquita, he said.

“Conservation biology means having sustainable fisheries, and having vaquita survive,” Rojas-Bracho said. “It’s not one or the other. And if we have alternative gear, it’s just a matter of the political will to do it.”

Moreover, the researchers said, the problem can’t be addressed merely in terms of dollars and pesos. The disappearance of a species is an ecological and ethical casualty that transcends balance sheets, they said.

“We are working our way towards an impoverished planet,” Pitman said. “There’s money to be made chopping down all the forests, and killing off all the wildlife. And it’s extremely shortsighted, but that’s what we do as humans.”

Vaquita are collateral damage to the illicit fishing trade, but humans may eventually pay the price as well, Rojas-Bracho said.

“You cannot tell a species to justify their existence, in terms of human needs,” he said. “If you think only of the utility of species, then the world is going to look like the parking lot of any supermarket in the U.S.”";Scientists spot critically endangered vaquita porpoises with

 Star Tortoise;Geochelone elegans;India, Myanmar, Pakistan, Sri Lanka;VU;2020-06-18;Animalia;Reptilia;Testudines;Testudinidae;Geochelone;elegans;I;India,Pakistan,Sri Lanka;;"A star tortoise can fetch up to K500,000 on the illegal market. In 2001, star tortoises were recovered from a truck involved in the illegal wildlife trade at the border with China.





Under a conservation programme, the recovered tortoises were placed in Shwe Sat Taw, Min Zone Taung, and Lawkananda sanctuaries, and Yadanabon Zoological Garden in Mandalay. The tortoise population, which had been on the verge of extinction, has risen ever since.

“They had a narrow escape. As prices for star tortoises were high, many people, including children, tried to capture them. But, selling them is illegal. That’s why sellers get very low prices. Children dropped out of school to hunt for tortoises, causing lower education rates and social status in poor communities. According to the figures, up to 250 tonnes of tortoises were sent to China a year,” said Daw Kalyar Platt.

Tortoises seized at the border were sent to and taken care of at rescue camps; if they recovered, they were released in their natural habitat after examining carefully and marking them. As they have few natural predators, the tortoise survival rate is 97.5 percent, but they are at risk of extinction due to human beings. Their shells make good material for handicrafts, so various methods are being tried to conserve the tortoises, she said.





“We tell those who live near the sanctuaries that the tortoises have guardian Nat (spirits), so do not to hunt or kill them. We appoint some residents to take care of them. They know even if a stranger comes to the village. It is more effective if villagers control each other. But more than 100 tortoises have been stolen in the past five years,” said Daw Kalyar Platt.

Public knowledge is important for tortoise conservation. People make soup of parrot-beaked tortoises because they look like animals in mythology and people believe they have magical power. People also like tortoise-fighting because they fight until one dies. A thousand parrot-beaked tortoises crammed into small boxes were seized in Tachileik, near the Thai border, but many died, she said.

Tortoises rank No. 1 in the illegal wildlife trade. Myanmar star tortoises can be conserved although there are many obstacles. For now, they are safe from extinction, and the conservation work has good momentum, said Daw Lay Lay Khine, administrator of Min Zon Taung wildlife sanctuary.

“Min Zone Taung has more than 5500 acres of forest. We freed 1050 tortoises during 2013-2018. We are now studying to free them in Chat Thin sanctuary. There are 13 villages around Min Zone Taung. People in at least two villages rely on the forest for their livelihoods, including by stealing turtles, because they are poor and have to make a living. Other villagers return the turtles to the office,” said Daw Lay Lay Khine.

There are 10 sanctuaries and tortoise-protection camps, including Ban Bway village, about 20 miles from Pyin Oo Lwin. As state funding is limited for the camps, assistance provided by nongovernmental organisations is important. Medical examination of a single tortoise costs thousands of dollars; even one transmitter to track them costs US$200, she said.

There are 26 species of land and freshwater turtles in Myanmar, 12 of which face extinction. The Burmese roofed turtle is the second rarest type. Although they had been assumed to be extinct, five females and three males of the species were found about 20 miles from Hkamti along the Chindwin River in Sagaing Region, and preserving them has produced 250 more, including 150 at Yangon Zoological Garden, Daw Kalyar Platt said.

“We haven’t succeeded in changing people’s attitude.

A new study in Vietnam offers hope for a massive freshwater species.

(Inside Science) -- After nearly hunting a rare turtle to extinction, hunters are now working with scientists, pooling their collective knowledge to preserve the species.

The Swinhoe's softshell turtle (also known as the Yangtze giant softshell turtle) is the world’s rarest, with just one male in captivity and one other animal of unknown sex known to be living in the wild in Vietnam. Once found throughout the Red River and China’s Yangtze River floodplain, this large freshwater species has plummeted toward extinction in recent decades due to habitat loss, poaching and capture for illegal trade.

Following the death of the last known female in April, the future of this critically endangered species is grim. But carefully documented conversations about the turtles with veteran hunters offer new hope.

“The level of scientific knowledge is far from sufficient in Vietnam and probably explains why this species looks so rare,” said Luca Luiselli, a tropical ecologist with the Institute for Development Ecology Conservation & Cooperation, a nonprofit based in Rome, Italy. Luiselli co-authored the study detailing the hunters’ conclusions, published online last month in the journal Aquatic Conservation.

The research team interviewed 10 experienced hunters living in north-central Vietnam. In private interviews, the men described their recollections of the species and its decline. Nine noted that they believe the turtles remain living in the wild.

This kind of information, which researchers refer to as “local ecological knowledge,” provides needed information in “areas unknown to science, but very well known to local people,” said John Fa, a conservation ecologist from Manchester Metropolitan University in the U.K. who did not participate in this study.

The study's lead author, ecologist Thong Pham Van, conducted independent interviews of each hunter in native Vietnamese using a questionnaire developed by the Paris-based Turtle Sanctuary Conservation Center.

Based on the hunters’ responses, researchers learned that Swinhoe numbers began falling rapidly during the 1980s, an economically tumultuous time in Vietnam. Ongoing pressure caused a secondary drop in the early 1990s, after which there were few sightings.

Hunters estimated that they could recall size estimates for about one-third of the animals they caught over four decades. Males were larger than females, but the average weight across all individuals was still a hefty 120 pounds, supporting their status as one of the world’s largest freshwater turtles.

Most of the men said the turtles have an omnivorous diet -- a departure from the “almost entirely carnivorous” diets of closely related species, Luiselli said. Multiple men claimed to have seen the animals grazing on floating plants.

And importantly, all but one man believed turtles could still be found in Vietnam. Several alleged photos exist, although none are definitive proof. In 2018, a U.K.-based nonprofit claimed to have identified at least one turtle from the species using environmental DNA collected from Xuan Khanh Lake, but still the evidence is indirect.

A true rediscovery of a turtle species has precedent. Luiselli previously found the Nubian flapshell turtle, which was considered extinct, living in South Sudan by providing questionnaires to local fisherman. Based on their answers, Luiselli was able to capture several individuals “just where they said to look.”

“We’ve seen that even the most endangered species can be quite abundant,” Fa said. “Vietnam is a country we know very little about, but we’ve been finding more surprises.”

For example, the antelopelike saola, also called the “Asian Unicorn,” was photographed in Vietnam in 2013 for the first time since 1999. More recently, camera traps in lowland forests captured the first sighting of the silver-backed chevrotain -- a small, hoofed mammal known as a “mouse-deer” -- in 29 years.

The team will now need to follow up by looking for rare turtles in the wild. Among other ecologists, the reliability of questionnaire-based studies remains contentious.

Whit Gibbons, a herpetologist at the University of Georgia in Athens, said there are multiple ways the results can be misleading. “People can forget, they can lie or they can remember wrong,” he said.

But Luiselli believes such surveys can provide valuable information. When he conducted pilot studies in Nigeria that compared knowledge of snakes among locals to his own monitoring data, for example, he found that the results were consistent.

The group is currently interviewing fishermen so they can set traps in the most promising locations. Ideally, new turtles would help to reestablish the stalled captive breeding program and provide valuable information on an elusive species that is difficult to study.

Gibbons thinks they’ll succeed, but worries that any conservation efforts will be moot without addressing the multiple stressors turtles face: ""Someone is going to find them, but it might not make a difference [to their survival] without changes in cultural attitudes and habitat degradation.""";How Hunters Might Help Protect the World's Rarest Turtle;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmluc2lkZXNjaWVuY2Uub3JnL25ld3MvaG93LWh1bnRlcnMtbWlnaHQtaGVscC1wcm90ZWN0LXdvcmxkcy1yYXJlc3QtdHVydGxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.insidescience.org/sites/default/files/favicon_0.png;2019-12-18;"[{'sent': 'A new study in Vietnam offers hope for a massive freshwater species.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Vietnam']}}, {'sent': ""G.H.

These turtles landed on the endangered species list due to overharvest of their shells, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Hawaiian Hawksbill Conservation, the entity that runs the statewide photo-ID catalog of Hawaiian hawksbill turtles.

NOAA estimates there are only 20 to 25 females nesting annually on Hawaii.

Their population isn’t bouncing back as fast as the endangered green sea turtle’s. NOAA’s recovery plan for the U.S. Pacific populations of the hawksbill turtle says their approach to extinction is being driven by “intentional harvest of the species for meat, eggs and the tortoiseshell and stuffed curio trade (curiosity or souvenir trade).”

Increasing human populations and the concurrent destruction of the habitat are also of major concern for the Pacific hawksbill populations.

In December, marine photographer and videographer Terry Lilley received photos of a few new hatchlings. He wasn’t sure, but thought they were hawksbill babies.

“They do look like hawksbills, but I have never seen a baby hawksbill myself,” he said. “It would be pretty amazing if the sea turtles now come back to Kauai’s North Shore to lay eggs since the beaches are deserted.”

Lilley sent the pictures to Cheryl King at Hawaiian Hawksbill Conservation and to independent turtle scientist George Balazs. Both confirmed they were indeed hawksbills.

“It is very exciting that nesting has been found at Wainiha,” King said in her confirmation of the photos. “It’d be awesome for the community to start a monitoring program.”

Balazs said the major known nesting places for these turtles are on Hawaii Island, Maui and Molokai. A few nests are on Oahu. He also said their nests can be hard to find.

“It’s my suspicion that there’s more hawksbill nesting on Kauai than what we as humans know about,” Balazs said. “That’s because of the hawksbill’s low-impact, low-visibility nesting behavior when compared to green turtles. And, in a number of ways, that’s good.”

Balazs works on data-mapping for the NOAA Marine Turtle Research Program. The project catalogues and maps out nesting and basking trends of green sea turtles and hawksbills across the Hawaiian islands. They’ve only recorded one nesting area on Kauai, in Wailua.

This documentation adds a second hawksbill nesting site to that map.

Tom Woods of Reef Guardians Hawaii was encouraged when he saw the hatchling photos as well.

“Last time that I saw a hawksbill on the North Shore of Kauai was about five years ago at Anini,” he said.

 Malayan Tapir;Tapirus indicus;Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam;EN;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Perissodactyla;Tapiridae;Tapirus;indicus;I;Indonesia,Lao People's Democratic Republic,Malaysia,Myanmar,Thailand,Viet Nam;;"APPLE VALLEY, MN — The Minnesota Zoo has announced the birth of an endangered Malayan tapir calf. The yet-to-be-named female was born at approximately 5:45 a.m. on Saturday, Jan. 6 after about a 400 day gestation period; both the calf and mom ""Bertie"" are doing well. This is the Minnesota Zoo's third tapir birth in six years.

The new calf is the 37th tapir in North America. Born at 16 pounds, she is busy bonding with her mom.

According to the zoo, the Malayan tapir's gestation period varies from 390-419 days. Mothers usually give birth every 2-4 years to a single calf (twins are rare). At birth, a calf weighs approximately 10-20 pounds.

For the first eight months of their life, tapir calves resemble furry watermelons with legs. They are dark brown to black with alternating bands of yellowish-white stripes and spots. Young tapirs grow quickly and can weigh as much as 450 pounds at one year of age; they reach adult size in about two years.

""We are very excited to welcome this new tapir to the Minnesota Zoo,"" Tropics Trail curator Tom Ness said in a statement. ""Malayan tapirs are endangered and this birth is a significant conservation achievement, as it's estimated that fewer than 1,500 exist in the wild. The recent success we've had with tapir births over the past six years is an example of the incredible care our zookeeper and veterinary teams provides our animals.""

Malayan tapirs are one of the most endangered animals in Southeast Asia; there are less tapirs than tigers in the wild. Their population is declining due to habitat loss from deforestation for agricultural purposes, flooding caused by dam building for hydroelectric projects, and illegal trade, according to the zoo.

In human care, Malayan tapirs are managed for breeding purposes which, through the coordinated efforts of several zoos throughout North America, helps maintain a backup gene pool for the future aid of the wild population. The Minnesota Zoo currently participates in many SSP programs, including the Malayan tapir, according to a news release.

Until she goes into the public tapir habitat along the zoo's ""Tropics Trail,"" the Malayan tapir can be seen via the Minnesota Zoo's special webcam.

Two Asiatic black bear cubs have been rescued from the illegal wildlife trade in Vietnam.

Vietnamese authorities confiscated the two female bear cubs from wildlife smugglers in Hai Phong province on January 9, according to Vienna, Austria-based animal welfare NGO Four Paws. The rescue operation was a collaborative effort between Vietnamese police, Four Paws, local NGO ENV (Education for Nature-Vietnam), and Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand. The cubs’ origin has not been determined, and their mother has not been found.

After spending a night in a hotel, the cubs were taken to a Four Paws bear sanctuary in the city of Ninh Binh in northern Vietnam on January 10, where they are receiving intensive medical care. Four Paws’ Vietnam Animal Manager, Emily Lloyd, said in a statement that both bear cubs weighed just 900 grams and were dehydrated when they arrived, so the group’s team of veterinarians is providing the cubs with milk fortified with vitamins and probiotics.

“The bears are still very young, and the situation is critical, but we will do everything we can for their survival,” Lloyd said.

Authorities do not know who was meant to buy the bear cubs or where their ultimate destination was. It’s likely that the bears were imported from Laos, though they could also have come from a bear farm in Vietnam, Four Paws said.

Though bear bile extraction has been outlawed in Vietnam since 2005, it’s believed there are still as many as 1,000 bears being held in captivity on bile farms in the country. Four Paws said that research has shown that many bears are still used for bile extraction and that the illegal trade of bear bile is still ongoing in Vietnam.

Bear bile is used by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine to treat a range of ailments, from hangovers to liver conditions and cancer. A decline in the demand for farmed bile that began in 2010 has led to fears of a mass die-off of Vietnam’s captive bears as bile farmers are no longer able to afford to keep the animals.

The Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is listed as Vulnerable to extinction on the IUCN Red List. “Habitat loss due to logging, expansion of agriculture and plantations, roadway networks and dams, combined with hunting for skins, paws and especially gall bladders are the main threats to this species,” the IUCN reports.

A captive crocodile prior to its release

Conservationists have taken a massive stride toward saving the world's most endangered crocodile from extinction. In a major reintroduction last week, they released 50 captive-bred Philippine crocodiles into the wild. Prior to the release, hunting, habitat loss and overfishing had reduced the number of wild Philippine crocodiles to fewer than 100 mature animals. The newly-released crocodiles should be ready to breed in just a few years, the conservationists hope. Despite being a relatively small crocodile species that poses no threat to humans unless provoked, the Philippines crocodile has been pushed to the brink of extinction. After World War II, crocodile populations in the Philippines became severely depleted by commercial hunters taking the animals for leather. The big moment Across the densely populated country, marshes, swamps and creeks were converted to rice fields, removing the crocodile's natural habitat. Overfishing, fishing with dynamite and electricity and the use of pesticides all further reduced the reptile's numbers. Today, just 100 mature wild Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) survive, restricted to the northern Luzon and southwest Mindanao islands. Since 1987, Philippine crocodiles have been bred in captivity at the Palawan Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Center of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources on Palawan. Today, the Center is home to around 800 captive crocodiles. But there has been a problem reintroducing the crocodiles back into the wild. ""Philippine crocodiles in captivity are quite aggressive towards each other,"" says conservationist Jan van der Ploeg of Leiden University in The Netherlands and the Mabuwaya Foundation, a small non-profit organisation set up in Isabela Province to help save the crocodile. First taste of the wild ""But the problem with the captive breeding and reintroduction project was not so much the crocodiles but the people. A lot of attention went to the breeding, and too little efforts were made to address the threats, disseminate information and mobilise local support for crocodile conservation,"" he says. So van der Ploeg and colleague Merlijn van Weerd set up a community-based Philippine crocodile conservation project in the northern Sierra Madre on the island of Luzon. There they laid the groundwork for last week's reintroduction, gaining the support of the local government and people to release the captive-bred crocodiles. On 31 July, their project culminated in the release of 50 juvenile crocodiles, each about 1.2 long, into Dicatian Lake in the municipality of Divilacan. Ten have been fitted with radio transmitters. The most threatened croc of all

""Our team will closely monitor the released crocodiles in the coming months. We hope to collect information that can be used for future releases of Philippine crocodiles,"" says van der Ploeg. Dicatian Lake is situated in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park (NSMNP), the largest and biologically the most diverse protected area of the Philippines. The NSMNP now protects the largest single Philippine crocodile population in the wild. ""The release of 50 Philippine crocodiles in Dicatian Lake is a major step towards a recovery of the wild population and the future survival of this species,"" says van der Ploeg. ""In a few years the captive-bred crocodiles in Dicatian will be sexually mature. Then we will know whether the release has been a success."" ""The team is thrilled,"" he continues. ""This is the crown on our work. We have worked more than eight years in Sierra Madre, and this is a major milestone."" The Philippines armed forces provided transport for the crocs However, the reintroduction almost didn't happen. ""It was a complex operation,"" van der Ploeg explains. ""The crocodiles went by plane from Puerto Princesa to Manila. Then a 12 hour long bus ride to Cauayan in Isabela Province. The provincial governor granted us permission to use the helicopters of the armed forces to transport the 50 animals from Cauayan to Divilacan in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park."" ""We almost had to cancel the release because of the bad weather, but the pilots somehow managed to fly in.""

A leatherback sea turtle was found dead off the coast of Asilulu village in Central Maluku regency, Maluku, on Saturday morning.

Psst! AsiaOne is on Telegram! Tell your friends!

A leatherback sea turtle was found dead off the coast of Asilulu village in Central Maluku regency, Maluku, on Saturday morning.

Iwan Asikin, the head of the Maritime and Fisheries Ministry's maritime management division in Maluku, said the turtle was found dead by local fishermen.

""Fishermen Amin Mamang and Abu Nurlily found the 180-centimeter-long, 140-cm-wide turtle. But it had died before they found it. They then moved the carcass to shore,"" Iwan said on Saturday.

He said the turtle was likely swept away by strong currents and may have been killed after colliding with hard objects, such as coral heads.

""We are investigating the cause of death further,"" Iwan said, adding that Maluku Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA) personnel buried the turtle near the BKSDA residential complex in Passo village, Baguala district, Ambon.

Leatherback sea turtles, known locally as penyu belimbing, are the world's biggest turtles and the fourth-biggest reptiles after three species of crocodile.

In Indonesia, leatherback turtles are a protected marine species. They are considered endangered as their population has continued to decline over the years.

Last December, a 2.13-meter-long leatherback turtle weighing 213 kilograms was reportedly caught and killed by a resident of Sosorgadong district, Central Tanapuli regency, North Sumatra, as it was coming ashore to lay eggs. (rfa)

The flower produces nectar so that insects which drink it will be coated in its pollen and carry it to other flowers—both species perform a service for the other in exchange for something they value more.

However, one iconic symbiotic relationship—between the rhino and the oxpecker—may be providing rhinos with a lifesaving early warning system to alert them to the presence of nearby poachers.

Poaching is famously hard on rhinos, but the red-billed oxpecker, a bird which you may have seen riding on large mammals like buffalo and rhino while feeding on the parasites that cling to them, may actually be providing alarm calls to help rhinos escape such dangers.

Whether the oxpecker is alerting the rhino or other oxpeckers of the danger is unclear, but interpreting and relying on other animal signals is a behavior that’s well-documented in nature.

WATCH: ‘Fantastic Grandmas’ Have Been Spending Retirement Photographing Venomous Sea Snakes for Science

While the rhino has good senses of smell and hearing, they have poor eyesight, and if you stay downwind of the great beasts, you can actually get quite close without being detected—unless there is an oxpecker on its back.

The bird’s Swahili name Askari wa kifaru, which translates to the ‘rhino’s guard,’ gives us a clue to the timelessness of Plotz’s theory, which he proved correct in a research paper.

While writing his doctoral thesis on the black rhinoceros, Roan Plotz contemplated how the endangered species might avoid humans. According to a feature in National Geographic, Plotz noted that most rhinos he was observing didn’t have oxpeckers on their backs, which make hissing alarm calls whenever danger approaches.

Rhinos accompanied by oxpeckers successfully detected humans and demonstrated more physical signs of wariness at the approach of a human than those that were not accompanied by their feathered friends.

A mathematical analysis of all the research conducted showed a 40-50% reduction in sightings of rhinos when they were accompanied by oxpeckers.

Plotz suggests that reintroducing more oxpeckers into places with high-levels of poaching could potentially help reduce the number of rhinos poached. Another idea is to curb the use of pesticides, which are sometimes used directly on the fur of livestock to prevent the buildup of parasites. These chemicals have in some places extirpated the red billed-oxpecker who depend on the parasites of these livestock for food.

Rare and beautiful birds - including the national bird of Britain - are being illegally shot dead for fun or trapped before being plucked, skinned and eaten - or simply discarded. Across southern Europe and North Africa birds are dying at rates that are driving endangered species to the brink of extinction. From the lawless deserts of war-torn Syria to the cypress-lined fields of Italy, vast numbers are being killed. Many of the wretched victims are shot dead or trapped in nets en-route to Britain's back gardens.

NC A map showing the numbers of birds killed illegally each year across the region

For the first time, the appalling levels of bird slaughter have been laid bare by a detailed scientific review. The study – poignantly headlined The Killing – has been carried out by BirdLife International and and breaks down the killings, country-by-country across the region, pointing at the worst culprits and highlighting the species suffering the most.

CABS A robin killed by an illegal trap in Italy

Italy is one of the worst offenders on the great migration flyway between Africa and Eurasia. But worst of all is Egypt, where 5.7 million birds are illegally killed each year. It is followed by Syria and Lebanon with 3.9 million and 2.6 million birds killed, respectively.

Cyprus has a death toll of 2.3 million dead birds; Greece 704,000 France, Croatia and Libya, all around 500,000 each, and Albania 265,000. As well as our robin, bird species suffering the worst death tolls are chaffinches, blackcaps, quail, song thrushes, calandra larks and skylarks.

The illegal killing of tens of millions of birds around the Mediterranean is a source of lasting shame Tim Stowe, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds

Tim Stowe, international director at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, added: “The illegal killing of tens of millions of birds around the Mediterranean, highlighted in this report, is a source of lasting shame. “It’s time that action is taken to put an end to the killing, especially in the European Union where nature laws should be protecting vulnerable species. “If properly implemented and enforced, the EU Birds Directive would provide the necessary protection for a number of birds that feature in this report, and in time reduce the needless illegal killing. “We have seen positive steps taken this year to reduce the rate of illegal killing of birds, in places such as the Dhekelia British Sovereign Base Area, Cyprus. Now we need to put pressure on the rest of the EU to follow this example to ensure safer flyways for birds migrating between continents.”

The Committee Against Bird Slaughter (CABS) runs regular bird migration camps in Italy, France and Spain and on Cyprus and Malta, yielding tens of thousands of confiscated illegal traps and nets. Working with police units and wardens, it also catches hundreds of poachers red-handed every year. It warns that in EGYPT an estimated 5.7 million birds are killed illegally each year, making this country the most dangerous place for migratory birds in the Mediterranean. Indiscriminate hunting has become commonplace with a large number of migratory species caught as illegal incidental catches during legal trapping of quail. House sparrow, common coot, red-backed shrike and Eurasian golden oriole are illegally killed in large numbers.

Meanwhile, inan estimated 5.6 million birds are killed illegally each year.In the Brescia Alps, birds are trapped in tension snares, where many die of thirst or exhaustion. Migrant birds caught in nets are sometimes used to trap other birds: they are kept in the dark and released into daylight only in autumn. They mistake this for spring and then sing, attracting even more birds to the trap. Birds hunted in the Sulcis district are sold at high prices to restaurants and other private dealers to be consumed. Large numbers of chaffinch, meadow pipit and song thrush are killed in Italy. SYRIA is located on the second most important avian flyway in the world, which poses a serious issue given the lack of enforcement of hunting laws in the country, making it an ideal place for illegal hunters from around the region. Hunting has always been a traditional pastime; however, it has now become widespread and indiscriminate. In general, there has been a severe decline in the number of wild animals in Syria. A hunting ban exists in the country, but lack of enforcement has led to a new generation of amateur shooters who lack basic hunting skills and ethics and do not respect good hunting practice and etiquette. Rather than being a problem in specific areas, illegal killing of birds is a countrywide issue. Blackcap, common whitethroat and skylark are killed illegally in large numbers for food, which is sold in markets. Others are caught to be kept as cage pets and in many cases, killed for “sport”.

LEBANON: Located on the same important flyway as Syria, Lebanon is a strategic location for migratory birds. Unfortunately, widespread problems with the illegal killing of birds exist across the country. Normalised in society, illegal shooting and trapping has become an extremely popular pastime in Lebanon. As a result, the mean estimated number of illegally killed birds in Lebanon is more than 2,600,000 annually. CYPRUS: The Famagusta district of Cyprus is seen as the worst in the Mediterranean area for the mean estimated number of illegally killed birds each year. Geographically, Cyprus is a key stopover location for many migratory birds on their route across the sea. Unfortunately, birds tend to concentrate in particular parts of the island when leaving or arriving on migration, thus making things easier for those engaged in illegal killing. Laws forbidding trapping have been in place since 1974, but these are frequently flouted. Audio equipment is used, illegally, to broadcast birdsong and attract birds to trapping locations. Many birds are illegally sold as ‘delicacies’ for consumption – in particular, blackcap , song thrush, lesser whitethroat and common chiffchaff. The Akrotiri and Dhekelia areas are controlled as British military bases by the UK. BirdLife Cyprus finalised a National Strategic Action Plan to tackle the illegal killing of birds, which was also adopted by the British Sovereign Base Areas. GREECE: The mean estimated number of illegally killed birds each year in Greece exceeds 704,000. On average, more than five birds are reported to be illegally killed each year for every square kilometre. Presently, of the 345 species of birds assessed in Greece, 32 per cent of species are being killed illegally in significant numbers. Greece is among the three worst countries for the illegal killing of European turtle dove. Moreover, European goldfinch, European serin, European greenfinch and greater short-toed lark are caught in large numbers to be illegally sold as cagebirds. Greece is also among the top three countries that illegally kill Dalmatian pelican. FRANCE: In France, an estimated 149,000 to 895,000 birds are illegally killed each year. In the name of tradition, many regions get away with illegally trapping small birds with many non-target species getting caught in the process. Trapping is the predominant form of illegal killing of birds in France.";SKINNED and ready to EAT: British Robins among 25m birds SLAUGHTERED in southern

The limited edition Lacoste x Save Our Species polo shirts, which feature endangered animals such as the Sumatran Tiger and the Anegada Rock Iguana in place of the famous crocodile, were launched during the brand's runway show at Paris Fashion Week on 1 March 2018 and sold out immediately.

For each species, the number of polo shirts produced corresponds to the number of individuals known to remain in the wild. For instance, the most limited run features The Gulf of California porpoise, of which there are only 30 left in the wild, while the brand made 450 shirts featuring the Cyclone of Anegada Island – an iguana from the British Virgin Island.

The French brand made 1,775 polo shirts in total.

Proceeds from the sale of the shirts will be donated to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a 70-year-old international organisation working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources.

The Save Our Species collaboration, which was initiated by French advertising agency BETC, will help the charity to coordinate frontline projects worldwide in order to help ensure the long-term survival of threatened species, their habitats and the people who depend on them.

""The Lacoste crocodile is one of the world's most iconic logos, proudly displayed on the brand's famous polos for the past 85 years,"" said the Lacoste in a statement. ""For the first time in the brand's history BETC has initiated a change of the logo.""

""Lacoste and BETC worked closely with IUCN's experts to define and select ten threatened species, whose animals have been designed by the Lacoste studio to create the logos, adopting exactly the same embroidery approach as the historic Crocodile,"" it continued.

The Lacoste x Save Our Species polo shirts mark the beginning of a three-year partnership between the brand and the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The collaboration is not the first time Lacoste has altered its famous logo.

According to the Croatian Nature Protection Institute, there have been sightings recently off Cape Kamenjak in the north of country and along the coasts of nearby islands.

Members of the Mediterranean Monk Seal Group have taken over 4,500 photographs, and some video footage, of the new arrivals. The four or five individuals seen are not just casual visitors but have taken up residence.

Bigger than the common seal of Irish waters but smaller than our grey species, monk males are black with an off-white belly. Females are dark brown and whiter underneath. A solitary disposition and skin folds on the head, resembling a monk’s hood, led to the name.

Not much is known about this shy animal’s lifestyle. Males, thought to be promiscuous, are highly territorial at mating time. Females used to give birth on beaches but, with increased human presence, they now use caves with underwater entrances. The measure is only partially successful; pups are vulnerable to sudden tidal surges and freak storms. There is a glimmer of hope that with increased protection seals might be persuaded to return to secluded beaches. Mother seals were seen feeding pups in the open in 1945 and in 2008.

Irish grey seal mothers nurse their babies for a mere three weeks and then desert them, leaving their distraught youngsters to fend for themselves. Monk seal pups have a less Spartan childhood.

Although a mother spends most of the day at sea, she returns every few hours to feed her baby. Youngsters are weaned when four months old and reach maturity after four years. A seal can live to 45.

There are three species worldwide but one of them, the Caribbean monk seal, has not been seen since 1952. Killed for its oil, and its prey overexploited by fishermen, it was declared extinct in 2008. There are thought to be about 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals left. It too is critically endangered.

The Mediterranean species was once found from Gibraltar to the Black Sea and on the Atlantic coast of Africa. Vagrants turned up occasionally as far south as the Gambia and off the French coast in the north. Seals were hunted during the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages. Damage to nets, and thefts of fish caught in them, led to persecution by fishermen.

Pollution and heavy ship traffic rendered the species extinct in the Sea of Marmora and the Bosphorus. Monks have not been recorded in the Black Sea since the late 1990s.

Two main populations remain. There are thought to be about 400 monk seals in the Aegean and 130 at Cabo Blanco, a 60km long peninsula on the Saharan coast, the only location at which the seals still breed colonially. Two thirds of this population were wiped out by disease in 1997.

Monk seals haul out on the beaches of the Deserted Islands, 25km south east of Madeira. They are thought to derive from the African population. Only eight animals remained in 1998. On a trip to Madeira back then, I tried to visit the ‘Ilhas Desertas’, in the hope of seeing some of them, but could not do so without a special permit. Proper order! Protection has paid off; numbers have risen to 20.

Fragmentation in populations leads to inbreeding and reduced biodiversity. Contact between the Aegean and west African populations might increase the seal’s survival prospects. There have been reliable sightings of monks off Sardinia, the Balearics and Morocco in recent years.

Could the arrivals on the Croatian coast be a step towards recolonisation of the western Mediterranean? If so, they may in time make contact once again with their African cousins. Meanwhile, it’s up to us Europeans to protect this critically endangered species. We point the finger at countries elsewhere in the world when they fail to protect their wildlife. It’s time we practiced what we preach.";The return of the monk seal;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlyaXNoZXhhbWluZXIuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9vdXRkb29ycy9yaWNoYXJkLWNvbGxpbnMvdGhlLXJldHVybi1vZi10aGUtbW9uay1zZWFsLTI2NTk1MC5odG1s0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuaXJpc2hleGFtaW5lci5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlL291dGRvb3JzL3JpY2hhcmQtY29sbGlucy90aGUtcmV0dXJuLW9mLXRoZS1tb25rLXNlYWwtMjY1OTUwLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.irishexaminer.com/remote/media.central.ie/media/images/m/MonkSeal_large.jpg?width=648&s=ie-265950;2014-04-21;"[{'sent': 'ONE of world’s rarest mammals, the Mediterranean monk seal, has returned to the Adriatic coast.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['ONE']}}, {'sent': 'According to the Croatian Nature Protection Institute, there have been sightings recently off Cape Kamenjak in the north of country and along the coasts of nearby islands.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Croatian Nature Protection Institute'], 'PERSON': ['Cape Kamenjak']}}, {'sent': 'Members of the Mediterranean Monk Seal Group have taken over 4,500 photographs, and some video footage, of the new arrivals.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Mediterranean Monk Seal Group'], 'CARDINAL': ['over 4,500']}}, {'sent': 'The four or five individuals seen are not just casual visitors but have taken up residence.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['four or five']}}, {'sent': 'A seal can live to 45.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['45']}}, {'sent': 'There are three species worldwide but one of them, the Caribbean monk seal, has not been seen since 1952.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one', 'three']}}, {'sent': 'There are thought to be about 1,100 Hawaiian monk seals left.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['about 1,100']}}, {'sent': 'Vagrants turned up occasionally as far south as the Gambia and off the French coast in the north.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Gambia']}}, {'sent': 'Seals were hunted during the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['the Roman Empire']}}, {'sent': 'Two main populations remain.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two']}}, {'sent': 'There are thought to be about 400 monk seals in the Aegean and 130 at Cabo Blanco, a 60km long peninsula on the Saharan coast, the only location at which the seals still breed colonially.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['about 400', '130'], 'GPE': ['Cabo Blanco'], 'QUANTITY': ['60km']}}, {'sent': 'Two thirds of this population were wiped out by disease in 1997.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Two thirds']}}, {'sent': 'Monk seals haul out on the beaches of the Deserted Islands, 25km south east of Madeira.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['25km'], 'ORG': ['Madeira']}}, {'sent': 'Only eight animals remained in 1998.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Only eight']}}, {'sent': 'On a trip to Madeira back then, I tried to visit the ‘Ilhas Desertas’, in the hope of seeing some of them, but could not do so without a special permit.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the ‘Ilhas Desertas’']}}, {'sent': 'Protection has paid off; numbers have risen to 20.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['20']}}, {'sent': 'There have been reliable sightings of monks off Sardinia, the Balearics and Morocco in recent years.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sardinia', 'Morocco']}}]";Negative

The injured calf has two roughly parallel, S-shaped that experts say are consistent with propeller injures from a vessel strike sometime on Jan. 8.

“One of the injuries appears to include damage to the calf’s mouth which could hamper its ability to nurse and feed,” according to a narrative of the case from NOAA. “Biologists estimate the newborn is just days old and the wounds were perhaps hours old.”

The calf was spotted that same day by biologists with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, who work with NOAA in tracking the movements of highly endangered right whales on their calving grounds off the Southeast coast.

The calf was born to an approximately 27-year-old mother known to biologists as Derecha – Spanish for “right,” dubbed in keeping with biologists’ practice of identifying and closely tracking individual whales of maternal age. It was one of four calves born in this season, acclaimed by conservationists for adding to a population estimated at only 450 animals. Derecha herself last gave birth in 2010, according to NOAA.

Lobster and crab fishermen in the U.S. and Canada are under increasing pressure to come up with ways to reduce whale gear entanglements. But ship strikes are a mortal danger, and Canadian authorities have imposed additional restrictions on ships operations in the Gulf of St. Lawrence after whale deaths there.

In the following days biologists and veterinary experts assessed the calf’s injuries and saw them to be worse than originally thought, downgrading the calf’s condition from guarded to poor.

A bigger aid effort was mobilized including Florida and Georgia wildlife agencies, the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, Sea World, the Blue World Research Institute and International Fund for Animal Welfare, and calling on other experts to consult on the injuries.

On Jan. 15 a team again located the mother whale and calf off Ferdinandia Beach, Fla., and an aerial survey crew verified their identity and condition. A veterinarian determined the calf would benefit from antibiotics.

On one level this is surprising: a giant armadillo is about the size of a pig. But it’s also rare, solitary and nocturnal, spending up to three-quarters of its life underground. The giant armadillo is considered a ghost species – you know they’re there, even if you can’t find any.

Narrated by David Attenborough, Hotel Armadillo: Natural World (BBC2) was first and foremost a detective story, a lesson in the judicious laying of camera traps. Giant armadillos reside in deep burrows, and they dig a new one every two days. If you find that your armadillo is not at home, chances are he ain’t coming back.

In the armadillo’s absence, however, the vacant burrow serves as a hotel for other creatures: porcupines, peccaries, foxes, ocelots, tapirs and other, smaller armadillos who forage for roots and bugs in the newly turned earth. A sort of anteater called a tamandua uses the ex-burrow as a nursery. All in all, 80 species have been recorded either dropping by or moving to the Hotel Armadillo, making the giant armadillo a pivotal component of a fragile ecosystem. “The battle to save the giant armadillo is the battle to save biodiversity,” said Desbiez. “It’s all the same.”

The footage, when they got it, was amazing. You might imagine that an armadillo the size of a pig suffers from a deficit of the cuddliness so vital to preserving species, but that’s because you’ve never seen a baby giant armadillo (not many people have until now, to be fair), which is as cute as a dinosaur in a kid’s cartoon – an armour-plated kitten.

As is the form these days, one had to wait until the final “how we did it” segment to discover just how thankless a task filming giant armadillos is. The comings and goings of 80 species exponentially increases the odds of something kicking your equipment over in the dead of night. But if you like the idea of being dangled by your ankles into an armadillo burrow that may or may not contain rats, a career in wildlife filming could be for you.";Hotel Armadillo review – Attenborough checks in to an amazing animal AirBnB;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEDg-Nnw5-GPmyhZLBuuuo8qFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTCOvRU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64928ad75d47e169d1e33c3ff7bc18adfbafafe0/983_1240_2025_1215/master/2025.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=32c20c953d6ce1fcc6141d32b1484d43;2017-04-08;[{'sent': 'Conservationist Arnaud Desbiez worked in the Brazilian Pantanal for eight years before he set eyes on a giant armadillo.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Arnaud Desbiez'], 'ORG': ['the Brazilian Pantanal']}}, {'sent': 'On one level this is surprising: a giant armadillo is about the size of a pig.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'But it’s also rare, solitary and nocturnal, spending up to three-quarters of its life underground.', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['three-quarters']}}, {'sent': 'David Attenborough and BBC take us to Hotel Armadillo – in pictures Read more\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['David Attenborough'], 'ORG': ['BBC']}}, {'sent': 'Narrated by David Attenborough, Hotel Armadillo:', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['David Attenborough']}}, {'sent': 'Natural World (BBC2) was first and foremost a detective story, a lesson in the judicious laying of camera traps.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Natural World']}}, {'sent': 'Giant armadillos reside in deep burrows, and they dig a new one every two days.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'All in all, 80 species have been recorded either dropping by or moving to the Hotel Armadillo, making the giant armadillo', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['80']}}, {'sent': '“The battle to save the giant armadillo is the battle to save biodiversity,” said Desbiez.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Desbiez']}}, {'sent': 'Twitter Pinterest Burrow nursery … a mother tamandua with pup.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Twitter Pinterest Burrow']}}, {'sent': 'The comings and goings of 80 species exponentially increases the odds of something kicking your equipment over in the dead of night.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['80']}}];Positive

Everyone loves turtles.

Turtles and tortoises are often depicted as tranquil creatures possessing wisdom and longevity. These reptiles are indeed ancient survivors with a fossil record dating back over 200 million years. But today, many species are in danger, with more than half of the world’s freshwater turtles and tortoises on the brink of extinction. While some of these species can still be found in small numbers in the wild, they are already “functionally extinct”.

Pollution, hunting, habitat destruction, and over-collection for the burgeoning international pet trade all contribute to the turtle and tortoise population declines we’re witnessing around the world. Much of the trade in chelonians is driven by demand from China, specifically for human consumption and use in traditional medicines. Building assurance colonies of endangered turtles and tortoises in zoos and other conservation organizations, together with fieldwork, can help to mitigate the causes and outcomes of this crisis.

The Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) has committed to help these animals in their time of need. Currently, WCS’s Bronx Zoo Department of Herpetology houses 12 of the 40 most endangered turtles and tortoises in the world. All of them are on IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species.

The turtle and tortoise hatchlings pictured here, some about the size of quarter, are part of assurance colonies at the Bronx Zoo’s World of Reptiles. Nearly all of these species are reproduced according to recommendations from Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ (AZA) Species Survival Plan (SSP) programs. SSPs manage populations of species in AZA zoos and aquariums for genetic viability and demographic stability, in order to ensure that captive populations are healthy and could be safely reintroduced to the wild if needed.

 Western Gorilla;Gorilla gorilla;Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Nigeria;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Primates;Hominidae;Gorilla;gorilla;I;Angola,Cameroon,Central African Republic,Congo,Equatorial Guinea,Gabon,Nigeria;;"Gorillas are territorial and claim 'ownership' of their home ranges while peacefully co-existing with their neighbours, a into their behaviour study finds.

Evolutionary biologists from Anglia Ruskin University studied eight western lowland gorilla groups to find out how they react to incursions in their territory.

The animals co-exist with their neighbouring groups while also claiming 'exclusive use' of the areas close to the central hub of their homes.

The researchers said the findings, published in the journal Scientific Reports, contradict widely-held belief that these primates were non-territorial.

Lead author Dr Robin Morrison said the behaviour of the gorillas is similar to humans and provides some insight into the social evolution of early human populations.

A group of western lowland gorillas were monitored at the Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the Republic of Congo and researchers found they co-existed with neighbours while also defending their 'home ranges'

Dr Robin Morrison, lead author on the study installed cameras around the gorilla habitat to monitor them remotely and get an idea of how they interact with their neighbours

Scientists monitored the movements of 113 gorillas at the Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the Republic of Congo, with cameras across 36 feeding spots

The findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the social structures of gorillas are more complex than previously thought, as interactions between groups are influenced by social and familial relationships and territoriality.

'This new research changes what we know about how groups of gorillas interact and has implications for what we understand about human evolution,' said study author Dr Jacob Dunn.

'Almost all research into human evolution compares us to chimpanzees, with the extreme territorial violence observed in chimpanzees used as evidence that their behaviour provides an evolutionary basis for warfare among humans,' he said.

'Our research broadens this out and shows instead just how closely we compare to our next nearest relatives.'

Gorillas' core areas of dominance and large zones of mutual tolerance could help with our understanding of the social evolution of early human populations.

He said it shows both the capacity for violence in defending a specific territory and the between-group affiliations necessary for wider social cooperation.

Scientists monitored the movements of 113 gorillas at the Odzala-Kokoua National Park in the Republic of Congo, with cameras across 36 feeding spots.

The team found the gorillas' movements were strongly influenced by the location of their neighbours, suggesting these animals may avoid the central hubs of other groups' home ranges to prevent conflict.

Study finds gorillas are territorial and claim 'ownership' of home ranges while also peacefully co-existing with their neighbours in a similar way to humans

The authors said this behaviour is markedly different to chimpanzees, which display extreme territorial-based violence.

Morrison, who carried out the study during her PhD at the University of Cambridge, said the findings show an understanding among gorillas of the idea of 'ownership' of areas and where neighbours reside.

Gorillas don't impose hard boundaries like chimpanzees, she said.

'Instead, gorilla groups may have regions of priority or even exclusive use close to the centre of their home range, which could be defended by physical aggression.

'At the same time groups can overlap and even peacefully co-exist in other regions of their ranges,' Morrison confirmed.

'The flexible system of defending and sharing space implies the presence of a complex social structure in gorillas.'

Cougar Gaming has steadily added to its catalog and repertoire over the last decade plus, by providing chassis, power supplies, gaming peripherals, system fans and liquid cooling AIOs. Their Aqua series of AIOs is touted as a high-performance line of liquid cooling solutions with RGB-accented pumps pushing coolant while the radiators are paired with Vortex Omega fans to move air and dissipate heat.

Cougar sends its Aqua 240 out into the world well-equipped to cover nearly all current-gen Intel and AMD CPUs, save for Threadripper models. A syringe of thermal compound is included, alongside mounting components and brackets. A handheld remote is provided and works by default to control lighting on the pump, or users can opt to integrate lighting with their other RGB-managed devices by means of the 5v pigtail.

Support of the Aqua 240 is covered by Cougar’s 2 year warranty on liquid coolers.

The top of the CPU pump module hosts an opaque white face with RGB lighting accents. The pump itself is SATA powered and rated at 3200 RPM, although there is not a tach or PWM header to manage speed (or measure speed). This defaults the pump to operating at 100% at all times. That’s not really an issue, although some users do value the ability to run their AIO pump from a performance curve.

The RGB pigtail for external lighting control also originates from the CPU pump module, and although the pump face is the only illumination piece on the Aqua 240, the cable does include a splitter if you wish to plug in other RGB devices from here as well.

The coldplate of the Aqua 240 offers a semi-polished copper base, which should adequately provide full coverage of all CPUs supported. The interchangeable mounting brackets slide into place via a groove near the base of the pump module and snap over tabs within the channel itself . This makes simple work of changing between necessary hardware for your specific socket application.

A pair of swivel 90-degree fittings easily pivot to allow for multiple mounting orientations, and the rubber coolant tubing is sleeved with black nylon braid.

Cougar ships the Aqua 240 with a pair of its 120mm Vortex WB fans, which are rated up to 2000 RPM (+/- 10%). The fans ship with rubberized mounting pads for noise isolation when paired with the 240mm aluminum radiator. They are managed via 4-Pin PWN and are devoid of RGB lighting, making cable management during installation a bit simpler overall.

Installation of the Cougar Aqua 240 follows common cadence to most other AIO installs, with mounting posts and the backplate providing a location for tension screws to snug the cooling block against the CPU IHS. Tubing length on the Aqua 240 is an ample 16”/406mm, allowing for easier installation in either top- or front-mount setups. As we mentioned previously, using non-RGB fans simplifies cable management by process of elimination and the lessens excessive wiring spaghetti.

A captive chimpanzee has reunited with her carer who raised it as an infant 40 years ago.

Jessie, a 41-year-old female chimpanzee, recognised the elderly woman when she showed up in front of her enclosure at Wellington Zoo in the capital city of the same name in New Zealand.

Heartwarming footage captured Jessie and her carer's first encounter four decades later.

The carer, whose name has not been revealed, is seen trying to get Jessie’s attention.

Jessie, the matriarch of the zoo's population, appears to recognise the woman and the chimpanzee outstretches her hand for her to ""touch"" through the glass separating them.

Meanwhile, a woman in the background is heard saying “aww” as the pair reconnect.

The zoo posted the clip on its Facebook page and accompanies with a message that read: ""Watch this touching moment between Jessie, our 41-year-old female Chimpanzee and a volunteer that knew her when she was a baby.

""We're not crying, you're crying!""

A spokesperson for Wellington Zoo said: ""Jessie came over pretty quickly and it seemed like she knew her.""

According to reports, Jessie, who turns 42 in July, is Wellington Zoo’s oldest chimpanzee.

Chimpanzees are around six times stronger than humans and are highly intelligent animals, the zoo introduced.

They are able to learn sign language, recognise themselves in the mirror, and can make and use tools.

Research was carried out under approval of the University of Adelaide animal ethics committee (permit: S-2013-095) and according to the University’s animal ethics guidelines. Egg collections around the Gulf St. Vincent were carried out with permission of the South Australian Government Department of Primary Industry and Regions SA (permit: 9902595).

Study species and sample collection

The study species Heterodontus portusjacksoni (Meyer, 1793) is an ideal model species because it is robust to handling stress that could affect their physiology55. It is a medium-sized benthic oviparous shark endemic throughout the southern half of Australia56. It is known to aggregate in groups as juveniles, however, this is also influenced by habitat57. It breeds annually, between the months of September and November, laying a pair of eggs every 10–12 days over 2–3 month period27 and the incubation can last up to a year. H. portusjacksoni lays large eggs containing a single embryo with an average weight of 155.5 g56. A total of 98 eggs were collected from Gulf St. Vincent, South Australia, over two collection dates (7th and 28th June 2013) via snorkelling.

Egg and shark rearing

The collected eggs were held in a temperature-controlled laboratory until hatching. Developmental stages56 were determined for all collected eggs and showed that they were of similar stage (stage 14—at least 7.5 months). The eggs were placed in 40 L tanks containing natural filtered seawater which was partially exchanged every 2–3 days. The tanks were placed in water baths with temperatures maintained using heater chiller units (TR15 Aquarium chillers, TECO refrigeration technologies, Ravenna, Italy) and 300 W glass heaters. Pumps were connected to the chiller units which ensured an even temperature distribution throughout the water baths. The eggs were left to acclimatize over a period of seven days where temperature was steadily increased by 1 °C to the elevated temperature treatment. The eggs were kept in either control (~400 μatm) or elevated CO 2 (~1000 μatm)16,58 crossed with control (~16 °C) or elevated temperature (~19 °C) (Table S4). Eggs were evenly distributed over 4 tanks per treatment with a max density of 9 eggs per tank. Exposure time of the embryos varied from an average of 108 days for the elevated temperature treatment to 143 days for the lower temperature treatments (hatching rate was affected by temperature which affected embryonic exposure time).

Upon hatching the juvenile sharks were relocated to new tanks with the exact same treatment set-up as described above, again with 4 tanks per treatment. The sharks were placed into large tubs of 100 L or 150 L in volume. The number of sharks in each of the tanks ranged from 1–8 for the 150 L tanks and 1–4 for the 100 L tanks (differing numbers due to differences in hatching time and because at some point 33 sharks were removed for the subsequent mesocosm experiment). Sharks were kept in their respective treatments for at least 2 months. Water parameters (Table S4) were measured daily. Tanks received water changes every other day (minimum 40% of total volume). Sharks were fed ad libidum with thawed frozen prawns daily.

A PEGAS 4000 MF Gas Mixer (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, Ohio) was used to achieve different CO 2 concentrations in the seawater by bubbling the CO 2 enriched air directly into the tanks. The gas mixer was connected to a CO 2 tank and an air compressor. Temperature and pH NBS of each tank was measured daily using a pH and temperature meter (Mettler Toledo SevenGo™ SG2) calibrated with fresh buffers each day. Additionally, oxygen and salinity were also measured daily within the tanks. Total alkalinity of seawater was estimated by Gran titration (888 Titrando, Metrohm, Switzerland) from water samples taken weekly from each of the treatment tanks. Alkalinity standards were accurate within 1% of certified reference material from Dr A. Dickson (Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Langdon et al. 2000). Average seawater pCO 2 (Table S4) was calculated using CO2SYS with the constants of Mehbrach et al.59 refit by Dickson and Milero60. The variability in pCO 2 is higher than for pH because it was calculated using weekly measurements of total alkalinity, whereas pH was measured on a daily basis.

Hatching rate, feeding and growth measurements in the laboratory

The tanks holding the eggs were checked daily for new hatchlings. As soon as new hatchlings were observed, their weight and sex was recorded as well as a photo taken of each individual for future identification. The newly hatched shark was then placed into a new tank with the same CO 2 and temperature treatment as it experienced while still in the egg. The sharks were measured each week for changes in weight (±1 g) and also photographed to aid identification of individuals to track their growth for the duration of the experiment. Sharks were fed ad libidum with mussels and prawn meat during the first month after hatching and afterwards with prawn meat alone. Food consumption was recorded daily by comparing the difference in weight of food offered and food remaining after 30 minutes of feeding. Thirty minutes was selected as the end period because this was well beyond the time it took sharks to feed to satiation (usually ~10 min). Because multiple sharks were kept in a tank, food consumption was calculated at the level of tanks and divided by the number of sharks in the respective tank. This was deemed as a fair representation of individual shark consumption rates because leftover food in the tanks indicated they were all fully fed and competition for food resources was unlikely to take place because food was not limiting. Although Port Jackson sharks usually feed at night, our sharks were conditioned to feed during the day directly upon hatching and therefore we expect this to represent true demand of food intake.

Growth in mesocosm experiments

After the laboratory experiment, a subset of the sharks was relocated to a mesocosm setup in South Australia. Three sharks were placed in each of the 12 mesocosm tanks (2,000 L volume each) which were manipulated to mimic a shallow temperate reef habitat (n = 3 sharks for each control and treatment mesocosm, see Table S4). The mesocosms had the same crossed design of elevated CO 2 and temperature as the laboratory experiments with 3 replicate mesocosm per treatment (Table S4). Each mesocosm had the same biological set up which included 5 kelp plants (Ecklonia radiata) with an average weight of 250 g per plant, a single spiny rock lobster (Jasus edwardsii) of ~2 kg in weight, 1 crab (Ozius truncatus), 15 snails (Turbo undulatus), 6 urchins (Heliocidarcis erythrogramma) and amphipods (>1,000). The kelp, snails and urchins were replenished 3 times over the duration of the experiment (68 days) as needed. The snails, crab, lobster and urchins were too large for the sharks to consume and their primary food source was the amphipods that successfully populated and reproduced within the tanks. Turf algae started growing naturally and covered the major part of the substratum in the mesocosms. The mesocosms had a flow-through system using natural seawater filtered through a sand filter. Temperatures were manipulated using external heater/chiller units (TC60 Aquarium chillers, TECO refrigeration technologies, Ravenna, Italy). The same thermal mass flow meter/controller as in the laboratory experiments was used to achieve an elevated CO 2 concentration in the seawater of the mesocosm via bubbling of enriched air directly into the tanks and both temperature and pH were measured daily.

The sharks were measured individually for total weight and photographed (to aid with the identification and tracking of individual growth for the duration of the experiment) prior to placement in the mesocosms. Sharks were re-measured after 61 days and after 68 days at the end of the experiment. During the first two weeks of the experiment, the sharks in both high temperature treatments were fed 2 g of fresh prawn meat, whereas sharks in both ambient temperature treatments were fed 1 g of meat each. These were similar to the food intake quantities as measured in the laboratory prior to placement into the mesocosms. This served as an acclimation period during which the sharks could familiarize themselves with the natural prey items in the mesocosms. After 2 weeks the feeding was standardized to 1 g per shark for all treatments. Due to the lowered food provisioning and due to their continuing increase in growth, the sharks increased their reliance on foraging on natural prey in the mesocosms such as amphipods. Observations showed shark foraging in-between the turf algae (which occupied most of the substratum and vertical tank walls of the mesocosms). Biomass of amphipods was not enhanced in the control treatments compared to the elevated CO 2 /temperature treatments (single sampling event of total weight and numbers of all amphipods found on the kelp: Control = 0.06 g, n = 124, Temperature = 0.06 g, n = 56, CO 2 = 0.09 g, n = 86 and T × CO 2 = 0.05 g, n =114) and could therefore not have been responsible for the observed reductions in growth rates in the latter treatments. There were no large differences in growth between the three sharks in one tank (this was the same for all tanks and no shark was observed to compete while feeding individually).

Hunting behaviour in mesocosm experiments

After an average 36-day exposure (range: 35–38 days because sharks were introduced into the mesocosms over a 4 day interval) to the experimental treatments in the mesocosms, the effect of elevated CO 2 on shark prey hunting behaviour through olfaction was tested. Prior to the day of testing the sharks were not fed, although they were still able to obtain prey (amphipods) from the tanks. Nevertheless, the sharks showed high degree of motivation towards the food offered in the olfactory trial the next day. The olfaction tests consisted of placing two equally sized (33 × 23 × 5 cm) sand-filled trays within each of the mesocosms. One tray (i.e. the food tray) had a combination of prawn meat (4 equally sized pieces of approx. 1 g each) and 5 fresh cockles of equal size (still in their shell but opened), buried into the sand. The control tray contained no food but had 5 empty and cleaned out cockle shells buried in the sand to reduce any visual bias of the slightly exposed top ends of the shell in the food tray. Both trays were placed near each other (average distance of 5 cm between the trays) and the shark responses were recorded using a GoPro HD HERO3 video camera (white edition) for a period of 40 min. The recordings were then analysed to determine the length of time it took for each shark to locate the hidden food and to determine the number of sharks that responded to the introduction of the prey. The timer started counting from the moment the trays were lowered onto the bottom of the mesocosm until the time each shark found the hidden prey items in the tray and started retrieving them from the sand or until the end of the experiment (after 40 minutes). Although Port Jackson sharks are nocturnal feeders these sharks were accustomed since birth to being fed during the day and responded actively when food was offered. It was possible to distinguish individual sharks within each mesocosm due to the markings on their upper bodies between the eyes, first dorsal and pectoral fins. These areas showed the most variation in patterning between sharks and remained consistent from hatching (photos were taken weekly after hatching).

It's reality that the usual excitement and joy of spring birding will be heavily tempered in the coming weeks. As social distancing and self-isolation have become a stark necessity seemingly overnight – and we may yet have a few weeks of birding exclusively from our homes – it goes without saying that common sense in regard to twitching must be adopted by all in these trying times. With a run of easterlies forecast towards the end of the month, things could get challenging … but we should all bear in mind government advice and act responsibly and compassionately, regardless of how gripping things might become.

News of spring arrivals will always put a smile on the faces of birders, though, and the seasonal shift was evident this week. Notable was a fall, mainly on the south coast, on Monday of Northern Wheatears, among other bits. We received hundreds of reports of this harbinger of spring just on 16th, including an incredible 232 from Dorset alone … other notable spring returns have included a Little Ringed Plover arrival over the weekend, plus a few more hirundines, White Wagtails and the first singing Willow Warblers.

As it happened, our third weekly review of the third month of the year produced three outstanding rarity finds. Pick of the bunch was a gorgeous male Lesser Kestrel, which was photographed at Porth Hellick Down, St Mary's, Scilly, on 7th but identified on 15th. There have been barely more than 20 Lesser Kestrel records in Britain (11 since 1950) and the last twitchable bird was at Minsmere in 2010, which was also in March. The bird was still present on 17th and Scilly will take this excellent start to spring – just a fourth record for the archipelago.



Lesser Kestrel, St Mary's, Isles of Scilly (Scott Reid).

Some 179 km to the north-east of St Mary's, as the falcon (or plover) flies, is Lundy, which was the home of Devon's fourth Killdeer on 16th. Despite turning up in Britain no fewer than 14 times between 2000 and 2010, there have only been three records since, rendering this characterful Charadrius rather desirable. However, with no ships sailing to the island and things as they are generally, a twitch was never realistic – as it happens, the bird hasn't been seen since.

The other headliner was a Short-toed Treecreeper at where else but Dungeness, Kent. England's Garden has hosted a silly 78% of Britain's records of this continental species and with this bird favouring a small garden and sometimes showing well, the relatively small congregation of birders comfortably kept to the recommended social-distance requirements of 2 metres apart. The arrival in a similar location of a 'creeper with a preference for walls might pose significantly greater issues.

In terms of long-stayers, gulls headlined proceedings. Out west, the Laughing Gull continued to drop in with some regularity at Chew Valley Lake, Somerset, relocating to Cheddar Reservoir on 16-17th, though the Ross's Gull on the Plym Estuary, Devon, continued to be a little mobile before flying downriver on 15th, not to be seen again.

In Ireland, the American Herring Gull continued in Sligo Harbour, but the Co Cork bird seems to have departed. However, the adult Bonaparte's Gull remained in Co Wexford. The Forster's Tern also put in a cameo at Kinvarra, Co Galway, on 14th.

The Shetland Tengmalm's Owl relocated from Lea Gardens to Lyndsey Lea Plantation, where it was discovered on 15th, though it seems off the cards for anyone from outside the islands for a while.

In terms of rare passerines, both Black-throated Thrushes made it into another weekly review, as did the Cheshire Siberian Stonechat. Buckinghamshire enjoyed a rare moment in the limelight when a male Black-bellied Dipper appeared near High Wycombe on 12th, favouring a waterfall on The Dyke. It proved popular until Tuesday, when there were no reports. Should it resurface, birders are reminded to view from the roadbridge only and not via Crown House School …

The usual rare duck line-up was still on offer: the Blue-winged Teal in Devon, White-winged Scoter in Lothian, Black Scoter in Northumberland, King Eider in Moray & Nairn, American Black Duck in Highland and Ferruginous Duck in West Midlands and Hampshire. The Pied-billed Grebe battled on in Argyll, too.

Richardson's Cackling Geese continued on the Outer Hebrides and Argyll, the Grey-bellied Brant was still to be found in Lancashire and the three Long-billed Dowitchers – in Devon, Co Wexford and Co Wicklow – stood firm for another week.



Scottish mainland

There was a distinct end-of-winter feel, with a small cohort of wintering wildfowl still lingering and just a glimmer of spring as the week rolled to a close. The Snow Goose was again at New Cumnock, Clyde, two settled American Wigeon were in the northern half of the country at Loch Eye, Highland and Fedderate Reservoir, Aberdeenshire, drake Surf Scoter remained off Embo, Highland and Musselburgh, Lothian respectively and the long-staying Smew was still at Lochwinnoch RSPB, Clyde.

Scotland's two hardy Great Egrets showed no ill effects from a winter of social isolation and continued to hang out at Forfar Loch, Angus, and Auchenreoach Loch, Dumfries & Galloway. The Great Grey Shrike remained quarantined in the Brawlbin Forest, Highland.

Iceland and Glaucous Gulls numbered around a half-dozen of each, with most individuals that have been seen regularly throughout the winter. Waxwing numbers echoed the ebbing of winter with 21 at Banchory, Aberdeenshire, this week's peak count. And so to spring: two Sandwich Terns off Moray & Nairn and Borders coasts offered the tiniest hints of better days ahead, as did the a White Wagtail at Reston, Borders, as the week ended.



Northern Isles and the Hebrides

On the Shetland mainland, South Nesting Bay continued to host a White-billed Diver, while Fair Isle had a flyover White-tailed Eagle. White-winged gulls hung on in small numbers, with up to five Iceland Gulls in circulation and four Glaucous Gulls. It was quiet week in Orkney, with the drake Green-winged Teal on North Ronaldsay reported once.



Tengmalm's Owl, Kergord, Mainland, Shetland (Rebecca Nason).

The Outer Hebrides faired little better, with a Snow Goose still on North Uist and a Ring-necked Duck remaining on Barra. There was a little more gull action, with peaks of seven Glaucous and four Iceland Gulls in the week.

Drake Green-winged Teal on Islay and two Ring-necked Duck on Tiree were the highlights further south.

North-East England

Last week's Great Grey Shrike remained at Trimdon, Durham, for most of the week and the Far Pastures NR Siberian Chiffchaff began to sing. As the week ended, a White-tailed Eagle flew south over Boldon Flats and was tracked along the River Wear as far as Washington WWT. Two Iceland Gulls were recorded at Seaham and Whitburn Coastal Park respectively.

Cleveland's Ruddy Shelduck continued to buddy up with Eurasian Wigeon over the weekend. An immature Glaucous Gull was noted at Saltholme RSPB and a Lapland Bunting flew north at Skinningrove, while a male Black Redstart was well received at South Gare.

A smart drake Ring-necked Duck at Caistron NR appears to have been a one-day bird, disappearing faster than a delivery of toilet roll to Asda. On the coast, the Hadston and Amble area yielded a couple of fly-over records of up to three Common Cranes, while the wintering adult remained at Middleton. Also hanging about were the drake American Wigeon at Grindon Lough, juvenile Iceland Gull at North Shields and Great Grey Shrike at Kirkharle.

North-West England

A Todd's Canada Goose at Rockcliffe Marsh on 15th proved to be Cumbria's bird of the week. Another was still being seen further south at Crossens Outer Marsh, Lancashire. Also here, Tundra Bean and Greenland White-fronted Geese made an appearance among the hordes of Pink-feet. To round up the wildfowl theme, there was an adult Bewick's Swan was at Upper Thurnham on 11th and a drake Green-winged Teal at Crossens Marsh on 16th.

Mid-March usually signals the return of Woolston Eyes' Black-necked Grebes, so the birds arriving on 14th was a typical date and by the end of the week six were settling down, with the single still present at Lapwing Hall Pool until the 15th. Elsewhere, two Western Cattle Egrets were again at Burton Mere Wetlands RSPB and an adult Eurasian Spoonbill arrived back on the 17th.

In Greater Manchester, Winter Hill had a welcome site first on 17th in the form of five high-flying Red-throated Divers – a super vis-mig record. Two different adult Iceland Gulls were attending the evening roost at Pennington Flash CP, where a Sandwich Tern paid a brief visit before continuing west.



Lincolnshire and Yorkshire

A Hooded Crow flew over Gibraltar Point, Lincs, where up to 83 Water Pipits remained. Further up the coast, a Siberian Chiffchaff was at Anderby Creek on 13th. Four Black-necked Grebes called in at Toft Newton Reservoir on 14th, while migrants included the first Northern Wheatear at Woodhall Spa Airfield on 17th and a Black Redstart at East Halton Skitter on 16th.

The Black Brant remained in the Spurn area, where early spring migrants included Firecrests and a Ring Ouzel. A Green-winged Teal was at Bubwith Ings on 16th, while a group of Waxwings entertained in Hessle and the Richard's Pipit hung on at Flamborough Head, where two Common Cranes flew south on 11th (they were also seen over Filey).

The Ring-necked Duck stuck around at Bolton-on-Swale Lake YWT, North Yorkshire, as did the drake at Long Preston Deeps and the Lesser Yellowlegs at Nosterfield. On the coast, at least one Hooded Crow was in the Reighton area.

Eurasian Spoonbills are back at Fairburn Ings, West Yorks, for another summer; other sightings in the area included the continuing Long-tailed Duck at Wintersett Reservoir and a Siberian Chiffchaff at Calder Wetlands. Another Sibe Chiff and the continuing Great Grey Shrike were at Hatfield Moors, South Yorks.

West Midlands

Gulls, gulls, gulls … this was the theme of the week in Worcestershire. The regular Glaucous Gull continued its routine of feeding up at Upton Snodsbury before sleeping it off at Upton Warren NR while, elsewhere, a juvenile Iceland Gull roosted at Clifton Pits on 11th. An adult Little Gull was also there for two days from 14th, and an adult Kittiwake turned up at Upton Warren the following day, albeit in bad health.

The Draycote Water roost continued to produce the adult Iceland Gull and multiple Caspian Gulls were also noted. The Black-necked Grebe was joined by a second on 13th and up to four Greater Scaup remained.

The drake Green-winged Teal was again seen at Wall Farm NR, Shropshire, on 11th but no subsequent reports followed – perhaps it's the Lancashire bird? A White Wagtail was noted on floods at Whixall Moss. The familiar Cannock Chase Great Grey Shrike continues to fly Staffordshire's flag.



Great Grey Shrike, Cannock Chase, Staffordshire (Ron Marshall).

East Midlands

A Brent Goose rocked up at Clifford Hill GPs, Northants on 17th and up to five Western Cattle Egrets were still at Stanwick GPs.

In Nottinghamshire, Holme Pierrepoint held onto its Red-necked Grebe, Long-tailed Duck and up to three Smew. The Slavonian Grebe at Attenborough NR made a re-appearance on 11th and a Eurasian Spoonbill was seen briefly on 16th.

Four Waxwings were still at Willington, Derbyshire on 13th, with Bleaklow scoring a Snow Bunting that day. Both Great Northern Divers were still being seen at Carsington Water, where the region's first Little Ringed Plover of the year turned up on 14th. An adult Kittiwake on 13th and Black-necked Grebe the following day were also notable.

The first migrants of the year always provide joy, so it was pleasing to hear Rutland Water welcomed back its first Western Osprey on 13th. Other than a Kittiwake on 14th, it was a standard pick of the bunch otherwise, with scarce grebes present and correct, plus up to 12 Smew still.

East of England

In Norfolk, arriving migrants included a pair of Garganey at Holme-next-the-Sea and the first Northern Wheatear at Cley on 15th. Sightings otherwise involved familiar long stayers, such as the Great Grey Shrike at Fincham, Rough-legged Buzzard at Wells-next-the-Sea (another reported over Kelling Heath on 16th), Shore Larks at Holkham Gap, plus Caspian Gulls at Sheringham and Thetford.



Waxwing, Wangford, Suffolk (Andrew Moon).

A Ring Ouzel showed up at Great Livermere, Suffolk, on 15th, while Northern Wheatears adorned the coast from 16th. Groups of Waxwings were at Wangford and Eyke, while Tundra Bean Geese were at Covehithe Broad (one) and Trimley Marshes (two).

An early Swallow was over Tollesbury, Essex, on 16th, but it was a quiet week in general in the county. Four Waxwings were at Thornwood Common on 17th and the two Western Cattle Egrets continued to tour the Lee Valley. Abberton Reservoir retained just a single Smew.

The Ring-necked Duck stayed another week at Priory CP, Beds, as did the Dartford Warbler at Houghton Regis Pits. Several sites in the county logged Northern Wheatears on 16-17th. A Western Osprey flew over Panshanger Park, Herts, on 16th – the first in the county this year.

An early Willow Warbler sang at Etton, Cambs, on 16th, while Sand Martins were 'in' in small numbers by the end of the week. A trio of Smew hung on at Bainton GPs and an Iceland Gull roosted at Fen Drayton GPs on a few dates.

South-East England

Hampshire got in on the Northern Wheatear fall on 16th, with many sites logging birds. An early Western Osprey flew over Totton on 11th. The New Forest Great Grey Shrike was still present, as was the Great Bustard at Pennington Marshes. Some 46 Northern Wheatears were reported on the Isle of Wight on 16th, including 25 at West High Down.

Berkshire enjoyed its first Little Ringed Plovers on 14th (at Queen Mother Reservoir), and a dubious White Stork was at Lower Basildon on 16th. The released, roaming White-tailed Eagle was seen over the M40 near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on 17th and, in the same county, the Ring Ouzel remained at Pitstone Hill. A Black-throated Diver was a great record for Oxfordshire, with one at Farmoor on 15th, though it didn't linger and flew off north. The following day a Willow Warbler was singing at Otmoor. The Garganey remained at Standlake, three Avocets were at Sutton Courtenay GPs on 14th and a Rock Pipit was at Farmoor on the same day.



Glaucous Gull, Dungeness NNR, Kent (Richard Smith).

In the capital, the Mitcham Yellow-browed Warbler hung on for most of the week, though there was no sign on 17th. Two Iceland Gulls were knocking about, and the drake Smew was still on King George V Reservoir. A group of up to seven Waxwings were at Croydon on 12th, with two present the following day and one on 15th. Interestingly, two released White Storks from the Knepp reintroduction scheme in Sussex appeared over Rainham Marshes then at Crayford on 13th – presumably having returned to our shores after a winter somewhere warmer. Still present in the morning, they were seen in flight, heading south, over Trent CP in north London on 14th, before pitching up at Papercourt Water Meadows, Surrey, the next day. They then flew west over Tice's Meadow, Surrey, on 16th – will they return to Knepp to breed?

Elsewhere in Surrey, the Frensham Common Great Grey Shrike lingered until the start of this week, but has seemingly gone (or just vanished again). The other shrike reappeared on Ash Ranges on 12-13th. Also, the two Great Northern Divers remained at Island Barn Reservoir, two White Wagtails were at Shackleford on 17th and a Little Gull dropped in at Tice's Meadow on 16th.

West Sussex cashed in on the Northern Wheatear fall on 16th, with 18 sites logging the species. On 16th, two White Wagtails were at Goring Gap, and on 16th a smart trio of three Garganey arrived at Pagham Harbour, where up to 23 Western Cattle Egrets could be seen during the week. Elsewhere, Pulborough Brooks enjoyed another Brent Goose. In East Sussex, a pair of Common Cranes were tracked as they followed the coast west, being logged at Pett Level, Bexhill, Eastbourne and East Dean. Also, a Kittiwake was at Weir Wood Reservoir on 13th, the Glossy Ibis reappeared at Rye Harbour on 15th and seven Garganey flew past Beachy Head on 15th. There was a House Martin at Hastings on 16th.

Finally, it was rather quiet in Kent, spring arrivals aside: the two Tundra Bean Goose remained in the far east of the county and both Red-necked Grebes were still on offer. The Glaucous Gull remained at Dungeness, too.

South-West England

There were spring signs in Cornwall, with the county bagging records of Swallow, House Martin and Western Osprey. The Lesser Scaup remained at Stithians Reservoir, as did the Ring-necked Duck at Siblyback Reservoir. An adult Kumlien's Gull flew over Polgigga on 16th, while the lingering Ring-billed Gull was still on the Hayle. Three Glaucous and singles of Caspian and Iceland Gulls were also on offer. A Curlew Sandpiper was on the Camel Estuary on 11th.

Alongside a pleasant early spring list of migrants, Devon enjoyed a particularly good week on the scarcity front, too. An adult drake Surf Scoter was in Labrador Bay from 14th – a smart find – while two Hooded Crows were on Lundy on 13th. At Ilfracombe, a third-winter Glaucous Gull was logged. Elsewhere, the Ring-necked Duck and Green-winged Teal remained.

An incredible 232 Northern Wheatears were reported to us from Dorset on Monday, with no fewer than 125 of those on Portland – amazing stuff, with 100+ Common Chiffchaffs and 40+ European Stonechats also chalked up on the isle that day, along with Black Redstarts, Firecrests, Swallows and White Wagtails … it sounded like a fine day to be in the field. Longham Lakes and Sturminster GP both hosted the commuting Ring-necked Duck, the Great Grey Shrike continued at Morden Bog and the Eurasian Penduline Tit was still to be found at Radipole Lake.



Ring-necked Duck, Chew Valley Lake, Somerset & Bristol (Chris Teague).

Impressively, there were two new Ring-billed Gulls found in Somerset: an adult at Porlock on 14th and a second-winter at Cheddar Reservoir and Lower Weare from 16th. A drake Ring-necked Duck was also new at Chew Valley Lake from 13-15th, while the Kentish Plover continued at Burnham-on-Sea. News of a first-winter Rosy Starling in a garden at East Brent on 13th came as a bit of a surprise, as did the report of Britain's first Common Cuckoo at Hamsford Water on 16th.

In Gloucestershire, a near-adult Iceland Gull entertained at Slimbridge on 13th and the Great Grey Shrike remained at Crabtree Hill throughout. A flyover Common Crane was a decent record at Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, on 17th.

Wales

Migrants continued to arrive, with Sand Martins and Northern Wheatears logged in reasonable numbers for this early stage. The first-winter Rosy Starling was performing at Llanfaethlu throughout the week, and on 15th Bardsey Island logged its first Manx Shearwater of the season.

Great Grey Shrikes remained omnipresent, with four sites in the south and one in the north scoring. The Glossy Ibis lingered for another week at Newport Wetlands, Gwent, and over in Glamorgan the juvenile Kumlien's Gull showed at Aberavon.

All was quiet on the wildfowl front: just a single drake Ring-necked Duck was reported at Llyn Pendam, Ceredigion and Anglesey's wintering Greenland White-fronted Geese were still at Llyn Llywenan – perhaps providing some eye-candy for those twitching the starling.



Republic of Ireland

The first Northern Wheatears appeared in Cos Wexford and Wicklow on 16th, with more following on 17th – one of which even reached Co Donegal.

Wildfowl highlight was the Tundra Bean Goose still at Nobber, Co Meath, although – not to everyone's taste – a drake Red-crested Pochard on a pond on the outskirts of Dublin caused a bit of a stir, for it's a rare bird in Ireland. The Surf Scoter was still off Gleninagh Quay, Co Clare, with another drake found off Cromane, Co Kerry, on 16th.

Three Ring-necked Duck were still at Lough Atariff, Co Cork, with the female still at Cloonee Lakes, Co Kerry, and the drake at Lough Fern, Co Donegal. On Achill Island, Co Mayo, the drake Lesser Scaup was seen again on 14th, where the Green-winged Teal also remained. Another of the latter hung on at East Coast NR, Co Wicklow, where the American Wigeon was also still present.



Red-crested Pochard, Dublin, Dublin (Grzegorz Burkowski).

A first-winter Ring-billed Gull was a nice find at The Gearagh, Co Cork, on 15th, while a couple were seen around Cork City, the adult remained at Tralee, Co Kerry, and a second bird arrived in Sligo, where the usual Doorly Park bird hung on. An adult Kumlien's Gull was at Dingle, Co Kerry, with at least one more in Tralee. Peak count of Iceland Gulls was seven at Killybegs, Co Donegal, where there were also four Glaucous Gulls.

Other bits included a Red-necked Grebe off Mountcharles, Co Donegal, on 15th and the continuing Glossy Ibis at Pilmore, Co Cork.

Northern Ireland

Things remained very quiet in the nation, with adult Ring-billed Gulls still on offer at Belfast Waterworks and Carrickfergus harbour, as well as the Water Pipit at Portavogie, Co Down.

A small flock of Waxwings were at Springwell Forest, Co Derry, on 17th, while a few groups of Pink-footed Geese were scattered around, suggesting migrant birds on their way back to Iceland.

Western Palearctic

It was a relatively quiet week around the region by recent standards, although this was no doubt contributed to by the restrictions on movement (and, in some nations, even leaving the confines of your own property). Nonetheless there were a few snippets of significant news, not least the discovery of a Golden Nightjar at Merzouga, Morocco, on 13th – the first record from this region of the country, and perhaps the most northerly ever.

The Canary Islands' good run continued with an adult Cape Gull at Puerto de la Cruz, in the south-west of Fuerteventura, on 15th – a first for the archipelago. In addition, the Eastern Yellow Wagtail remained that at Morro Jable and an Iceland Gull was on Tenerife on 13th.



Isabelline Shrike, Coto Doñana, Andalucia (Tim Marshall).

Much closer to home, a Zitting Cisticola on Alderney on 17th was a bit of a gripper four south-coast English birders. This species has gone very rare again on British shores. German news included the continuing Baikal Teal in Lower Saxony and Black Scoter in Schleswig-Holstein, plus a Sociable Lapwing at Memmingen, Bavaria. Neighbouring Austria was treated to its ninth Pallas's Gull, a first-winter, at Hohenau an der March on 15-16th. Another Sociable Lapwing was at Baks, Hungary, on 16th.

An adult Franklin's Gull was at Zoetermeer, The Netherlands, on 16th, while the Oriental Turtle Dove was still at Sneek and the Pied Crow in Leeuwarden. The Green-headed Wagtail was still at Trelleborg, Sweden, on 11th.

“When I first saw the clouded leopards from a distance I thought it was just some macaques on the road,” he told Mongabay. “Once I realized that it was actually three clouded leopards I stopped the car right away. I had my camera close by, but with only a 15mm macro lens attached. I wasn’t sure whether to just enjoy the moment or go into the boot of the car and change lenses. I figured I would regret it badly if I didn’t record it.”

The Sunda clouded leopard, found only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, is such a rare and elusive big cat that it’s traditionally been rather difficult to study, never mind casually sight while driving through the forest.

On the afternoon of November 6, while traveling through Deramakot Forest Reserve in the Malaysian state of Sabah on the island of Borneo, photographer Michael Gordon came across a sight he was not expecting: a Sunda clouded leopard mother with her cubs.

Clouded leopards are known to use logging roads to travel, as the roads are easier to traverse than dense tropical forest underbrush. Still, the sighting was so unexpected that Gordon wasn’t at first sure what he was seeing.

“When I first saw the clouded leopards from a distance I thought it was just some macaques on the road,” he told Mongabay. “Once I realized that it was actually three clouded leopards I stopped the car right away. I had my camera close by, but with only a 15mm macro lens attached. I wasn’t sure whether to just enjoy the moment or go into the boot of the car and change lenses. I figured I would regret it badly if I didn’t record it.”

Once he’d changed the lens, Gordon set the camera down on the front of his car and placed the lens between his feet to try and give the camera some stability. “The mother looked straight at me for a while, and once she must have deemed me safe, the cubs followed her across the road,” he said.

You can watch the resulting footage here:

The Sunda clouded leopard, found only on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, is such a rare and elusive big cat that it’s traditionally been rather difficult to study, never mind casually sight while driving through the forest.

It was only in 2006 that DNA analysis was at last able to establish the Sunda clouded leopard as its own species, Neofelis diardi, distinct from its mainland cousin, Neofelis nebulosa. (Though the two species look and behave remarkably similar, they actually diverged from their common ancestor over a million years ago and are not any more genetically similar to each other than they are to any of the other big cat species.)

The advent of modern conservation technologies like camera traps have helped scientists to gain a better understanding of Sunda clouded leopard populations and behaviors, but even still, some researchers who focus on the species have never seen one of the cats in the wild, or only rarely encountered them.

Which makes it all the more remarkable that Gordon was able to capture the footage of a mother clouded leopard with her cubs. “I have never seen a mother with cubs before and only once had a glimpse of a clouded leopard in the daylight,” Gordon told Mongabay. “This was definitely a rare sighting.”

The Sunda clouded leopard is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species based on a 2015 assessment that found that ongoing threats such as forest loss, habitat degradation, and poaching have likely led to a population decline of 30 percent or more over the past two decades. It is believed that the total Sunda clouded leopard population is currently less than 10,000 individuals.

While scientists have determined that the species exists at relatively low population densities in the forests of Borneo and Sumatra, the Sunda clouded leopard is a fairly adaptable creature, “found in a range of forest types, elevations and levels of disturbance,” the IUCN reports. However, despite its ability to adjust to different habitats, the Sunda clouded leopard is dependent on forests, and does not seem capable of thriving on oil palm plantations. That presents quite a threat to the species’ survival — it’s been estimated that there are only about 700 Sunda clouded leopards left in the wild in Sabah, for instance, mostly due to the conversion of their habitat to oil palm monocultures.

“The forests of Borneo and Sumatra are undergoing some of the world’s highest deforestation rates, largely as the result of the expansion of oil palm plantations, and thus such development and consequent loss of habitat, coupled with the species’ apparent low population size, probably constitute the greatest threat to this species,” according to the IUCN’s assessment.

In addition to habitat destruction, hunting is a serious threat to the big cats. Surveys released by WWF and TRAFFIC earlier this month found that clouded leopards are among the top 10 species targeted for the illegal wildlife trade in Southeast Asia’s Golden Triangle region.

But a sighting of clouded leopards in a selectively logged forest like Deramakot may not be as unusual as it would seem. Recent research found that, contrary to conventional wisdom, mammal populations in Malaysian Borneo’s logged tropical forests are actually higher than in old-growth forests where hunting is a concern. “What was more surprising was that this pattern was so widespread across the mammal species we looked at, including some of those that partly make their living in the treetops, like orangutans and clouded leopards,” Oliver Wearn of the Zoological Society of London, who led the research, told Mongabay in August.

Michael Gordon has lived in Sabah for five years now, and has been working to promote ecotourism in the Dermakot Forest Reserve, an FSC-certified forest landscape. “In a sustainably logged forest like Deramakot there does seem to be higher mammal density than primary forests, and, from a tourism perspective, with the well-maintained roads, it’s actually easier to go out and find them,” he said. “With the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak both pledging to make all logging FSC certified and sustainable, it should ensure some of Borneo’s iconic species do have a future without just being confined to national parks.”

Of course, not everyone is as thrilled by a clouded leopard sighting as Gordon was. Take, for instance, the gibbons and monkeys who were caught on camera earlier this year teaming up to “predator mob” a Sunda clouded leopard they discovered in their midst.

Name: Brexit breeding.

Age: Very much of its time.

Appearance: Varies, but you know it when you see it.

People are having sex because of Brexit? Not people. Animals.

What kind of animals? Okapis, bonobos, zebras ... zoo animals, basically.

You mean Brexit is giving captive species the horn? To be fair, a lot of them had horns already.

It’s the end of the world. I knew it. Don’t panic. It’s not an End Times orgy, just an accelerated mating schedule. Shepreth wildlife park in Hertfordshire, for example, has taken early delivery of a red panda, an aardvark, a maned wolf, a pygmy slow loris and a pair of Von der Decken’s hornbills, all for breeding purposes.

Why the big hurry? Because of difficulties surrounding the transport of animals from EU countries in the event of a no-deal Brexit. European zoos may be reluctant to send their animals if normal routes and procedures are disrupted.

What exactly is the issue with transport? If no-deal comes to pass, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs intends to stop zoo animals entering the country through Kent, in order to avoid massive tailbacks. They will have to go via Harwich in Essex instead, which could mean journey times of 20 hours or longer. Zoo keepers fear this could cause suffering and even put animals at risk.

Should they not have seen this coming? They did. Back in March, before the last no-deal deadline loomed, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) was advising the hasty shipment of animals to and from Britain. Enclosures were thrown up and furious breeding has been taking place all summer ahead of a possible dry spell.

I’m no zoologist or economist, but can we not just trade our sexy beasts with other countries under WTO rules? EAZA’s breeding populations are spread across 350 zoos across Europe, 40 of which are in the UK.

Sounds like more propaganda from Project Fear. True. Already one European zoo has refused to send over an oryx, because they feared they might not get it back.

You know what really threatens endangered species? Pessimism! You’re right: it may never happen. At this rate, the Tories could become extinct first.

It is one of a number of recommended coronavirus treatments—both traditional and Western—on a list published March 4 by China’s National Health Commission, the government body responsible for national health policy. This recommendation highlights what wildlife advocates say is a contradictory approach to wildlife: shutting down the live trade in animals for food on the one hand and promoting the trade in animal parts on the other.

Secreted by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, bile from various species of bears, including Asiatic black bears and brown bears, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine since at least the eighth century. It contains high levels of ursodeoxycholic acid, also known as ursodiol, which is clinically proven to help dissolve gallstones and treat liver disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid has been available as a synthetic drug worldwide for decades.

Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners typically use Tan Re Qing to treat bronchitis and upper respiratory infections. Clifford Steer, a professor at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, has studied the medical benefits of ursodeoxycholic acid. He knows of no evidence that bear bile is an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus. But, he says, ursodeoxycholic acid is distinct from other bile acids in its ability to keep cells alive and may alleviate symptoms of COVID-19 because of its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to calm the immune response.

Enacted in 1989, China’s wildlife protection law sees wild animals as a resource to be used for the benefit of humans. In 2016, it was amended to further legitimize the commercial use of wildlife, asserting explicitly that animals can be used for traditional Chinese medicine, Humane Society International’s China policy specialist Peter Li wrote at the time.

Although use of bear bile from captive animals is legal in China, bile from wild bears is banned, as is the import of bear bile from other countries. According to Aron White, wildlife campaigner for the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA)—a nonprofit based in London, England, that exposes wildlife crimes—his organization learned first about the Chinese government’s recommendations to treat COVID-19 via social media posts from illegal traders.

“We were witnessing how this government recommendation was being coopted by the traffickers to advertise their illegal products as a treatment,” White says. Illegal bile from wild bears is produced in China, he says, and is also imported from wild and captive bears in Laos, Vietnam, and North Korea. The illegal trade persists even though Asiatic black bears, one of the species most commonly farmed for their bile, are protected from international commercial trade under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which regulates cross-border trade of wildlife and wildlife products.

Wildlife advocates worry that China’s recommended use of Tan Re Qing injections, which contain goat horn powder and extracts from several plants in addition to bear bile powder, will increase the trade in illegal wildlife products and justify animal abuse. “There’s a consistent preference among consumers for the wild product, which is often regarded as more powerful or ‘the real deal,’” White says. “So, having this legal market from captivity doesn’t reduce pressure on the wild populations—it actually just maintains demand that drives poaching.”

At bear bile farms in China and across Southeast Asia, the animals may be kept for decades in small cages. Bile is routinely extracted by inserting a catheter, syringe, or pipe into the gallbladder. All methods for extracting bile are invasive and “cause severe suffering, pain, and infection,” according to Animals Asia, a nonprofit dedicated to ending bear bile farming. Neglect and disease are common on these farms, and consumers risk ingesting bile from sick bears, which may be contaminated with blood, feces, pus, urine, and bacteria, according to Animals Asia.

Another traditional medicine on the National Health Commission’s approved list that could be in demand for use against COVID-19 is a pill called Angong Niuhuang Wan. The remedy, used to treat fever and various diseases, traditionally contains rhino horn, which is strictly banned from global trade. Under Chinese law, the pills must contain buffalo horn, White says, but some traders continue to tout pills containing rhino horn.

Promotion of Tan Re Qing injections and other wildlife-based treatments at a time when Beijing seems intent on shutting down the country’s trade in live wild animals “really speaks to the mixed messages coming out of China at the moment,” White says.

China’s National Health Commission did not respond to requests for comment.

Risks to human health

All wildlife farms pose health risks, regardless of whether the animals are being bred for meat or traditional medicine, White says. For example, in both cases, hundreds of wild animals often live crammed together, and people often interact with carcasses.

“Whether [wildlife is] being consumed as meat or as medicine, the risks are still there in how the animals are being slaughtered, gathered and stored, processed, consumed,” White says. If China is closing farms that produce meat from wild animals such as peacocks, porcupines, and boar because they pose a disease risk, White says, “why are they also not looking at farms—you know, bear farms, tiger farms? You have many of the same issues.” Besides, he adds, “the vast majority of traditional Chinese medicine doesn’t contain any wildlife parts. This doesn’t need to be a threat to wildlife.”

When it comes to COVID-19, what we need is clear, says the University of Minnesota’s Clifford Steer. “At the end of the day,” he says, “the world just has to develop a vaccine against this to protect people.”";China promotes bear bile as coronavirus treatment, alarming wildlife

Returning the devil to the mainland may not only help its threatened status but could help control invasive predators such as feral cats and foxes.

The idea of returning devils to the mainland has been raised before.

But now we’ve explored the idea from a palaeontological view. We looked at the fossil record of mainland devils, in a paper published online and in print soon in the journal Biological Conservation.

Gilbert Price , Author provided

The fossil record helps us better understand how the devils co-existed on mainland Australia with other wildlife. It also helps us see how these iconic animals may possibly interact with small and medium-sized animals if reintroduced to the mainland in the future.

Back in the wild

Ecologists have reintroduced several apex predators to environments where they were once driven to localised extinction. This has helped restore past ecosystems by providing a clearer ecological balance.

One of the best-known examples is the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park in the United States, to check the overgrazing and destruction of habitat by elk.

By reintroducing Tasmanian devils into mainland Australia, can we possibly help restore ecological systems that support devils along with small to medium-sized native mammals?

Native and exotic predators

Tasmanian devils and thylacines (Tasmanian tigers) were displaced across the mainland of Australia sometime after the dingo was introduced from southeast Asia at least 3,500 years ago.

But these iconic Australian predators were still able to survive in Tasmania. The island was created 10,000 years ago by rising sea levels, well before the arrival of dingoes on mainland Australia.

Dingoes have now been eradicated across much of mainland Australia, particularly within the seclusion zone of the dingo fence in the southeast of the continent. The 5,400km fence stretches eastwards across South Australia into New South Wales and to southeast Queensland.

Exotic predators such as foxes and cats now thrive across many parts of Australia, and have devastating impacts on small to medium-sized Australian mammals.

But until recently they have not been able to gain a foothold in Tasmania. Many ecologists believe the presence of the devil has prevented these other animals making their destructive mark on the ecology of Tasmania.

Sadly the situation is changing as a result of the deadly devil facial tumour disease, an infectious cancer that has destroyed many populations of Tasmanian devils. Estimates range up to 90% of some population groups now wiped out.

As a result, feral cats are now moving into former devil habitats and hunting native species on Tasmania.

A fossil window to the past

So what does the fossil record tell us about the past life of the Tasmanian devil in mainland Australia?

The Willandra Lakes World Heritage Area, in southeast Australia, provides an extraordinary archaeological and palaeoecological record of Ice Age Australia.

In the past, skeletal remains buried within the landscape were commonly fossilised. Evidence of small animals that dug burrows (such as burrowing bettongs) and the predators that pursued them in their burrows, are exceptionally well preserved.

Our excavations reveal how devils and other small-to-medium sized mammals and reptiles interacted over more than 20,000 years in this area. Even during the peak arid phase, known as the Last Glacial Maximum, it seems that devils and their prey successfully co-existed.

Toot Toot Design , Author provided

The fossil record shows that the range of habitats occupied by devils in the past was far more diverse than today, with populations being found across environments from the central arid core to the northern tropics.

This suggests that devils today should, theoretically, be able to reoccupy a similarly extensive range of habitats.

Toot Toot Design , Author provided

Better the devil you know

Some ecologists suggest dingoes should be reintroduced into Australian habitats in order to reduce the impact of cats and foxes on native mammals.

One problem is that dingoes also prey on livestock. This is the reason the dingo fence was constructed during the 1880s.

But devils are not active predators of cattle and sheep. So reintroducing a predator that has a much longer evolutionary history with other native mammals in this country would likely receive far less opposition from pastoralists.

A reintroduction of devils back to the mainland may be a new approach to consider for controlling the relentless, destructive march of exotic predators and restore crucial elements of Australia’s biodiversity.

It still needs to be demonstrated that devils can suppress the activities of cats and foxes on the mainland, as they seem to have done in Tasmania. Experiments with devils in a range of different settings would help to establish this.

The European Union helped pass a strict ban on selling African baby elephants to zoos, BBC News reported last week. Zimbabwe and the United States were among the nations that voted against the trade restrictions, which passed August 27. The vote supersedes zoos’ usual conservation efforts.

Baby elephant trading has long involved capturing baby African elephants in the wild, traumatically separating them from their families, and selling them to zoos worldwide. Photo by Theodore Mattas / Shutterstock

The near-total ban on exporting baby elephants from the wild and selling them to zoos worldwide was approved at the Geneva meeting of the organization called Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), according to the BBC. Part of the motivation for the ban was to curb the separation of baby elephants from their parents, which biologists say is traumatizing for animal families. Limited trading will still be allowed by nations such as Zimbabwe and Botswana, which have far higher elephant populations than other countries. Despite the ban’s focus on the roles that zoos play in the separation and trading of elephants, zoos and zoologists have taken active roles in wildlife conservation in other instances.

Conservation Example of Monk Seal

Besides running zoos, what do zoologists and accredited zoos do for our knowledge of wildlife? The newly extinct Caribbean monk seal gives us one example. It finds itself at the center of a 500-year-old mystery when compared to its cousins, the Hawaiian monk seal and the Mediterranean monk seal. Simply put, all three species don’t quite line up the way they should.

“All three species were [originally] placed in the same genus, Monachus,” said Dr. Donald E. Moore, III, director of the Oregon Zoo and senior science advisor at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. “Although the last, living Caribbean monk seal was spotted in 1952, Smithsonian’s scientists were able to extract DNA samples from century-old sealskins in the museum collections.”

Then, by collaborating with scientists in New York and Germany, the Smithsonian scientists compared the Caribbean monk seal DNA with the DNA of their Mediterranean and Hawaiian counterparts.

“It turns out the Hawaiian and Caribbean species are much more similar to each other on a genetic level than they are to the Mediterranean species,” Dr. Moore said. “Thus, zoologists have now placed them on their own branch of the tree of life in a separate genus, Neomonachus, or the new monk seals. Because of the amount of variation in their genes, zoologists were also able to estimate that the Hawaiian and Caribbean species were separated into two distinct populations about three to four million years ago—right around the time geologists estimate that the Isthmus of Panama closed the connection between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.”

Zoos and Genetic Diversity

Dr. Moore also explained how zoos aim to help species maintain their genetic diversity, a topic which came into discussion during last week’s CITES decision on baby African elephants.

“In the case of the cheetah, Smithsonian reproductive biologists manage a Species Survival Plan for North America’s Association of Zoos and Aquariums,” he said. “We keep records of the age and sex distribution of the population, the transfers of cheetahs between facilities, and the breeding of those cheetahs. We evaluate their genetic health and model breeding outcomes with computers, in the hope of using this modern ‘computer dating’ to enhance the genetic makeup of cheetahs both in captivity and in the wild.”

 Ground Parrot;Pezoporus wallicus;Australia;Least Concern;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Psittaciformes;Psittacidae;Pezoporus;wallicus;I;Australia;;"SINGAPORE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian animals living in specific habitats, such as mountain lizards, leaf-tailed geckos and pear-shaped frogs, are battling the threat of extinction after fierce bushfires razed large areas of their homes, a new Reuters analysis shows.

Fire has destroyed more than two-thirds of a northeastern zone sprawling over 12 sq km (5 sq miles) where a type of lizard, the Mount Surprise Litter-skink, lives, the analysis of known habitats and satellite-detected fire activity shows.

“The Mount Surprise Litter-skink is one of a number of species that has very limited distribution. That can mean there’s a huge risk of extinction,” said conservation biologist David Lindenmayer.

“When species distributions are so limited, there’s a really high risk that just a single event could knock them down,” added Lindenmayer, an academic at Australian National University.

The huge wildfires have razed more than 11.2 million hectares (27.7 million acres), an area equivalent to half the United Kingdom, and killed 29 people since flaring last year in the southern hemisphere spring.

Officials estimate the fires have ravaged more than 80% of the unique ecosystems of at least 49 animal and plant species already listed as ‘threatened’.

Reuters analysis shows species at risk also include the Kate’s leaf-tailed gecko and the tiny Pugh’s frog, after fires ravaged more than half of their home areas.

The government has called the blazes an ecological disaster, and up to a billion animals, including livestock and domestic pets, are estimated either to have died in them or be at risk after the destruction of food sources and shelter.

Even species with much larger habitat ranges, such as the rarely-seen eastern ground parrot, face challenges as the ground-dwelling bird lives in coastal and sub-coastal shrubland that is prone to catching fire, environmental officials say.

Even many animals that survive the fires, such as the long-footed potoroo, a rat-kangaroo that lives in southeastern forests, will face threats, said Brendan Wintle, a specialist in conservation ecology at the University of Melbourne.

“They are now also very threatened because of wild foxes, cats and wild dogs,” he said. “These predators are very good at targeting areas that have been burned or near burned and they know the animals have left their shelter.”

While bushfires are common in Australia, authorities say the current scale of destruction is unprecedented, fueled by a prolonged drought and record high temperatures that have left eastern regions tinder-dry.

The island continent is home to some of the world’s most interesting and diverse animals, such as the platypus and koala, which have been devastated by fires.

An estimated 30% of koala habitat, comprised of eucalypt woodlands, which the animals use both for food and shelter, may have been lost in the state of New South Wales, said Sally Box, the commissioner for threatened species.

The koalas’ heavy fur and tendency to climb higher when threatened are severe disadvantages in fast-moving bushfires.

Reuters calculates that more than 47,000 sq km (18,147 sq miles) of koala habitat has been affected by fire.";Australian bushfires threaten to drive tiny animal communities extinct;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiELNmX-hGSXzIF9-DrT0x8ZYqFQgEKg0IACoGCAowt6AMMLAmMJSCDg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20200122&t=2&i=1479568059&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEG0K1C2;2020-01-22;[{'sent': 'SINGAPORE/SYDNEY (Reuters) -', 'ents': {'GPE': ['SINGAPORE'], 'ORG': ['Reuters']}}, {'sent': 'Australian animals living in specific habitats, such as mountain lizards, leaf-tailed geckos and pear-shaped frogs, are battling the threat of extinction after fierce bushfires razed large areas of their homes, a new Reuters analysis shows.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Reuters']}}, {'sent': 'A burning gum tree is felled to stop it from falling on a car in Corbago, as bushfires continue in New South Wales, Australia January 5, 2020.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Corbago', 'Australia', 'New South Wales']}}, {'sent': 'REUTERS/Tracey Nearmy/File Photo\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['REUTERS/']}}, {'sent': 'Fire has destroyed more than two-thirds of a northeastern zone sprawling over 12 sq km (5 sq miles) where a type of lizard, the Mount Surprise Litter-skink, lives, the analysis of known habitats and satellite-detected fire activity shows.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['more than two-thirds'], 'QUANTITY': ['12 sq km', '5 sq miles'], 'GPE': ['the Mount Surprise Litter-skink']}}, {'sent': 'That can mean there’s a huge risk of extinction,” said conservation biologist David Lindenmayer.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['David Lindenmayer']}}, {'sent': '“When species distributions are so limited, there’s a really high risk that just a single event could knock them down,” added Lindenmayer, an academic at Australian National University.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Lindenmayer'], 'ORG': ['Australian National University']}}, {'sent': 'The huge wildfires have razed more than 11.2 million hectares (27.7 million acres), an area equivalent to half the United Kingdom, and killed 29 people since flaring last year in the southern hemisphere spring.\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['more than 11.2 million hectares', '27.7 million acres'], 'CARDINAL': ['29', 'half'], 'GPE': ['the United Kingdom']}}, {'sent': 'Officials estimate the fires have ravaged more than 80% of the unique ecosystems of at least 49 animal and plant species already listed as ‘threatened’.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['at least 49']}}, {'sent': 'Reuters analysis shows species at risk also include the Kate’s leaf-tailed gecko and the tiny Pugh’s', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Reuters'], 'PERSON': ['Kate']}}, {'sent': 'frog, after fires ravaged more than half of their home areas.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['more than half']}}, {'sent': 'Even many animals that survive the fires, such as the long-footed potoroo, a rat-kangaroo that lives in southeastern forests, will face threats, said Brendan Wintle, a specialist in conservation ecology at the University of Melbourne.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Brendan Wintle'], 'ORG': ['the University of Melbourne']}}, {'sent': 'While bushfires are common in Australia, authorities say the current scale of destruction is unprecedented, fueled by a prolonged drought and record high temperatures that have left eastern regions tinder-dry.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Australia']}}, {'sent': 'The island continent is home to some of the world’s most interesting and diverse animals, such as the platypus and koala, which have been devastated by fires.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['koala']}}, {'sent': 'An estimated 30% of koala habitat, comprised of eucalypt woodlands, which the animals use both for food and shelter, may have been lost in the state of New South Wales, said Sally Box, the commissioner for threatened species.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['New South Wales', 'koala habitat'], 'PERSON': ['Sally Box']}}, {'sent': 'Reuters calculates that more than 47,000 sq km (18,147 sq miles) of koala habitat has been affected by fire.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Reuters'], 'MONEY': ['more than 47,000 sq km'], 'QUANTITY': ['18,147 sq miles'], 'GPE': ['koala habitat']}}];Negative
Short-necked turtle;Pseudemydura umbrina;Australia;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Reptilia;Testudines;Chelidae;Pseudemydura;umbrina;I;Australia;;"Ninety percent of the world’s coastal freshwater turtle species are expected to be affected by sea level rise by 2100, according to a study from the University of California, Davis.

The study, published in Early View online today in the journal Biological Reviews, is the first comprehensive global assessment of freshwater turtles that frequent brackish, or slightly salty, waters. The study may help guide conservation strategies for turtles.

“About 30 percent of coastal freshwater species have been found or reported in a slightly saltwater environment,” said lead author Mickey Agha, a UC Davis graduate student in associate professor Brian Todd’s lab in the Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology. “But they tend to live within a low-level range of salinity. If sea level rise increases salinity, we don’t yet know if they’ll be able to adapt or shift their range.”

From Suisun Marsh to the world

Of the world’s 356 turtle species, only about seven are sea turtles, 60 are terrestrial tortoises, and the rest live in freshwater environments, such as lakes, ponds and streams. Of those, about 70 percent live near coastlines, which are expected to experience rising sea levels. Some freshwater turtles lose body mass and can die when exposed to high levels of salty water, while others can tolerate a broader range of salinity.

UC Davis wildlife biologists have been studying western pond turtles in the semi-salty waters of Suisun Marsh in Northern California. While abundant in the marsh, this species is in decline in many other parts of the state. The researchers observed that the turtles could face a triple threat of drought, water diversions and increased sea level rise, all of which can result in saltier habitats for them. It prompted the researchers to wonder not only how the western pond turtle would cope with such changes, but also how freshwater turtles around the world are expected to fare under the projected sea level rise of 3 feet by 2100.

When seawater meets freshwater

In their assessment, the study’s authors used a warming scenario projected for 2100 to overlay estimates of sea level rise on georeferenced maps of coastal turtle species worldwide.

The results indicated that turtles most at risk from sea level rise live in Oceania — Southeast Asia, Australia and New Guinea — and southeastern North America. In those regions, about 15 species may lose more than 10 percent of their present range.

Of the species most affected, half live on the island of New Guinea, where many species are predicted to see an average of 21 percent of their range flooded by a 3-foot rise in sea level.

Additionally, the study estimates that sea level rise will affect:

65 percent of the range of Australia’s snake-necked turtle

About 20 percent of the range of the pig-nosed turtle, native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea

30 percent of the range of the diamondback terrapin, which lives in the eastern and southern U.S., as well as the New Guinea giant softshell turtle and Brazilian slider turtle

Harmless, inoffensive, long-lived

Turtles are arguably one of the more beloved reptiles on the planet.

“They’re harmless, they’re friendly, they live a long time,” said senior author Todd. “They’re about as inoffensive as you can get for an animal, and they’ve existed for so long.”

Western pond turtles, for example, can survive more than 50 years in the wild. And turtle species have been on Earth for tens of millions of years.

More research is needed to see how freshwater turtles can adapt and adjust to these changing environments, but what researchers see now raises concerns.

“If we’ve underestimated the impact of sea level rise along coastlines, we don’t yet know whether these turtles can adapt or shift fast enough to move with the changing salinity, or whether that part of its range will be gone forever,” Agha said.

Todd added: “This is a species that is slow to evolve. If we rely on natural selection to sustain them, they will likely disappear.""

Turtles represent one of the world’s most-imperiled order of reptiles. This study points to one more in the rogue’s gallery of obstacles they face, said co-author Joshua Ennen, a biologist with the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute.

“Roughly half of the world’s turtle and tortoise species are currently threatened with extinction,” Ennen said. “Our research sheds light on yet another factor related to climate change that could threaten this unique group of vertebrates.”

Additional co-authors include Joshua Ennen and Sarah Sweat from the Tennessee Aquarium Conservation Institute, Deborah Bower of James Cook University in Australia, and A. Justin Nowakowski from UC Davis.

 Campbell Island Teal;Anas nesiotis;New Zealand;EN;2020-06-18;Animalia;Aves;Anseriformes;Anatidae;Anas;nesiotis;I;New Zealand;;"Campbell Island, the most southerly of New Zealand's subantarctic islands, lies about 700km south of Bluff. Successful rat eradication here has inspired similar efforts on islands around the world.

The Department of Conservation is aiming to remove mice from Antipodes Island this winter. SARAH-JANE O'CONNOR looks back at the eradication that paved the way 15 years ago.

The rats probably arrived on Campbell Island in 1828, when the sealing brig Perseverance was shipwrecked that October.

DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION A juvenile Campbell Island snipe. The sub-species was unknown to science until 1997. It recolonised Campbell Island after rats were eradicated in 2001.

By 1840, when the first naturalists arrived on the far-flung subantarctic island, the damage had already been done. Those aboard James Clark Ross's Erebus and Terror expedition had just been to the Auckland Islands and noticed Campbell was missing many of the land birds of the Aucklands.

They were right: there was a parakeet already extinct; a flightless duck banished to tiny islands offshore; a snipe similarly banished, not to be ""discovered"" by scientists until 1997.

In 2001, the Department of Conservation (DOC) tackled a job many thought was impossible: they rid Campbell Island of the norway rats that had pillaged the island for more than 150 years.

DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION Campbell Island teal, once probably rarer than kakapo, were reintroduced to Campbell Island after the 2001 rat eradication.

Pete McClelland was the project manager for the operation, which at the time was the biggest island eradication ever attempted.

""It was whole new ground,"" McClelland said. ""The largest eradication before had been Kapiti [Island] at about 2500 hectares and then suddenly we were drumming it up to 11,000 ha and also instead of operating 10km off the coast we were 700km off the coast.""

Until that point, island eradications using brodifacoum - an anticoagulant poison commonly sold in stores as Pestoff or Talon - used helicopters to make two bait drops, one of 8kg per hectare and the other of 4kg per ha. But the size of Campbell Island and the likely weather conditions in the region known as the Furious Fifties meant it could have taken six months to manage two bait applications.

So methods were tweaked and in the winter of 2001, after a successful test run, helicopters were flown down to distribute a single bait drop, at 6kg per ha Five years later, when monitoring had found no trace of rats, the eradication was declared a success.

Fifteen years on from the operation, some of the benefits from rat removal are confounded by sheep being taken off the island, starting in 1970 (they were a remnant of a failed attempt at farming). But McClelland said the regrowth in vegetation was remarkable compared to when he first visited Campbell Island in the late 1980s.

More directly, weta numbers increased, pipits and snipe recolonised from smaller rat-free islands nearby, grey-backed storm petrels and white-chinned petrels were recorded breeding for the first time after the rats were gone. By 2004, DOC was confident enough to reintroduce the Campbell Island teal, a flightless duck that had been taken from a nearby rat-free island and bred in captivity until the eradication had been completed.

DOC island eradication advisory group chairman Keith Broome said, for a species like the teal, the eradication ""sort of turned back the clock for them to the time before rats arrived on the island"".

""More or less they've come off the endangered species list as a consequence and, apart from making sure predators don't get back on Campbell, there's no further kind of action required, there's no further conservation spending on it.""

It was while teams were searching for more teal that they accidentally stumbled across the Campbell Island snipe on nearby Jacquemart Island. Though the 20ha island is only 1km away from Campbell Island, its steep cliffs mean hardly anyone has visited and then only briefly by helicopter.

Te Papa vertebrate curator Colin Miskelly helped describe and name the new snipe subspecies, which recolonised Campbell Island after the eradication without human intervention.

Miskelly said little was known about keeping snipe in captivity and there were likely too few birds to move from Jacquemart Island.

""We were fretting that if we caught some to move them, you're potentially wiping out the only natural population in the process and taking a gamble on whether they'd survive and breed where you're going to let them go. So it was a great relief when they did it themselves.""

McClelland said clearing Campbell Island of rats had a huge impact on other international eradication efforts.

""That opened up a whole new spectrum of other islands that could be considered and could be done. The Australians would never have done Macquarie [Island] if it hadn't been for Campbell, the Brits would never have tried South Georgia, the Yanks would not have done the Aleutians, they were all considered too hard to do until Campbell was successful.

""It started a new wave of eradications.""

With DOC preparing for an operation on Antipodes Island this winter in the hope of eradicating mice, McClelland said some people still struggled to believe an island could be freed of introduced mammals.

""The public still doesn't believe that you can get every rat off an island. Around your house you've always got mice coming in or rats coming in and you never get on top of them.

""There's something in the psyche that a lot of people just cannot understand how you can eradicate. They just don't believe that you can get something as small as rats, let alone mice, off an area of that size.

""So it's always great to prove them wrong.""";Plague of mice on subantarctic Antipodes Island may be living on borrowed time;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L3NjaWVuY2UvNzg3MDU4MTIvcGxhZ3VlLW9mLW1pY2Utb24tc3ViYW50YXJjdGljLWFudGlwb2Rlcy1pc2xhbmQtbWF5LWJlLWxpdmluZy1vbi1ib3Jyb3dlZC10aW1l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/a/w/y/z/6/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1auxsk.png/1460673179302.jpg;2016-04-14;"[{'sent': ""Campbell Island, the most southerly of New Zealand's subantarctic islands, lies about 700km south of Bluff."", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Bluff', 'Campbell Island', ""New Zealand's""], 'QUANTITY': ['about 700km']}}, {'sent': 'The Department of Conservation is aiming to remove mice from Antipodes Island this winter.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Department of Conservation'], 'GPE': ['Antipodes Island']}}, {'sent': 'DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION A juvenile Campbell Island snipe.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Campbell Island']}}, {'sent': 'It recolonised Campbell Island after rats were eradicated in 2001.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Campbell Island']}}, {'sent': ""Those aboard James Clark Ross's Erebus and Terror expedition had just been to the Auckland Islands and noticed Campbell was missing many of the land birds of the Aucklands.\n\n"", 'ents': {'PERSON': [""James Clark Ross's""], 'ORG': ['Aucklands', 'Erebus', 'Campbell'], 'GPE': ['the Auckland Islands']}}, {'sent': 'In 2001, the Department of Conservation (DOC) tackled a job many thought was impossible: they rid Campbell Island of the norway rats that had pillaged the island for more than 150 years.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Department of Conservation', 'DOC'], 'GPE': ['Campbell Island']}}, {'sent': 'DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION Campbell Island teal, once probably rarer than kakapo, were reintroduced to Campbell Island after the 2001 rat eradication.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Campbell Island']}}, {'sent': 'Pete McClelland was the project manager for the operation, which at the time was the biggest island eradication ever attempted.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Pete McClelland']}}, {'sent': '""It was whole new ground,"" McClelland said.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['McClelland']}}, {'sent': '""The largest eradication before had been Kapiti [Island] at about 2500 hectares and then suddenly we were drumming it up to 11,000 ha and also instead of operating 10km off the coast we were 700km off the coast.""\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Kapiti'], 'QUANTITY': ['10km', '700km', 'about 2500 hectares'], 'CARDINAL': ['11,000']}}, {'sent': 'Until that point, island eradications using brodifacoum -

Philippine Pangolin;Manis culionensis;Philippines;CR;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Pholidota;Manidae;Manis;culionensis;I;Philippines;;"THE pangolin, known as anteater, has recently been included on the list of animals that are threatened with extinction under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

CITES’s Appendix I lists species that are the most endangered among its listed animals and plants. They are threatened with extinction and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of these species, except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for instance, for scientific research.

The listing came following the alarming decrease in the global population of the unique species of mammal that feed on insects, particularly ants, with the hope that global effort to prevent the illegal-wildlife trade would also follow.

Termites are beneficial to forest ecosystems as they feed on dead plant materials, wood, leaf litter, soil or even animal dung.

Recycling of wood and plant matter makes termites ecologically important, as the process help improve soil nutrient, boosting plant in the forest.

Home invaders

At home, however, some species of termites or white ants are horrible pests. They could cause great damage to home structures. Uncontrolled, they could literally bring the house down and cost millions worth of real-property investment.

Who would chose to buy a home invaded by termites, anyway?

In the Philippines homeowners spend huge amount of money hiring professionals just to extinguish the sneaky termites.

Termites leave a thin layer of the wood they feed on for their protection. By the time they are discovered, they have already caused damage that would cost homeowners a fortune repairing the structural integrity of their house.

Termite controller

In Palawan, the only place in the Philippines where pangolins thrive, termite control is not much of a problem.

However, the rampant illegal-wildlife trade targeting unique species of plants and animals, including pangolins, is becoming a serious problem, officials of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said.Director Theresa Mundita S. Lim of DENR’s Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) said maintaining a healthy population of pangolins help control the population of termites.

While there are other animals that eat or prey on termites, pangolins are the pest’s most notorious predator.

Big appetite for ants

Besides termites, pangolins have a big appetite for ants. A single adult pangolin can eat up to 200,000 ants in one meal, or more than 70 million in a year.

“Without pangolins, there is a big chance the termite population would grow and spread throughout the province, increasing the risk of transfer to other areas, where they can also cause trouble,” Lim said.

Josie de Leon, chief of the BMB’s wildlife unit, said termites are pangolins favorite meal.

“There are other animals that feed on termites, but only pangolins can effectively control their population,” she said.

Pangolins climb trees to feed on termites that establish colonies on high trees.

While termites feed mostly on dead wood, it could also cause severe damage to trees with weak resistance or protect against attacking white ants.

The unchecked population of termite compromise ecological balance, she said.

Lim urges real-estate and -property developers to invest in protecting and conserving pangolins and their habitats to prevent what could be a major problem caused by home invasion of termites once pangolins become extinct.

“Real-property developers should invest in biodiversity conservation because a healthy ecosystem helps protect their investment from damage caused by termites,” she said.

Most hunted

The pangolin is one of the world’s most illegally traded wildlife. Based on the estimate of the DENR’s BMB, almost a thousand Palawan pangolins were illegally traded from 2000 to 2013.

China is known to be the destination of pangolins being smuggled out of the country—whether dead or alive—for their alleged medicinal value and aphrodisiac properties.

According to Lim, hunters of pangolins are after their meat, skin and internal organs.

In Palawan wildlife law enforcers reported that even indigenous people are into hunting these defenceless anteaters.

“They know how to hunt them and they know where to find them. They catch them and sell them to unscrupulous wildlife traders,” Lim said.

Global protection

Its inclusion on CITES list of endangered species highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy population in the wild, along with its ecological importance in helping regulate insect population and ensure survival of seedlings.

The upgrading of the pangolin to CITES Appendix I came with stricter penalties for those involved in the illegal trade and killing of the harmless mammal.

Environment Secretary Regina Paz L. Lopez recently warned against catching, trading or killing anteaters as mandated by CITES.

Adopted by over 180 countries, CITES is an international agreement that aims to ensure the survival of wild plants and animals. Appendix I lists plants and animals that are threatened with extinction, thus, trading them internationally for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited.

Of the eight pangolin species worldwide, only one can be found in the Philippines. Locally known as balintong, the Manis culionensis is endemic to Palawan province.

Palawan’s anteater is critically endangered, with its numbers highly threatened by its low fecundity or number of offspring produced per year, loss of habitat, and illegal trade of its scales and meat.

Prior to its inclusion in Appendix I, the pangolin was listed in Appendix II, which provides a modest level of protection as it requires exporting countries to ensure that any traded pangolin specimens have been legally obtained and that their export will not be detrimental to the species’ survival.

“Further endangering the pangolin is a crime that threatens our biodiversity and the fragility of our ecosystems. The DENR will not hesitate to apply the full extent of the law to anyone caught catching, killing or selling pangolin,” Lopez warned.

Republic Act 9147, or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, prescribes various penalties for illegal acts toward threatened species.

Stricter penalty

Under the law, illegal transport of pangolin may merit imprisonment of up to one year and a fine of up to P100,000. A jail term of up to four years and a fine of P300,000 await those who will be found guilty of trading pangolin.

The killing of pangolin carries a jail term of up to 12 years and a fine of up to P1 million.

The ban on the international trade of pangolins was proposed and approved by the Philippines and the United States during the World Wildlife Conference of the CITES Conference of Parties in Johannesburg, South Africa, held from September 24 to October 5.

With the illegal trade compounded by habitat loss and the species’ low rate of reproduction, officials of the DENR believe that it would be impossible for pangolin population to recover, given current rates of catch.

The inclusion of the Philippine pangolin in Appendix I of CITES would help prevent the further decline of its population in the wild and ensure their continued performance as a regulator of insect populations.";Pangolin, termite-control ‘specialist’;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NtaXJyb3IuY29tLnBoLzIwMTYvMTAvMjIvcGFuZ29saW4tdGVybWl0ZS1jb250cm9sLXNwZWNpYWxpc3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://businessmirror.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bio01-102316.jpg;2016-10-22;[{'sent': 'THE pangolin, known as anteater, has recently been included on the list of animals that are threatened with extinction under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['CITES', 'Appendix'], 'PERSON': ['Flora']}}, {'sent': 'CITES’s', 'ents': {'ORG': ['CITES']}}, {'sent': 'Appendix', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Appendix']}}, {'sent': 'They are threatened with extinction and CITES prohibits international trade in specimens of these species, except when the purpose of the import is not commercial, for instance, for scientific research.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['CITES']}}, {'sent': 'Uncontrolled, they could literally bring the house down and cost millions worth of real-property investment.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['millions']}}, {'sent': 'In the Philippines homeowners spend huge amount of money hiring professionals just to extinguish the sneaky termites.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Philippines']}}, {'sent': 'In Palawan, the only place in the Philippines where pangolins thrive, termite control is not much of a problem.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Palawan', 'Philippines']}}, {'sent': 'However, the rampant illegal-wildlife trade targeting unique species of plants and animals, including pangolins, is becoming a serious problem, officials of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR']}}, {'sent': 'Director Theresa Mundita S.
