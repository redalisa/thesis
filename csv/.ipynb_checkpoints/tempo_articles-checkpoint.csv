Javan Gibbon~Hylobates moloch~Indonesia~Endangered~2020-06-18~14~Animalia~Mammalia~Primates~Hylobatidae~Hylobates~moloch~I~Indonesia~~0~"TEMPO.CO, Nairobi - The world`s last male northern white rhino has died, the Kenyan conservancy taking care of it said, leaving only two females of its subspecies alive in the world although scientists still hope they can save it from extinction. Ol Pejeta Conservancy said in a statement it had made the decision with wildlife officials and his previous carers to euthanize on Monday the 45-year-old rhino, named Sudan, due to the rapid deterioration in his condition.

Sudan was being treated for age-related complications that had affected his muscles and bones and also gave him extensive skin wounds.

The rhino had spent two weeks in late February and early March lying in his pen due to discomfort from a deep wound on his right hind leg.

""His condition worsened significantly in the last 24 hours; he was unable to stand up and was suffering a great deal,"" Ol Pejeta said. ""The veterinary team from theDverKralove Zoo, Ol Pejeta and Kenya Wildlife Service made the decision to euthanize him.""

Sudan had previously lived at theDverKralove Zoo in the Czech Republic before being transported to Ol Pejeta Conservancy, about 250 km (155 miles) north of Nairobi, where he lived with the last two females of the same species, 27-year-old Najin and 17-year-old Fatu.

After all attempts at getting him to mate naturally failed, conservationists last year put Sudan on dating app Tinder, hoping to raise enough money to pay for a $9 million fertility treatment.

Ol Pejeta said that they had collected Sudan's genetic material on Monday that could be used in future to attempt reproduction of northern white rhinos.

It said scientists were also seeking ways to do in vitro fertilization.

""The only hope for the preservation of this subspecies now lies in developing in vitro fertilization techniques using eggs from the two remaining females, stored northern white rhino semen from males and surrogate southern white rhino females,"" it said

While there are thousands of southern white rhinos still roaming the plains of sub-Saharan Africa, decades of rampant poaching have drastically cut numbers of northern whites.

Poachers can sell northern white rhino horns for $50,000 per kilo, making them more valuable than gold.

Kenya had 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, falling to 400 in the 1990s. It now has 650, almost all of which are black rhinos.

The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society said Wednesday that its researchers, along with Fisheries Administration employees and local residents, had found six eggs of the Siamese Crocodile in the southern province of Koh Kong as they were exploring for tracks, signs, and dung of the reptile.

The group says the crocodile, with an estimated global population of around 410, is found only in Cambodia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, with the greatest number in Cambodia.

It said the finders moved the crocodile eggs to a safe place where they can also be monitored. Poachers are a threat to the crocodiles' survival.

The province is endowed with several natural and marine tourist attractions with many white sandy beaches, pristine waterfalls, lush nature preserves, and much more for both local and international tourists to enjoy.

Among many districts in the province, East Lampung is a rich, beautiful and interesting area with friendly people and a lot of tourist attractions.

Attempting to attract even more tourists, the district government, through the local Culture and Tourism Office, is making every effort to develop numerous natural, marine and cultural tourist attractions.

The many tourist attractions in East Lampung include the Way Kambas National Park, Pugung Raharjo Archaeological Park, Kerang Mas beach, Lake Kemuning, Lake Beringin, agro tourism and cultural tourism.

East Lampung Culture and Tourism Office Chief Mastur remarked that among these tourist attractions, Kerang Mas beach in Labuhan Maringgai is now being developed.

Once this beach development is completed, Lake Kemuning and Lake Beringin will also be developed in stages in an effort to attract 250 thousand tourists to East Lampung in 2016.

Lampung province has 64 waterfalls, numerous small, beautiful islands, and seven leading tourist areas where supporting infrastructure facilities are being improved.

The seven leading tourist areas are the Waikambas National Park; South Bukit Barisan National Park; Kiluan Bay; Tanjung Setia and Krui Marine Tourism; Siger Tower; Mount Anak Krakatau and Sebesi Island; and Bandarlampung Tourism Area.

The Elephant Rehabilitation Center in Way Kambas National Park, where wild, rampaging elephants are domesticated and taught useful skills, also offers a special attraction for visitors.

The several bird-watching locations boast of the presence of the rare white-winged wood duck. The Way Kambas National Park is home to critically endangered species, such as Sumatran tigers, Sumatran elephants and Sumatran rhinoceroses.

With swamp forest, lowland rainforest, mangrove forest and dry beach forest, along with expanses of grasslands, this national park is an ideal habitat for thousands of different species and offers several opportunities for visitors to experience some of Indonesias most diverse wildlife.

Hence, Way Kambas is being developed into a national and international tourist destination.

The Way Kambas National Park is an icon of the East Lampung District and is well known, both in the country and abroad.

The Great Hall of the Way Kambas National Park is also drafting a strategy to use trained domesticated elephants in the Elephant Conservation Center as a tourist attraction.

However, the parks management is waiting for the governments guidelines on the use of the Elephant Conservation Center as a tourist destination.

The management is still awaiting an approval from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry on using elephants to entertain visitors.

The Way Kambas National Park Great Hall is currently formulating a plan to develop an ecotourism village as a secondary destination for visitors.

According to Lampung Deputy Governor Bachtiar Basri, the development of the tourism sector in the province is directed at expanding ecosystem-based marine tourism and preserving nature.

The deputy governor emphasized that roads and transportation facilities, electricity, and security arrangements must be improved, so tourists visiting these spots can enjoy their stay and feel at home.

Lampung is well-known across the world for its Krakatau island volcano, one of the most intriguing sites globally; and for its agricultural commodities, such as pepper and coffee.

Given its central location, the Krakatau islands are accessible both from Jakarta through the province of Banten, and from Bandarlampung, the capital of Lampung.

The Krakatau islands comprise three small and scenic islands: Rakata, Panjang and Serdang.

Shaped in different ways by the impact and eruption of the Krakatau volcano eons ago, the beaches of Merak Belantung, Pasir Putih, and a tourist resort near the Lalaan waterfall, besides Mount Rajabasa, should also be on every visitors travel itinerary.

In addition, numerous tourist spots in Lampung Barat district are being readied to cater to as many local and foreign tourists as possible this year.

The Lampung Barat district government has always welcomed tourists, but this year, it has made additional efforts to attract even more domestic and foreign travelers.

In a bid to make vacationers feel at home, several tourist spots in Lampung Barat have hired additional workers to render optimum services, to offer a sense of comfort, and to ensure the security of visitors.

The tourist attractions in Lampung Barat also include the Tanjung Setia Beach in the Pesisir Selatan Sub-district. It offers natural panoramic views and challenging waves that are ideal for surfing.

The cool and crystal clear waters of Tanjung Setia also draw foreign holidaymakers.

Besides Tanjung Setia, Lampung Barat also has other tourist spots worth exploring, such as the Labuhan Jakung Beach, Pulau Pisang, Lake Ranau, the Way Besai rafting resort, and the Sekura Cakak Buah cultural festival.

In addition, the district offers white water rafting for both domestic and foreign tourists.

Lampung Barat has a river that offers opportunities for rafting, and therefore, it is ideal for both domestic and foreign tourists, who love water sports.

The swirling currents in the river hold special attraction for tourists, who want to test their courage by going surfing.

“[The location] was decided through experts’ consideration,” Bambang said.

The Javan rhinoceros is one out of five rare species in the world and is already considered as a critically endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Currently, the one and only habitat of the species is at the Ujung Kulon national park.

“Experts predict that there are only 67 rhinos left,” Bambang explained.

Based on previous data, there were only 60 Javan rhinos. It is predicted that the arrival of seven rhinos was caused by inbreeding.

The 67 number is considered as overcapacity, therefore, a transfer of the species is urgently needed, Bambang said. The ministry is currently preparing the process, starting from introducing the transfer plan earlier to the local residents that live in the vicinity of Cikepuh wildlife reserve considering that encroachment often takes place there.

Both species are being kept in conservations in West Java and Sumatra, but they are still facing a number of problems in their habitat.

Data from the Environment and Forestry Ministry shows there are only 63 Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) left. Meanwhile, the Sumatran rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) population is estimated to be less than a hundred.

The Sumatran rhinos are said to be living in worse conditions compare to their cousins in the Ujung Kulon National Park, Banten. Despite having a larger population, Sumatran rhinos are scattered in smaller subpopulations.

""The growth opportunity for Sumatran rhinos is relatively lower than the Javan rhinoceros,"" said Yuyun Kurniawan, project coordinator of the Ujung Kulon World Wildlife Fund Indonesia Program, said in a press release on September 22, which is the World Rhino Day.

According to Yuyun, proactive measures are needed to save the species from extinction.

""Saving the Sumatran rhino, which are becoming increasingly critical, requires species-based conservation approaches, like what was done to the Javan rhinoceros,"" he said.

The Javan rhino population managed to increase because of that effort. According to the WWF, in 1970 there were only 47 Javan rhinos. A decade later, the population grew to 51. Two years ago, the population rose to 57, and now there are 63 of them.

However, the Javan rhinoceros are now facing the problem of limited habitat to accommodate population growth. Another problem is in Ujung Kulon's fast-growing langkap trees (Arenga obsitulia), an invasive plant that inhibits the growth of forage plants for the Javan rhinos to eat.

The Indonesian government targets to boost the population of 25 protected species by 10 percent, including Javan and Sumatran rhinos, from 2015-2019. For the Javan rhinos, the target is almost achieved.

Sadly for the Sumatran rhinos, what happens is the opposite. The population has shrunk by 50 percent in the last ten years. In Kerinci Seblat, which is one of the offices of the population, not a single Sumatran rhino has been found since 2008.

Javan Gibbon~Hylobates moloch~Indonesia~Endangered~2020-06-18~14~Animalia~Mammalia~Primates~Hylobatidae~Hylobates~moloch~I~Indonesia~~0~"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - A Javan Leopard (Panthera pardus melas) was visually spotted in Cikepuh conservation park located in Sukabumi, West Java. Their activities at the park were captured by a number of the camera traps installed throughout the conservation park.

The Javan leopard was previously thought to have been locally extinct caused by poaching and encroachment activities in the past. The earliest series of destruction experienced by the conservation happened throughout the 1998-2001 period.

Head of the West Java Natural Resources Conservation Agency (BBKSDA), Sustyo Iriyono, explained that this encounter was made possible by the observation conducted by their joint operation together with the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (KLHK) throughout July-August 2016.

The observation was initiated by information provided by researchers from universities, local residents, and International Animal Rescue’s primate survey results, that discovered traces left by the Javan leopards in the area. The traces were in a form of scratch marks, feces, and footsteps.

Camera traps were placed at the locations that are considered to be the leopard’s trail. The 28-day observation captured seven video frames that show the leopards’ activities at the Cikepuh park. Based on the video, there are four leopards living in the area, namely three leopards of yellow spots species and one leopard of black spots species.

It is estimated that 12 leopards are currently living in the area, although further observation would be needed to determine the exact number of leopards and their sex ratio.

KLHK will also prepare programs, such as leopard inventory, conflict mitigation, forest fire control, development of the core zone, the reintroduction of other wildlife species, and restoration of wildlife habitat.
