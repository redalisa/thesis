That’s the good news.

The not-so-good news, the report concludes, is that massive infrastructure projects such as railways and high-speed road corridors, as well as industrial, port and mining activities, are beginning to affect the only habitat of the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) and are a major cause of concern for their future.

“During the last five decades (1965–2015), the approach for the Asiatic lion’s conservation is one of the best efforts in the world. Unlike other super predators, the number of lions has increased fourfold and (that of) wild ungulates by over thirteen-fold in the Gir forest,"" said the analysis authored by H.S. Singh.

“Expansion and consolidation of the Gir protected area, habitat of the Asiatic lion, and response of prey and predator to the management and dispersion trend of lions outside the Gir forests are interesting and noteworthy. The distribution range of lions has also expanded to a large landscape in four districts in the state,"" the report said.

In May 2015, the Gujarat government released its latest lion census figures, which said Gir’s Asiatic lion population had grown around 27%, from 411 in 2010 to 523 in 2015.

Asiatic lions, found only in Gujarat, have been classified as an endangered species.

The study explained that the Gir wildlife sanctuary, the first protected area (PA) in Gujarat, was established in 1965 to conserve the Asiatic lion. Subsequently, the core area of the sanctuary was declared a national park, while the sanctuary was expanded to cover peripheral forests. The adjoining area, an integral part of the Gir forest in Amreli district, was declared as the Pania sanctuary. The wastelands and community lands around Gir were notified as protected forests. A patch of forest near Gir in Mitiyala, historically known as a lion habitat, was declared a sanctuary for further consolidation of its habitat. In 2007, Girnar, a lion satellite area, was also declared as a sanctuary. Five PAs—Gir national park, Gir sanctuary, Pania sanctuary, Mitiyala sanctuary and Girnar sanctuary—covering 1,621 sq. km, are presently managed as the Asiatic lion’s habitat.

“In two decades (1995-2015), more than 40% of the total number of lions was spotted outside the Gir landscape. The prey population, predation behaviour of the lion and acceptance of the lion as an honourable animal by the villagers indicate that the present trend may continue in the near future as well,"" the study added.

However, it expressed concern at the massive pace of infrastructure development.

“The development of industries and ports, mining activities, rails and high-speed roads in the coastal area have already impacted the lions. The increased frequency and speed of goods trains in Pipavav-Rajula line has posed a new threat as 10 lions were killed during 2013-15,"" it noted.

“The change in land-use pattern and disappearance of wastelands and community lands are other issues of concern,"" the analysis added.

“The increasing population of lions will not sustain in Gujarat in coming years. Not just lion-human conflicts but other problems too, like unnatural deaths and genetic disorders, will surface. Keeping lions only in Gujarat is also against international norms,"" said Ajay Dubey, secretary of non-governmental organization Prayatna, which has long campaigned for moving lions out of Gujarat.

The Supreme Court, in an April 2013 order, directed the Union environment ministry to shift some of Gujarat’s lions to the Kuno wildlife sanctuary in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. But the order has not been implemented so far.

Soon, the King of the Jungle grows tired of being followed, and turns his penetrating, golden eyes directly on the interloper. A few moments pass as the lion sizes up the human stalker, and then the lion gives one very loud, spine-tingling growl.

The visitor quickly rolls up his window and then exhales in what sounds like a moment of pure terror.

The lion majestically continues on his way and the visitor wisely doesn't follow.

The Giant Panda is China’s national treasure, and a powerful symbol for species conservation. The Red Panda, also called the “lesser panda,” doesn’t get nearly as much attention.

But it’s managed and cared for in much the same way.

CGTN’s Hendrik Sybrandy reports.



Zoo in Colorado works to save red pandas from extinction Denver Zoo is part of conservation efforts to protect and expand red panda population

At the Denver Zoo recently, all eyes were on this animal enclosure. It was time to said goodbye to Lali and Masu, two female Red Panda cubs, who were about to be shipped to two other zoos in the U.S.

For years, giant pandas have dominated the panda market. Their cute looks and their story of near-extinction grabbed the public’s attention.

Zoo officials said red pandas, which also come from western China and pre-date giant pandas, are every bit as endangered: only about 1200 in captivity worldwide. And they have lots of fans, too.

Lali and Masu’s departure was mandated by the Species Survival Plan, a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Its goal is to maintain genetically diverse populations of threatened animals like the red panda.

Suzanne Braden is head of Pandas International, a non-profit organization based in Colorado whose mission is to help save the giant pandas. Those animals are bred in much the same way.

“Everybody knows that if you don’t have a large enough gene pool, then if you’re inbreeding, the species is going to get weaker, they’re going to be more susceptible to disease and health issues,” Branden said.

Giant pandas are known as an umbrella species. Efforts to protect them and their Chinese habitat also help red pandas in the wild. Red pandas also feast on bamboo. These animals, which resemble foxes or raccoons, are known for their shyness.

Their parents, Faith and Hamlet, will stay behind while Lali and Masu go their separate ways for the benefit of their species and whole new groups of devoted followers.

The red panda is a red cat bear, which is called Habre in Nepali and Punde Kundo in eastern Nepal. It is a Himalayan member of Carnivora, whose scientific name is Ailurus fulgens and is also called the lesser panda. An adult has about 93 cm to 100 cm in length and 4 kg to 6 kg weight on average. It loves to feed on leaves and shoots of highly fibrous bamboo (nigalo or malingo) though it ingests some other kinds of plants, such as fruits or berries, as their seasonal supplement.

A broad-leaved mixed temperate forest with bamboo is an essential habitat feature for it. It lives in a range of altitudes from 2,500–4,000 m, however; it has been reported to have come down to 1,500 m to 5,000 m. It generally avoids south-facing slopes preferring cooler climate. Habitat loss is affecting over 2,000 mammal species. Habitat fragmentation, habitat destruction and habitat loss due to deforestation, haphazard collection of forest products, uncontrolled livestock grazing, unmanaged road construction, inefficiently managed tourism are serious threats for it. Domestic dogs and poaching are other threats to a red panda.

According to Red Panda Network, the global population of red pandas is estimated to be less than 10,000 in the wild. Population of red pandas is estimated at 237 to 1061 in Nepal. Its population is declining due to low fecundity, high infant mortality rate, parasitic infection, population isolation, bamboo flowering and anthropogenic threats. It is a protected species in Nepal, India, China, Bhutan and Myanmar.

Around 22,400 km2 of Nepal is a suitable habitat for red pandas, which is 56.25 percent of potential red panda habitat in the Hindukush Himalaya. About 36 districts of Nepal are potential habitats for it. Its occupancy has been confirmed in 24 districts of Nepal so far. LNP (Langtang National Park) is one of the prime habitats of red pandas. LNPBZ (Langtang National Park Buffer Zone) covers an area of 418.3 km2 adjoining Nuwakot, Rasuwa and Sindhupalchok districts of Nepal. There are altogether 21 User Groups of LNPBZ. Red panda poaching and anthropogenic pressure on it should be controlled immediately. More people oriented conservation programs would increase effectiveness. Sufficient drinking water, proper education, health facility and electricity in such buffer zone communities would avoid biotic pressure not only on red pandas but also on biodiversity conservation as a whole.

But now, the health of this rare rhino is failing, and the subspecies might be one step closer to extinction.

Sudan, a 45-year-old male northern white rhino, is suffering from a nasty infection on his back right leg, which festered underneath an age-related ailment he developed last year. This new infection is not responding to treatment, and his keepers are considering euthanasia if the pain gets to be too much for him. (Read: ""To Rescue or Not, That is the Question With Distressed Animals"")

""It has been a struggle,"" says Kaddu Sebunya, president of the African Wildlife Foundation. ""We're so concerned that the male rhino is now ailing, and we might lose him. We're in a hopeless situation.""

""This is a very good example of Africa losing the heritage,"" says Sebunya, who is based in Nairobi, Kenya, but from Uganda. ""How can we explain this to the next generation of Africans? We can't be so arrogant and neglect other African species.""

Slipping Away

Even from this shrunken population, northern white rhino numbers continue to dwindle. In November 2015, a 41-year-old female northern white rhino named Nola had to be euthanized at the San Diego Zoo because of a string of painful illnesses. A few months earlier in July of that same year, Nabiré, a 31-year-old female, died at a zoo in the Czech Republic after complications from a ruptured cyst. A 34-year-old male named Suni died in October 2014 due to natural causes.

Natural breeding doesn't seem to be a viable option at this point, and it's practically impossible unless a male can be found in the wild. But that situation is unlikely, so scientists have turned to the lab for ideas on how to save this dying species. They've harvested sex cells from the living rhinos and have made steps toward in vitro fertilization with southern white rhino surrogates. But this effort could take more than a decade. (Related: read about how scientists get rare animals to mate.)

Orphaned By Poachers, a Baby Rhino Makes a New Friend WATCH: In South Africa's Pilanesberg National Park, a baby rhino was orphaned by poachers, but with the kindness and hard work of park staff and animal welfare organizations, she's now in a safe home, and even has a new friend.

What About Southern White Rhinos?

White rhinos are one of five species of rhinoceros. They're further divided into two subspecies: northern and southern white rhinos. Northern white rhinos are smaller than southern ones, with straight backs, flat skulls, no grooves between their ribs, hairy ears and tails, and squat front horns. Southern white rhinos are larger, have concave skulls and backs with pronounced shoulder humps, more overall body hair, grooves between their ribs, and longer front horns.

Like their northern counterparts, southern white rhinos have faced similar population declines. At the turn of the century, there were only a handful of the subspecies left—they're historically native to parts of southern Africa. Government conservation efforts have helped to revitalize the population in South Africa to some 20,000 rhinos, thanks to breeding and relocation programs, as well as controlled but controversial sport hunting.

But in recent years, the legal rhino horn trade has returned to South Africa, and southern white rhinos are still considered near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.";Survival of Northern White Rhino Hinges on Last Sick Male;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LzAzL25vcnRoZXJuLXdoaXRlLXJoaW5vLWVuZGFuZ2VyZWQtc3BlY2llcy1zcGQv0gFzaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkubmF0aW9uYWxnZW9ncmFwaGljLmNvbS9kaXN0cmlidXRpb24vcHVibGljL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDMvbm9ydGhlcm4td2hpdGUtcmhpbm8tZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1zcGVjaWVzLXNwZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2018/03/02/sudan-death-watch/06-sudan-death-watch-replacement.ngsversion.1520036335200.adapt.1900.1.jpg;2018-03-02;"[{'sent': 'But now, the health of this rare rhino is failing, and the subspecies might be one step closer to extinction.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'Sudan, a 45-year-old male northern white rhino, is suffering from a nasty infection on his back right leg, which festered underneath an age-related ailment he developed last year.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan']}}, {'sent': '""It has been a struggle,"" says Kaddu Sebunya, president of the African Wildlife Foundation.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Kaddu Sebunya'], 'ORG': ['the African Wildlife Foundation']}}, {'sent': 'A platoon of armed guards watch over Sudan, one of the last northern white rhinoceroses brought from a zoo in the Czech Republic in an effort to save the almost extinct species.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['the Czech Republic', 'Sudan'], 'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'Photograph by Ami Vitale,', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ami Vitale']}}, {'sent': '""This is a very good example of Africa losing the heritage,"" says Sebunya, who is based in Nairobi, Kenya, but from Uganda.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Sebunya'], 'GPE': ['Uganda', 'Kenya', 'Nairobi']}}, {'sent': 'In November 2015, a 41-year-old female northern white rhino named Nola had to be euthanized at the San Diego Zoo because of a string of painful illnesses.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Nola']}}, {'sent': 'A few months earlier in July of that same year, Nabiré, a 31-year-old female, died at a zoo in the Czech Republic after complications from a ruptured cyst.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['the Czech Republic', 'Nabiré']}}, {'sent': 'A 34-year-old male named Suni died in October 2014 due to natural causes.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Suni']}}, {'sent': 'Orphaned By Poachers, a Baby Rhino Makes', 'ents': {'ORG': ['By Poachers']}}, {'sent': 'a New Friend WATCH:', 'ents': {'ORG': ['New Friend']}}, {'sent': ""In South Africa's Pilanesberg National Park, a baby rhino was orphaned by poachers, but with the kindness and hard work of park staff and animal welfare organizations, she's now in a safe home, and even has a new friend.\n\n"", 'ents': {'GPE': [""South Africa's""], 'ORG': ['Pilanesberg National Park']}}, {'sent': 'White rhinos are one of five species of rhinoceros.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one', 'five']}}, {'sent': ""They're further divided into two subspecies: northern and southern white rhinos."", 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'Government conservation efforts have helped to revitalize the population in South Africa to some 20,000 rhinos, thanks to breeding and relocation programs, as well as controlled but controversial sport hunting.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['South Africa'], 'CARDINAL': ['some 20,000']}}, {'sent': 'But in recent years, the legal rhino horn trade has returned to South Africa, and southern white rhinos are still considered near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['South Africa'], 'ORG': ['the International Union for Conservation of Nature']}}]";Negative;2018;3;2018;3;320876

But when he died on Monday night, the news was met with international dismay.

The 45-year-old male rhino had been living under armed guard at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Earlier this month, Sudan developed an infection on his back right leg. He had already been suffering from age-related complications, and the infection worsened his condition.

Now, only two female northern white rhinos remain at the conservancy—the last of their kind on Earth.

Sudan, the Last Remaining Male White Rhino, Has Died

Is All Hope Lost?

Sudan's death is largely seen as the final signature on the species' death warrant.

There was a major conservation push to help Sudan produce an offspring. In one last ditch effort to raise money for the rhino's care, conservationists created a Tinder profile for Sudan.

Documenting Sudan and the species decline was a major project for National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale.

""Today, we are witnessing the extinction of a species that had survived for millions of years but could not survive mankind,"" Vitale wrote in an Instagram post sharing the news.

Vitale was with Sudan when the rhino was transferred from a zoo in the Czech Republic to the Kenya reserve in 2009. It was thought that the African climate and having more room to roam would stimulate the rhinos to breed. (Meet the heroes who protect the last northern white rhinos.)

Because he is past reproductive age and the two females are unable to produce offspring naturally, scientists were attempting to breed a new rhino in a lab.

Sex cells were harvested from the living northern white rhinos, and scientists are hoping to use IVF to impregnate southern white rhino surrogates. The technology to pull this off is still being perfected.

""There's no guarantee that [IVF] will work,"" says Philip Muruthi, vice president of species protection at the African Wildlife Foundation. And he adds that it's extremely expensive and could cost more than $9 million.

""This is a bitter lesson of species conservation,"" says Muruthi. He notes that, while protection is costly, ""the costs of recovery are even higher.""

Rhinos in Africa

In 2014, there were only seven of the sub species on the planet—all in zoos. By the summer of 2015, the number had dwindled to four; a few months later there were only three.

But when the northern white rhino population began to decline, it was lightning fast.

In Sudan's last days, rangers at Ol Pejeta kept the three rhinos under 24/7 armed guard. Despite the species precipitous conservation status, the animals face an intense threat from poaching.

Like elephants, rhinos in Africa are aggressively hunted for their lucrative horns and skin.

In 2013, another rhino subspecies, the western black rhino, was declared extinct. The eastern black rhino, numbering around a thousand, could be the next rhino species facing extinction.";After Last Male's Death, Is the Northern White Rhino Doomed?;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LzAzL25vcnRoZXJuLXdoaXRlLXJoaW5vLW1hbGUtc3VkYW4tZGVhdGgtZXh0aW5jdGlvbi1zcGQv0gF8aHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkubmF0aW9uYWxnZW9ncmFwaGljLmNvbS9kaXN0cmlidXRpb24vcHVibGljL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDMvbm9ydGhlcm4td2hpdGUtcmhpbm8tbWFsZS1zdWRhbi1kZWF0aC1leHRpbmN0aW9uLXNwZA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2018/03/20/sudan-white-rhino/sudan-white-rhino-DSC_4822.ngsversion.1521564804435.adapt.1900.1.jpg;2018-03-20;"[{'sent': ""Conservationists were expecting the death of Sudan, the world's last remaining male northern white rhinoceros."", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan']}}, {'sent': 'The 45-year-old male rhino had been living under armed guard at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Kenya']}}, {'sent': 'Earlier this month, Sudan developed an infection on his back right leg.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan']}}, {'sent': 'Now, only two female northern white rhinos remain at the conservancy—the last of their kind on Earth.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['only two']}}, {'sent': 'Sudan, the Last Remaining Male White Rhino, Has Died\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan'], 'ORG': ['the Last Remaining Male White Rhino']}}, {'sent': ""Sudan's death is largely seen as the final signature on the species' death warrant.\n\n"", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan']}}, {'sent': 'There was a major conservation push to help Sudan produce an offspring.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan']}}, {'sent': ""In one last ditch effort to raise money for the rhino's care, conservationists created a Tinder profile for Sudan.\n\n"", 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one'], 'GPE': ['Sudan']}}, {'sent': 'Documenting Sudan and the species decline was a major project for National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan'], 'ORG': ['National Geographic'], 'PERSON': ['Ami Vitale']}}, {'sent': '""Today, we are witnessing the extinction of a species that had survived for millions of years but could not survive mankind,"" Vitale wrote in an Instagram post sharing the news.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Vitale']}}, {'sent': 'Vitale was with Sudan when the rhino was transferred from a zoo in the Czech Republic to the Kenya reserve in 2009.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Vitale'], 'GPE': ['the Czech Republic', 'Kenya', 'Sudan']}}, {'sent': 'Because he is past reproductive age and the two females are unable to produce offspring naturally, scientists were attempting to breed a new rhino in a lab.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}, {'sent': 'Sex cells were harvested from the living northern white rhinos, and scientists are hoping to use IVF to impregnate southern white rhino surrogates.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['IVF']}}, {'sent': '""There\'s no guarantee that [IVF] will work,"" says Philip Muruthi, vice president of species protection at the African Wildlife Foundation.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Philip Muruthi'], 'ORG': ['the African Wildlife Foundation']}}, {'sent': ""And he adds that it's extremely expensive and could cost more than $9 million.\n\n"", 'ents': {'MONEY': ['more than $9 million']}}, {'sent': '""This is a bitter lesson of species conservation,"" says Muruthi.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Muruthi']}}, {'sent': 'In 2014, there were only seven of the sub species on the planet—all in zoos.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['only seven']}}, {'sent': 'By the summer of 2015, the number had dwindled to four; a few months later there were only three.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['only three', 'four']}}, {'sent': 'A platoon of armed guards watch over Sudan, a northern white rhinoceros that was the last male of its kind.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan']}}, {'sent': 'Photograph by Ami Vitale,', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ami Vitale']}}, {'sent': ""In Sudan's last days, rangers at Ol Pejeta kept the three rhinos under 24/7 armed guard."", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sudan'], 'CARDINAL': ['three']}}]";Positive;2018;3;2018;3;320876

(PTI)

It is just sad to see how animals that once roamed the earth with majestic dignity are now on the verge of getting extinct or are lost in time. After Passenger Pigeon, Tasmanian Tiger, Dodo among others, the northern white rhino is on the verge of extinction. The world’s last male northern white rhino has died leaving only two females left to save the subspecies from extinction. The Rhino was named as Sudan and was a 45-year-old animal. He had been in poor health in the recent days and was being treated for age-related issues and multiple infections.

Following Sudan’s death Indian cricketer Rohit Sharma took to Instagram and posted a picture of himself with Sudan and expressed his melancholy over the demise. “The last Male has fallen We Did This the last Northern White African male rhino marks the certain extinction of this incredible species. Rest in peace Sudan, you deserved so much better. On behalf of all mankind, I’m sorry We Did This.”

A team of veterinarians had made the decision to euthanize Sudan after his health had deteriorated significantly, the conservation group WildAid announced on Tuesday.

Sudan lived in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Kenya and was surrounded by armed guards to protect him from poachers. Elodie Sampere, OL Pejeta spokesperson in an interview with CNN said: “He was a gentle giant, his personality was just amazing and given his size, a lot of people were afraid of him. But there was nothing mean about him.”

Scientists were able to save the rhino’s genetic material in the hopes of artificially inseminating one of the two females.

But perhaps few were as personally struck as the caretakers who had the crucial job of protecting his life.

A team of veterinarians, conservationists, and armed guards watched over the critically endangered animal at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.

On Saturday morning, the conservancy held a memorial service for Sudan, whose death leaves just two of his kind remaining on Earth.

The ceremony, a tribute to his life, began with the Kenyan national anthem, a poem, and a minute of silence. (See heart-wrenching photos of rhinos fighting to survive.)

""Fare thee well Sudan,"" the conservancy posted on its Facebook page. ""You have done your work to highlight the plight of rhino species across the world; now the onus is on us to ensure that rhino populations thrive across our planet.""

One of the speakers was James Mwenda, who was among Sudan's keepers and spoke about the rhino's life, urging the world not to let his death be in vain. A carrot—the rhino's favorite food—was placed on a ceremonial plaque.

The guest of honor, Cabinet Secretary for Wildlife and Tourism Najib Balala, also spoke at the event.

Poaching Pandemic

Sudan's health began failing early this year. In early March, he developed an infection on his back leg that, combined with age-related complications, proved too much for the rhino to overcome. The conservancy euthanized him after realizing he was barely able to stand.

Sudan, the Last Remaining Male White Rhino, Has Died

While Sudan's death paints a grim picture, the conservancy doesn't want to lose sight of the conservation issues Sudan brought to the forefront.

Rhino horns, used in some Chinese medicines and crafts, are some of the most lucrative animal parts o the illegal wildlife market. (Read National Geographic's 2016 investigation of the deadly trade.)

Just over 29,000 rhinos are left on Earth, but before the 19th century, they numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Rhino poaching has dramatically increased over the past decade.

""It’s a war,"" said Xolani Nicholus Funda, chief ranger at Kruger National Park, said in the 2016 article. ""That’s our frustration. The rhino war—it’s like drugs.""

Shining a Spotlight

Last April, Sudan famously helped spread awareness about rhino conservation when his keepers created a profile for him on a dating app.

Seemingly lighthearted, the profile was intended to raise money to fund artificial insemination research.

From a conservation perspective, this does not sound like a big deal. Sudan was one old rhino. He was well past breeding age. So why did his death make headlines?

Sudan was the last surviving male northern white rhinoceros, a subspecies known to scientists as Ceratotherium simum cottoni that went extinct in the wild about 20 years ago thanks to poaching. He was captured and removed from the wild in 1975, the last wild-caught northern white rhino. Sudan’s daughter Najin, and granddaughter Fatu, are now the only two left, and they are both old and incapable of reproduction even if they had a mate.

It is a strange situation. On the one hand, it matters a lot. The northern white rhino is extinct, it just doesn’t know it yet. Conservationists refer to such populations as “the living dead”.

On the other hand, does it really matter? Despite persistent misreporting in the media (and some debate among scientists) the northern white is generally recognised as “only” a subspecies of the white rhinoceros. It is survived by its relative the southern white rhino, Ceratotherium simum simum, around 20,000 of which remain. The species as a whole is not currently endangered.

Resurrection?

The importance of Sudan’s actual death remains unclear, partly because it seems increasingly possible to bring his subspecies back to life. The northern white rhino may be resurrected by Jurassic Park-style technology. That would require conservationists to collect eggs from the remaining females and develop IVF techniques that are as yet unproven on rhino.

Jason Gilchrist , Author provided

DNA has been stored from 13 northern white rhino that died in recent years, including Sudan, and it would be combined with similarly-frozen eggs and sperm. The embryos produced would then be implanted within surrogate female southern white rhino. I recently spoke to Professor Thomas Hildebrandt, a global leader in conservation reproduction and pioneer of this technique, and he was confident it would work.

If these optimistic plans play out, the first northern white rhino calf born since the year 2000 could be produced before the death of the two remaining females. An alternative would be to produce a genetically-engineered baby rhino that is a hybrid of both northern and southern species. If plans to resurrect the extinct woolly mammoth via hybridisation with Indian elephants are possible, then a white rhino hybrid is not unachievable.

Nevertheless, we are talking not about saving a subspecies from extinction, but resurrecting an extinct subspecies – a much more challenging proposition.

Southern white rhinos to the rescue

The second issue, that clouds the importance of the almost certain extinction of the northern white rhino, is that the white rhino survives through its southern subspecies which may (with help) be able to replace the northern white rhino in its historical range across central Africa. In doing so, it could fill the vacant ecological niche.

We, as a society, have to be pragmatic and economic with the resources available to protect wild animals. Can we justify spending an estimated £7.1m (US$10m) to try to bring back to life a subspecies from stored DNA with limited genetic diversity? Even if the animals were all alive and breeding, there would still be fears of the “founder effect” that can occur when a population is started from just a few individuals, with some traits lost and others dominant within the resulting population.

As a near-extinct subspecies, the conservation argument for continued investment to save the population is based upon whatever adaptive genetic diversity it holds that differentiates it from the other subspecies. But it is not clear exactly what genetically-useful traits are found in the sample of 13 northern white rhinos that are not also present in the southern white.

To be direct, if millions of pounds can be raised to try and resurrect the northern white rhino, should it not instead be invested in protecting the southern white rhino (still at risk from poaching)? Or alternatively, direct the money towards even more vulnerable Asian rhinos.

Living museum exhibits

It is easy to see why cutting edge reproductive technology is so appealing now that the planet’s sixth mass extinction crisis is well under way.

Jason Gilchrist , Author provided

But the only economic and practical long-term solution to biodiversity loss is to conserve wildlife in the wild and to prevent it from reaching the sorry state of the northern white rhino. After all, if humans cannot save a species in nature while it is alive, what future for animals that we manufacture? My worry is that they would simply be living museum exhibits, destined to live out their lives in zoos, with habitat loss or poaching preventing life in the wild. Where would this end?

A blue whale and its calf were captured on drone video by photographer Domenic Biagini Wednesday about 12 miles off the coast of Mission Beach.

The beautiful sight isn't something many videographers have the chance to see, Biagini told 10News.

""This kind of footage of a blue whale calf pretty much doesn’t exist. It’s me and the Our Planet documentary people that have ever captured something like this. That’s about it,"" he said.

The large animals generally follow the path of krill in coastal waters, Biagini said. If there's an abundance of krill the whales will spend nearly the entire summer close by, making for some excellent whale-watching opportunities.

""Last few years they haven’t stayed past the end of July because our water gets so warm that it’s not conducive to krill production,"" Biagini said.

But even with the footage, we still know little about the mating and breeding habits of blue whales, Biagini added.

""We have an idea where some of the animals are going to give birth, but that’s only a select few, and still doesn’t include any concrete evidence,"" he said. ""There’s only a handful of people in the world to have filmed a baby blue with any kind of professional equipment. And an even smaller few to film something as intimate as I just did in what has to be some of the calmest conditions imaginable.""

The study, published in the journal Mammal Research, reveals that the new tiger mom made time for her cubs by abandoning defense of her territory, traveling more rapidly from kills, making fewer but larger kills, and resting less.

The Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica), sometimes referred to as the Siberian tiger, is currently listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List.

Poaching is now the biggest threat to the wild Amur tigers, as tiger parts continue to be in high demand throughout Asia for use as ornaments, in traditional medicine, and as a status symbol.

Being a single mom is tough, even for a strong and formidable tigress. Hunting, protecting the territory, spending time with the cubs, resting — how does she do it all?

For the first time ever, scientists were able to document the behavior of a GPS-collared Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the wild for the four months before and four months after the birth of her cubs. The study, published in journal Mammal Research, reveals the sacrifices and changes the new mother, called Vavarra, made to care for her young.

“This study shows that even tigers struggle balancing ‘work’ and ‘family time.’ It’s a constant balancing act to keep their cubs safe while trying to keep themselves fed,” Dale Miquelle, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s (WCS) Russia program and tiger program coordinator, said in a statement.

Tiger cubs are vulnerable to predation from wolves, bears, lynxes and leopards, so Vavarra’s strategy was to spend as much time with her cubs as possible to keep them protected. To achieve this balance, she abandoned defending her territory, moved around less, traveled more rapidly, made fewer but larger kills, and spent a lot less time resting.

“The results simply provide a more graphic understanding of what we already intuitively know — that raising kids is hard, and for single moms, it is especially hard. Tigresses need to make sacrifices, and balance protection and nurture to be successful. Many cubs are no doubt lost during this early period,” Miquelle told Mongabay.

Once her cubs were born, Vavarra greatly reduced the size of her range from around 500 square kilometers (193 square miles) down to 180 km2 (70 mi2). Overall, she spent less time moving, but when she did travel, she moved more quickly, especially when returning home from a kill. When the cubs were old enough to travel, she brought them with her to kill sites where she could both protect and feed the cubs and herself.

“A tiger, like most large carnivores, is in a continual race trying to stay ahead of starvation,” Miquelle said. “Any slight injury, or a few missed opportunities, put a tiger at a huge risk of not making it. So when you add the additional burdens of ‘how do I keep my cubs safe from other predators?’ and ‘how do I make sure that not only am I fed, but how do I get enough calories to my cubs to keep them fed?’ you can see the dilemma.”

The Amur tiger, sometimes referred to as the Siberian tiger (though it doesn’t live in Siberia), is currently listed as an endangered species on the IUCN Red List. A 2015 census estimated between 523 to 540 individuals in the wild, though there haven’t been any scientifically rigorous surveys of the wild population, according to Miquelle. And, because the majority of the Amur tiger population lives in the harsh environment of the Russian Far East, they are notoriously difficult to study.

“Getting this information is not easy. The fact that no one has done this before is an indication of the difficulty,” Miquelle said. “Because we had a GPS collar on Vavarra, those locations came regularly. But to find out what she was doing required us to be in the field nearly every day, checking locations where she had been.”

By finding Vavarra’s tracks in the snow, the scientists were able to “walk in her footsteps and essentially relive those moments with her,” Miquelle said. Retracing her steps allowed the team to find the kills she made, estimate how long she stayed at kills, and get a sense of how she traveled to and from those sites.

“Our goal is to never see the tiger to avoid influencing her behavior, but to be constantly ‘one step behind,’” Miquelle said. “For me, it is a real privilege to be able to walk in the steps of a tiger. It never gets old.”

In the 1930s, Amur tigers were on the verge of extinction, with a population of around 30 animals. Conservation measures, such as a strict ban on hunting enforced by dedicated rangers, brought the tigers back from the brink. However, tigers still face substantial threats from habitat loss, roads, illegal hunting of tiger prey such as deer and wild boar, and poaching.

Tiger parts continue to be in high demand throughout Asia for use as ornaments, in traditional medicine, and as a status symbol. The availability of tiger parts from breeding facilities known as “tiger farms” legitimizes and increases this demand, contributing to the main threat to the wild tiger, poaching. The Wildlife Conservation Society estimates that, in the Russian Far East, 20-30 tigers are poached every year.

“I never cease to be amazed by [the tiger’s] strength, adaptability, and persistence,” Miquelle said. “But it is because of these characteristics that they are sought after for traditional medicines by people who believe in the curative process of tiger body parts. Unless people from Asian cultures change their appetite for tiger medicines, we could lose tigers in the wild, and the miracle of their existence would be gone.”

Rusty and Yuki, the Amur tiger cubs born and bred at Longleat, have caught attention across the country.

With their mother and father, Yana and Red, having been placed at Longleat as part of a Europe-wide breeding programme intended to help repopulate one of the most endangered species in the world, Rusty and Yuki have become part of the furniture at the park.

Born on June 17 2019, the cubs are now eight months old and growing fast.

They were shown to the public for the first time late last year, with mum Yana still very much in attendance.

Yana herself, who is now four years old, was brought into the park in 2018 alongside five-year-old Red, the male Amur tiger who keepers at Longleat think could be one of the biggest big cats in the world.

Keeper Caleb Hall said: ""Male Amur tigers are the biggest big cats on Earth, so if Red is fully grown and is as big as he is going to get he could be one of the biggest cats in the world.

""He is genuinely humongous - we think he's somewhere between two and a half to three metres long from the tip of his nose to the tail, and if he stands up on his back legs he could stand three metres tall.

""He's the biggest big cat we've got here, definitely bigger than the male lions.

""He weighs around 260 kilograms as well - he is a seriously big cat, and we think Rusty could be even bigger one day.""

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""They can be quite naughty sometimes - they're definitely a handful""

While Rusty and Yuki are only eight months old, they are growing very quickly.

Rusty, the male cub, is growing larger than the female Yuki and it is estimated he will rival his mother for size within a year and he will be comparable to his father when he is around four years old.

Yuki herself was weighed in at around 30kgs in December 2019 and keepers estimate she has doubled in size since.

The cubs are already starting to develop their own personalities and the keepers have observed a definite pattern in their behaviour that is mirrored in their parents.

Caleb said: ""They're cheeky little things - they can be quite naughty sometimes, they're definitely a handful.

""They're almost like kittens but they're the size of golden retrievers!

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""They've got the same reactions and instincts as kittens, the urges to swat at things, stalk and chase around, but they're the size of larger dogs.

""They're quite typical of their sex in a lot of ways - Rusty is almost identical to Red, he's got the same markings and stripes and behaviours, he carries the same mannerisms, he even runs the same way.

""Equally, Yuki is exactly like Yara, very sweet-natured, likes to stay clean and follows mum around, liking to watch what's going on rather than get involved - they are carbon copies of their parents.

""The problem is when they do play, Rusty is a lot bigger than Yuki already so he tends to win!

""Rusty just wants to play relentlessly - I think Yara is starting to get a little tired of playing with cubs after eight months if I'm honest, she's starting to ignore him a bit more.""

'If someone goes on holiday they barely recognise them when they come back'

The rate the cubs are growing is causing some excitement among the keepers.

The large appetites and fast growth is leading to a situation where a few days without seeing the cubs can leave a keeper surprised when they do return.

However, they still rely on their parents, as all children will do.

Caleb said: ""They don't stop eating and they don't stop growing.

""They grow amazingly quickly - if someone goes on holiday they are genuinely shocked to see them so much bigger when they come back.

""Rusty is probably already half as big as Yara and probably weighs 60kg.

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""They're growing and are definitely developing their own characters but they are still relying on mum to make big decisions.

""They're still relatively dependent on Yara at the moment but we're starting to see them having some more of their freedom around the paddock, they've got so much space so they can.

""Yara is a very good mum but they are her first cubs so she makes mistakes as any new parent does - she lets them get away with things here and there and maybe regrets it later.

""She was a very protective mum when they were young, but since they've come to about five months old she's been much less threatened by us keepers being around.

""Red still definitely does his part too. In the wild he would protect their area, so he goes in there at night and prowls around and they smell him there in the day - it makes them all a lot more comfortable when they know he's been somewhere.""

The future of the Amur tiger across Europe

The programme in which Longleat are involved stretches across Europe and may involve the resettlement of bred tigers in other locations to encourage breeding.

The species is being monitored across the centres and each cub, if it is intended to be bred from, will be matched up to a suitable mate in another location to ensure the protection of the best genes amongst the species.

The decisions on if and where Rusty and Yuki will be moved to and will breed will be made quite a way down the track, however, since the cubs are still very young.

Caleb said: ""We are given recommendations on how to move tigers around based on the best breeding options for them, we're not quite sure when this decision will be taken but it won't be any time soon.

(Image: www.longleat.co.uk)

""There's no pressure on Longleat to move them, we've got plenty of space set up for them so it's about what's right for the species.

""To be honest, we didn't expect to have the cubs so early so it's great for us to have them at all.""

However, even though Rusty and Yuki will not be moved out of Longleat any time soon, they may have to be separated more within the park as time goes on.

Plenty of separate pens have been built already to accommodate them if needed and the increasing independence the cubs will start to develop may necessitate this separation.

Caleb said: ""When they get to the age in the wild that Yana would want them gone, we will start to separate them.

""They've got a big pen with plenty of space so it may only have to happen for feeding times initially, but as Rusty in particular gets close to his mother's size he may well start to dominate at feeding times and that sort of thing.

""By this stage they all eat separate chunks of meat now, as opposed to when they were younger and they would all share.

""They probably go through about 50kg of meat between the three of them in a week at the moment, but we could feed them every day and Rusty would still be hungry at the end of every day - he's got an insatiable appetite.

""He's like his dad that way - Red can go through 40 to 50kg of meat in one sitting if he wants to.""

'They're our pride and joy'

This is the first time in years Longleat has hosted tiger cubs and the keepers are aware of how big a deal this is.

They have already developed a deep affection for Rusty and Yuki and are excited to see them experiencing life at Longleat.

Caleb said: ""They are absolutely great and we as keepers love them to pieces.

""The whole generation of keepers here have never had tiger cubs before.

""It's great to see them out around the drive-through around the park, interacting as best they can with visitors that come through - they're out there most days now.

The incredibly rare Amur Tiger was trying to cross a main road near Gogolevka village in the Primorsky Krai, a federal subject in the Far East region of Russia on the border of both China and North Korea. The bus driver reportedly had no way of avoiding the tiger cub.

A video caught the moment the endangered cub was hit. After it was hit, the cub got back up but was dazed and confused. The baby tiger then stumbled back into the woods. The driver reported the accident and a hunting patrol later found the tiger’s remains.

The animal is thought to have died from its injuries and was found to be aged just four or five months old. Sergey Aramilev, head of the Amur Tiger Centre dedicated to saving the threatened species, commented: “This is a truly tragic death of a tiger cub, and in this story there are a number of questions that are not yet answered. “The main one is why the tiger cub was alone on the road, without its mother, which at this age should always be there. “Experts of hunting supervision are now trying to get an answer to this and other questions.” READ MORE: Lethal two-headed cobra discovered which could kill 20 people

“It is truly a tragic set of circumstances: an accident occurred in the dark, this section of the road is not lit, and the cub jumped out in front of the bus at the most inopportune moment. “The driver did not have any chance to avoid the collision…the driver acted correctly, he avoided injuring passengers and almost saved the animal.” But experts are determined to find out the fate of the cub’s mother. “It is very important to understand what happened to the tigress,” he added. “In the best case, she is healthy and alive, and in the worst, some disaster happened to her, and the tiger cub, left alone, went on his last trip.

What’s black and white and not all over? The answer, unfortunately, is the giant panda. While conservation efforts are underway, these cuddly creatures are facing serious problems in the wild. In honor of National Panda Day on March 16th, let’s take a look at the threats to these gentle giants, as well as learn some fascinating facts about them. Bonus: Adorable pics ahead!

The panda’s plight

Mainly because of habitat loss, there aren’t many giant pandas left in the world. That’s a common problem with many wild animal species you probably never realized were endangered. Other reasons the panda population is threatened: Illegal poaching for the black market remains a problem, pandas often have difficult pregnancies, and mother pandas only have enough milk to feed one cub, even though two or three cubs are often born at once. Plus, pandas are really picky in choosing a mate.

So, how dire is the situation? The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says there are just 1,864 pandas left in the wild. There are an additional 400 pandas in captivity, according to Pandas International. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the giant panda as “vulnerable,” which is the category between “near threatened” and “endangered.” However, there is some good news: The population has started to increase slightly, thanks to breeding programs in China.

Their home turf

All existing pandas come from the bamboo forests of central China, so it’s appropriate to greet them with nǐ hǎo (pronounced “nee haow”), which is how you say “hello” in Mandarin. Pandas also used to live in Laos, Myanmar/Burma, and Vietnam, according to Sciencing.com.

Giant pandas have their own language

Hung_Chung_Chih/Getty ImagesPandas won’t say “hello” back, of course, but scientists say they have more varied vocalizations than any other type of bear. The San Diego Zoo reports that pandas growl, huff, squeak, bark, honk, coo, tweet, and even bleat like lambs.

Pandas International describes a linguistics project by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. Researchers have figured out the meaning behind 13 different panda noises. They say that a mother panda will bark when a stranger approaches her cub and that male pandas baa like sheep when they’re in love. Supposedly, when a baby panda makes a “gee-gee” sound, it means “I’m hungry,” and “wow-wow” means the panda isn’t happy.

The perfect panda picnic

Giant pandas look a lot like teddy bears, especially when they sit down and stretch out their hind legs, a posture National Geographic says they like to use when eating. Speaking of which, a panda’s favorite meal is bamboo. In fact, these gentle giants rarely eat anything else and spend half of every day eating the fibrous stuff. However, bamboo isn’t the most nutritious of foods, especially for big animals like pandas. Bamboo is very low in protein, and the IUCN says pandas can digest less than 30 percent of it. A giant panda needs to eat between 25 and 40 pounds of bamboo daily, as well as have a sedentary lifestyle, to stay alive and healthy. Here are more panda facts that will make you love them even more.

Be glad you’re not a panda

Sure, it might seem like a nice life just to sit around all day and snack on your favorite food. But know that if you were a giant panda, you’d need to get off your couch and visit the bathroom a lot. According to the IUCN, a panda poops at least 100 times a day. Plus, when the bamboo in their territory is gone, pandas have to migrate to search for more.

Leave me alone!

Pascale Gueret/Getty ImagesPandas generally like to be by themselves. They do get together to mate in the spring and a mother will raise her cub until it’s 18 to 24 months old, but otherwise, pandas prefer to be alone with their bamboo. Interestingly enough, studies show that pandas “talk” when they do get together.

Here’s what we do know: Pandas rely on their excellent sense of smell to help avoid one another, says National Geographic. They also use smell to find a mate when they’re ready to have a break from all of that alone time.

Why do pandas do handstands?

While pandas generally prefer to sit around by themselves and eat, they can sometimes be seen doing acrobatics. Pandas mark their territories to tell other pandas who they are and to stay away. Their scent gland is underneath their tails, and they rub this area on trees. In order to get the mark as high as possible on a tree (showing that they’re a great big panda that other pandas should avoid), pandas will do a handstand. Plus, adds LiveScience.com, pandas like to hang in trees and do somersaults when they play.

Are they bears, or aren’t they?

Before scientists were able to test panda DNA, they thought that giant pandas might be part of the raccoon family, another animal that has black markings around its eyes. But it is now confirmed that the panda is part of the bear family. That’s unlike the koala bear, which isn’t a bear at all. It is, however, one of these 11 animals with surprisingly misleading names.

Pandas are different from bears in many ways. They don’t store fat and hibernate like their North American bear cousins. They have an extra-long wrist bone that acts like a thumb to make it easier to hold onto bamboo. And technically, the giant panda is classified as a carnivore. Even though they mostly eat bamboo, they will also occasionally eat fish, rats, and other small animals.

And here’s another fun animal comparison: In Mandarin, the name of the giant panda translates as “giant bear cat,” perhaps because of their cat-like vertical pupils or maybe because they like to lie around all day like cats.

The size of a stick of butter

John Moore/Getty ImagesGiant pandas are truly giant when fully grown—males weigh about 300 pounds. But the WWF reports that panda newborns are 1/900th the size of their mamas. They weigh four to six ounces at birth, approximately the same size and weight as a stick of butter in your fridge. When they’re born, baby giant pandas are tiny, pale, and hairless. They only get their distinctive black and white fur when they’re about a month old. Here are some adorable pictures of baby animals you’ll love instantly.

Living fossils

Pandas International calls giant pandas “living fossils” because the species is thought to have existed for three million years. In order to prevent pandas from going extinct, we need to protect the animals and their habitat, as well as help them reproduce in panda breeding centers. So much of the world’s wildlife is at risk and in need of protection—for example, do you know how many cheetahs are left in the world?

How to help giant pandas

Donating to animal conservation organizations like the WWF is a great way to help pandas and to prevent their populations from shrinking. With the WWF, you can even adopt a panda. Pandas are particularly important to the WWF—the group has used the panda as its logo since it was founded in 1961.

Another simple way you can help? By visiting a panda in a zoo. China leases pandas to zoos around the world and uses the funds to preserve pandas in the wild. In China, you can see newborn, baby, and adult pandas at panda centers such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. In the United States, you can see giant pandas at the Memphis Zoo, at the Atlanta Fulton County Zoo, at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute in Washington D.C., and, in Canada, at the Calgary Zoo.

Not to be confused with the red panda (a mammal barely related to the panda bear), the giant panda is the only species of its kind and currently endangered. Listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List, the giant panda only has 500-1,000 mature adult bears existing today. Endangered by a plethora of threats, both human and environmental, the giant panda is a bear that is crucial to our world. If we don't act quickly, our future generations will never be able to see these lovable bamboo-obsessed care bears outside of a photograph or screen.

Organizations like WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) and Pandas International are committed to the conservation of these bears and holidays like National Panda Day are meant to bring awareness to the threats these creatures face.

Giant Panda;Ailuropoda melanoleuca;China;VU;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Ursidae;Ailuropoda;melanoleuca;I;China;;"Happy national panda day! Here at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s Asia Trail exhibit, we are celebrating with giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, as well as our red panda pair, Asa and Jackie. We look forward to special days like these because they give us an opportunity to get extra creative with planning our animals’ activities for the day.

It goes without saying that both giant and red pandas are incredibly charismatic and intelligent. Today and every day, we encourage them to keep physically active and mentally sharp by presenting them with a variety of enrichment. This can be anything from sensory experiences (like spices for scent-anointing or a tub full of bubbles for popping), to physical objects and toys (like boomer balls and puzzle feeders), to social interactions (like husbandry training sessions or painting with keepers) and environmental stimuli (like giving them access to a different yard or adding new groundcover to explore).

No matter which activity or experience we give the pandas, it is important that they have an opportunity to use their natural behaviors and choose how to spend their time. In honor of national panda day, let’s take a look at some of our giant and red pandas’ favorite enrichment activities!";Celebrating National Panda Day;https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWx6b28uc2kuZWR1L2FuaW1hbHMvbmV3cy9jZWxlYnJhdGluZy1uYXRpb25hbC1wYW5kYS1kYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://nationalzoo.si.edu/sites/default/files/newsroom/649a1243-cropped.jpg;2020-03-16;[{'sent': 'Here at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s', 'ents': {'ORG': ['National Zoo', 'Smithsonian']}}, {'sent': 'Asia Trail exhibit, we are celebrating with giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, as well as our red panda pair, Asa and Jackie.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Mei Xiang', 'Tian Tian', 'Asa', 'Jackie']}}];Positive;2020;3;2020;3;411539
Giant Panda;Ailuropoda melanoleuca;China;VU;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Ursidae;Ailuropoda;melanoleuca;I;China;;"A team of reproductive scientists, veterinarians and panda keepers at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute performed an artificial insemination on giant panda Mei Xiang (may-SHONG) yesterday morning, March 22, at 9:45 a.m.

Scientists and keepers had been closely monitoring Mei Xiang’s behavior and hormones since she began displaying behavioral changes March 12, indicating she was entering her breeding season. Hormone analyses determined Mei Xiang’s urinary estrogen concentrations also began to increase on the 12th, meaning she was within a week or so of ovulating and able to become pregnant. Female giant pandas are only in estrus, or able to become pregnant, for 24 to 72 hours each year.

Since the window when a giant panda can conceive a cub is so short, the Zoo’s panda team performed an artificial insemination on Mei Xiang. They artificially inseminated her using frozen semen from Tian Tian (t-YEN t-YEN) for the procedure.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” said Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. “Our team carefully planned this procedure with the safety of staff and Mei Xiang as the number one priority, taking extra precautions due to COVID-19.”

During the past week, Mei Xiang became increasingly restless, wandering her yard, scent-marking, vocalizing and playing in water—all behaviors that increase in intensity before she reaches peak estrus. Tian Tian immediately noticed the hormonal changes in Mei Xiang and began displaying behaviors toward her indicating he was ready to breed. He vocalized to her and constantly tried to keep her in his sight for the past week. During the past few days, he spent much of his time at the “howdy window” that separates their yards. Mei Xiang did not respond positively to any of Tian Tian’s vocalizations until yesterday.

As Mei Xiang exhibited estrus behaviors, the Zoo received approval for its breeding plans from the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which monitors giant panda research programs in the United States. Mei Xiang is 21 and near the end of her reproductive life cycle, but there are pandas who have had cubs when they were older than she is now. Based on data from scientists in China and other zoos with pandas, females can breed into their early 20s.

As a public health precaution due to COVID-19, the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is temporarily closed to the public. Special precautions implemented to minimize person to person contact ahead of Mei Xiang’s artificial insemination included delivering medical supplies and setting up equipment in advance, as well as, limiting the number of staff present during the insemination event. Per usual procedures, the Zoo’s expert team of panda keepers closely watched Mei Xiang’s behavior, which is the best indicator, in addition to hormone analysis, that she has reached peak ovulation. These behaviors include an increase in positive vocalizations like bleats and chirps and walking backward with her tail up. Historically this behavior has tracked with peak estrogen and progesterone rise. Due to the successful banking of semen from Tian Tian over the past several years as part of the Smithsonian’s cryopreservation initiative, the team used frozen semen instead of fresh to reduce overall staff contact time and work load in consideration of the needs of staff and the other animals in the collection.

The Zoo’s webcams, including the giant panda webcam, remain online, but volunteers are not operating them, so animals may not be visible at all times.

The panda team will not know if the artificial insemination was successful for several months. Giant panda pregnancies and pseudopregnancies generally last between three to six months. Veterinarians will conduct ultrasounds to track changes in Mei Xiang’s reproductive tract and determine if she is pregnant during the next several months. Scientists will also monitor her hormones to determine when she is near the end of a pseudopregnancy or pregnancy. There is no way to determine if a female is pregnant by hormone analysis and behavior alone. Mei Xiang’s hormones and behavior will mimic a pregnancy even if she is experiencing a pseudopregnancy. The only definitive way to determine if she is pregnant before giving birth is to see a developing fetus on an ultrasound.

Giant pandas are listed as “vulnerable” in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are an estimated 1,800 in the wild. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is a leader in giant panda conservation. Ever since these charismatic bears arrived at the Zoo in 1972, animal care staff and scientists have studied giant panda biology, behavior, breeding, reproduction and disease. These experts are also leading ecology studies in giant pandas’ native habitat. The Zoo’s giant panda team works closely with colleagues in China to advance conservation efforts around the world. Chinese scientists are working to reintroduce giant pandas to the wild.

The Zoo’s giant Panda reproduction research collaboration contract with the China Wildlife Conservation Association expires Dec. 7. The Zoo is in the process of renewing this agreement.

The zoo announced Monday that they artificially inseminated 21-year-old giant panda Mei Xiang after she displayed signs that she was ready to breed.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” Steven Monfort of the zoo said in a statement.

Panda Watch: Mei Xiang’s Hormones Rise

“Our team carefully planned this procedure with the safety of staff and Mei Xiang as the number one priority, taking extra precautions due to COVID-19,"" he added.

Reproductive scientists, veterinarians and panda keepers artificially inseminated Mei Xiang with frozen semen from Tian Tian, her male panda companion.

The panda couple’s last cub, Bei Bei, moved to China in November. The empty-nesters may be hoping for a new cub to keep them company.

We won’t know if the procedure was successful for a few months, since panda pregnancies last between three to six months, according to the National Zoo.

The operation was conducted by a team of reproductive scientists, veterinarians and panda keepers at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, after they got approval from the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

As of March 12, Mei Xiang started to show behavioral changes — becoming extremely restless, wandering her yard, scent-marking, vocalizing and playing in water –, which indicated that she was entering her breeding season. Scientists and keepers have been monitoring her closely since that date.

They also determined that urinary estrogen concentrations began to increase on the same day, a sign she was about to ovulate.

A team of reproductive scientists, veterinarians & panda keepers performed an AI on giant panda Mei Xiang on March 22, taking extra precautions due to #COVID19. Panda ???? pregnancies & pseudopregnancies last between 3-6 months. #PandaStory #GiantPanda https://t.co/WiQ4n8pc5G — National Zoo (@NationalZoo) March 23, 2020

Female giant pandas are only able to become pregnant for 24 to 72 hours each year after entering this phase, according to the Zoo’s statement, which is the reason why the team had to perform the insemination immediately. Even though Mei Xiang is 21, it is known that females can breed into their early 20s.

For the operation, the team used frozen semen from Tian Tian, who actually noticed the hormonal changes in Mei Xiang and tried to get her attention, showing he was also ready to breed. Mei Xiang, on the other hand, did not respond to his vocalizations until Saturday.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, was quoted as saying in the statement.

Some exciting news for animal lovers: Giant panda Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated over the weekend at the Smithsonian National Zoo! The procedure was performed on Sunday, March 22, after the beloved panda began exhibiting behaviors common with ovulation. Considering female pandas only conceive during a single 24-72 hour period during the year, this marks a huge moment for panda conservation, as reflected in the successful breeding program between China and the United States.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for, and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,"" said Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars Director, Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, said in an official press release.

Having occurred amidst the coronavirus pandemic, zoo staff took necessary measures in protecting themselves and the people around them during the procedure. They also used frozen semen from Tian Tian, which the zoo has collected through the years.

Mei Xiang started displaying signs signaling she was ready to breed on March 12, with the giant panda marking her scent throughout the habitat and playing with her water. She also responded to courtship behaviors by the zoo's panda patriarch, Tian Tian. The male giant panda also fathered Bao Bao and Bei Bei, who have both been transferred to China (Bei Bei left in 2019). Panda breeding season typically begins in March and runs until May, so it seems Mei Xiang is right on schedule!

So when will we know she's pregnant? Female pandas can experience a ""pseudopregnancy,"" which means they can display similar behaviors of pregnancy without actually being pregnant. Both pregnancies and pseudopregnancies last between 3-6 months, so experts won't know her status until they conduct an ultrasound. In the meantime, we'll be waiting by the Panda Cam!

It follows Joseph Maldonado-Passage, better known as “Joe Exotic,” the owner of Oklahoma’s Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, which was, in its heyday, a prominent cub-petting, tiger-breeding operation and private zoo. Now Maldonado-Passage is serving 22 years in prison for plotting to have a critic murdered, killing five tigers, and illegally selling tigers across state lines.

Because the series is character-driven, it doesn’t spend a lot of time on the animal welfare and trade issues that surround the captive-tiger breeding industry. Exotic pets, captive wildlife, the illegal wildlife trade, and even Joe Exotic are topics National Geographic routinely covers, so here’s some contextual information.

Is tiger breeding conservation?

Some private tiger breeders argue that they’re helping shore up tigers, which are endangered in the wild. But their cats will never be released into the wild, both because they wouldn’t know how to fend for themselves and because of their genetics. There are multiple subspecies of tigers in the wild, each adapted to live in a certain part of the world. A Bengal tiger is not a Siberian tiger is not a Sumatran tiger. Most privately owned tigers in the U.S. are of mixed or unknown lineage and therefore are excluded from participating in captive-breeding efforts at accredited zoos and institutions that seek to preserve the subspecies.

What makes a good sanctuary or zoo?

According to the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries, an accrediting organization, a true sanctuary exists to provide lifetime care to animals that have been abused, neglected, discarded, or are otherwise in need of help. A true sanctuary does not breed or allow hands-on interactions with animals, and it maintains high standards of care and operation.

For zoos in the U.S., accreditation by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums requires facilities to go above and beyond the basic requirements set by the government in terms of animal health, welfare, guest education, safety, recordkeeping, and more. Conservation is typically promoted as an important part of a zoo’s mission. (Many other countries have accrediting organizations too.)



“Pseudo-sanctuaries” and “roadside zoos” are loose terms that describe unaccredited facilities with low, or at least problematic, standards of operation and care.

What’s the deal with cub petting?

It’s easy to understand the impulse to want to play with an adorable tiger cub. But did you ever wonder why a facility seems to always have them? Or what happens when they’re not cute and tiny anymore?

Cub-petting facilities often speed-breed their tigers so there’s a constant supply, National Geographic reported in December. As soon as a litter is born, the cubs are removed from the mother, making her go into heat sooner so she can breed again.

Interacting with humans is also stressful for cubs. They’re very young; they’re not with their mother; and they’re being passed around amid bright lights, noise, and milling people that, to their tiny selves, could be predators.

Cubs are only economically (and legally) useful for a short time—eight weeks to 12 weeks old. They quickly get too dangerous to interact with visitors. They may become breeders themselves, or go on exhibit. There’s evidence that some are killed.

What's up with the ligers?

Cross-bred species abound in private zoos and menageries. In the wild, lion-tiger hybrids such as ligers and tigons don’t exist. In fact, the lions and tigers live in separate parts of the world. Cross-breeding species can cause genetic defects and health problems, according to Luke Hunter, a big cat scientist and conservationist, who talked to National Geographic in 2017 about big cat hybrids.

White tigers aren’t hybrids, but they’re not exactly natural, either—at least, not in the numbers we see in captivity. They’re simply tigers with white fur, and they’re rarely found in the wild. Intensive inbreeding to create and sell white tigers over the years means some suffer congenital defects that require lifetime care, wrote AZA CEO Dan Ashe in a recent post.

How can I tell if the tigers are well cared for?

If you’re thinking about visiting a sanctuary or zoo, here are some tips to help you identify ethical and responsible places. Tigers are big, nocturnal, solitary animals, and that means they have some special needs in captivity, according to graduate research by Leigh Pitsko, now at Smithsonian’s National Zoo. They need space to exercise, and they shouldn’t be crowded with other tigers. They need a place to hide if they’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed by human visitors, and they should always have access to shade and water. Toys, activities, and climbing equipment are important for keeping tigers’ brains active, and enclosures with natural flooring substances, not concrete, are important not only for the health of their feet and skin but also for their well-being. The more natural their enclosure, the better.

Featuring eccentric characters with names like Joe Exotic and Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, the series touches on polygamy, addiction and personality cults, while exploring a mysterious disappearance and a murder-for-hire.

To Allison Skidmore, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies wildlife trafficking, the documentary didn’t bring enough attention to the scourge of captive big cats.

A former park ranger, Skidmore first started studying the issue in the U.S. after the infamous death of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe in 2015. She was shocked to learn about how little oversight there was stateside. We asked her about the legality, incentives and ease of buying and selling tigers.

1. How many captive tigers are in the US?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer. The vast majority of captive tigers are crossbred hybrids, so they aren’t identified as members of one of the six tiger subspecies – the Bengal tiger, Amur tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger and Malayan tiger. Instead, they’re classified as “generic.”

Less than 5% – or fewer than 350 – of tigers in captivity are managed through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a nonprofit organization that serves as an accrediting body in the U.S. They ensure accredited facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by law.

All the rest are privately owned tigers, meaning they don’t belong to one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ 236 sponsored institutions. These are considered generic and fall outside of federal oversight.

There’s no legal requirement to register these generic tigers, nor a comprehensive national database to track and monitor them. The best educated guess puts the number of tigers at around 10,000 in the U.S. Estimates put the global captive tiger population as high as 25,000.

In comparison, there are fewer than 4,000 tigers in the wild – down from 100,000 a century ago.

2. How do tigers change hands?

The Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna prevent the importation of tigers from the wild. So all tigers in the U.S. are born in captivity, with the rare exception of an orphaned wild cub that may end up in a zoo.

Only purebred tigers that are one of the six definitive subspecies are accounted for; these are the tigers you see in places like the Smithsonian National Zoo and generally belong to the Species Survival Plan, a captive breeding program designed to regulate the exchange of specific endangered species between member zoos in order to maintain genetic diversity.

All other tigers are found in zoos, sanctuaries, carnivals, wildlife parks, exhibits and private homes that aren’t sanctioned by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They can change hands in any number of ways, from online marketplaces to exotic animal auctions. They can be bought for as little as US$800 to $2,000 for a cub and $200 to $500 for an adult, which is less expensive than many purebred dog puppies.

3. Can I legally buy a tiger?

The U.S. is plagued with complicated and vague laws concerning tiger ownership.

However, there are no federal statutes or regulations that expressly forbid private ownership of tigers. State and local jurisdictions have been given this authority, and some do pass bans or require permits. Thirty-two states have bans or partial bans, and 14 states allow ownership with a simple license or permit. Four states – Alabama, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Nevada – have no form of oversight or regulation at all.

An overarching, cohesive framework of regulations is missing, and even in states that ban private ownership, there are loopholes. For example, in all but three states, owners can apply for what’s called a “federal exhibitor license,” which is remarkably cheap and easy to obtain and circumvents any stricter state or local laws in place.

You now need a permit to transport tigers across state lines, but there’s still no permit required for intra-state travel.

4. What’s in it for the owners?

Some see it as a business venture, while others claim they care about conservation. I consider the latter reason insincere.

Many facilities promote themselves as wildlife refuges or sanctuaries. These places frame their breeding and exhibition practices as stewardship, as if they’re contributing to an endangered animal’s survival. The reality is that no captive tiger has ever been released into the wild, so it’s not like these facilities can augment wild populations. A true sanctuary or refuge should have a strict no breeding or handling policy, and should have education programs dedicated to promoting conservation.

Ultimately, tigers are big money makers, especially tiger cubs. The Animal Welfare Act allows cub petting from eight to 12 weeks of age. People pay $100 to $700 to pet, bottle-feed, swim with or take a photo with a cub.

None of these profits go toward the conservation of wild tigers, and this small window of opportunity for direct public contact means that exhibitors must continually breed tigers to maintain a constant supply of cubs.

The value of cubs declines significantly after 12 weeks. Where do all these surplus tigers go? Unfortunately, due to a lack of regulatory oversight, it’s hard to know.

Since many states don’t account for their live tigers, there’s also no oversight regarding the reporting and disposal of dead tigers. Wildlife criminologists fear that these tigers can easily end up in the black market where their parts can cumulatively be worth up to $70,000. There’s evidence of U.S. captive tigers tied to the domestic black market trade: In 2003, an owner of a tiger “rescue” facility was found to have 90 dead tigers in freezers on his property. And in 2001, an undercover investigation led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ended up leading to the prosecutions of 16 people for buying, selling and slaughtering 19 tigers.

5. What role does social media play?

Posing with tigers on social media platforms like Instagram and on dating apps has become a huge problem. Not only can it create a health and safety risk for both the human and tiger, but it also fosters a false narrative.

If you see thousands of photos of people with captive tigers, it masks the true problem of endangered tigers in the wild. Some might wonder whether tigers are really so endangered if they’re so easy to pose with.

The reality of the wild tiger’s plight has become masked behind the pomp and pageantry of social media. This marginalizes meaningful ideas about conservation and the true status of tigers as one of the most endangered big cats.

Giant Panda;Ailuropoda melanoleuca;China;VU;2020-06-18;Animalia;Mammalia;Carnivora;Ursidae;Ailuropoda;melanoleuca;I;China;;"A middle-aged couple of giant pandas in a Hong Kong theme park have mated for the first time in more than 10 years, after finally enjoying a period of privacy thanks to the coronavirus lockdown.

Ying Ying and Le Le have been at Ocean Park since 2007 but, despite the encouragement of zookeepers, they had shown little inclination to have sex while daily hordes of visitors were watching their every move.

Chinese scientists, after losing patience with natural breeding, extracted sperm from Le Le and artificially inseminated Ying Ying, but this resulted in miscarriages. When the pandemic forced the closure of the park on 26 January, the 14-year-olds were halfway through the panda’s average lifespan and almost a decade past the start of sexual maturity.

But, after more than two months of being alone together, the couple have recently shown signs they were in the mood for love. Local reports say Ying Ying – in her oestrogen cycle – spent more time in the water and Le Le left more scent markings around the enclosure.

On Monday morning, the pair were seen cuddling more intensely than usual and then finally did what comes naturally, much to the delight of park managers.

“The successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination,” Michael Boos, executive director for zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park, noted in a press release.

It is not yet clear if Li Li is pregnant but vets say hormone fluctuations and behavioural changes may give a clue by late June. “We hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year,” Boos said.

He said a panda cub would contribute to the conservation of a vulnerable species. Once the lockdown ends, such a popular draw could also rescue the tourist resort, which has recently reported financial difficulties.

The commercially-oriented park made no mention of the likelihood that the pandas were finally able to breed thanks to reduced stress from intrusive crowds. Instead it said the animals’ “success” was attributable to years of “trial and learning”, and the collaboration of experts from the Hong Kong park and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong.

Zoologists have long argued the panda’s reputation for a low sex drive was misleading because it was based solely on captive animals.

“The problems often attributed to them – short penises, narrow vaginas and low sex drives – are not an issue in the wild,” Jim Harkness, a panda expert and the former China representative for WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), said. “It is a phoney issue to say that pandas face a breeding crisis that we have to solve.”

He said the best way to protect the endangered species was to extend its habitat in the wild.";Hong Kong's pandas mate for first time in decade in privacy of coronavirus lockdown;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEAAqBh078GTkUE4w3NkxxxAqFwgEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTDZ4PsF?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edb817845a9aac8512a56f023dd5e57271b3052e/128_214_2532_1520/master/2532.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a1e7d54f5fcc7a1322150f9ff53e193c;2020-04-07;[{'sent': 'A middle-aged couple of giant pandas in a Hong Kong theme park have mated for the first time in more than 10 years, after finally enjoying a period of privacy thanks to the coronavirus lockdown.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong']}}, {'sent': 'Ying Ying and Le Le have been at Ocean Park since 2007 but, despite the encouragement of zookeepers, they had shown little inclination to have sex while daily hordes of visitors were watching their every move.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ying Ying']}}, {'sent': 'Chinese scientists, after losing patience with natural breeding, extracted sperm from Le Le and artificially inseminated Ying Ying, but this resulted in miscarriages.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ying Ying']}}, {'sent': 'Local reports say Ying Ying – in her oestrogen cycle – spent more time in the water and Le Le left more scent markings around the enclosure.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ying Ying'], 'GPE': ['Le Le']}}, {'sent': '“The successful natural mating process today is extremely exciting for all of us, as the chance of pregnancy via natural mating is higher than by artificial insemination,” Michael Boos, executive director for zoological operations and conservation at Ocean Park, noted in a press release.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Michael Boos']}}, {'sent': 'It is not yet clear if Li Li is pregnant but vets say hormone fluctuations and behavioural changes may give a clue by late June.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Li Li']}}, {'sent': '“We hope to bear wonderful pregnancy news to Hong Kongers this year,” Boos said.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Hong Kongers'], 'PERSON': ['Boos']}}, {'sent': 'Instead it said the animals’ “success” was attributable to years of “trial and learning”, and the collaboration of experts from the Hong Kong park and the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Hong Kong', 'Wolong'], 'ORG': ['the China Conservation and Research Center']}}, {'sent': '“The problems often attributed to them – short penises, narrow vaginas and low sex drives – are not an issue in the wild,” Jim Harkness, a panda expert and the former China representative for WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature), said.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Jim Harkness'], 'GPE': ['China'], 'ORG': ['World Wide Fund', 'WWF']}}];Positive;2020;4;2020;4;411539

It’s a moment of feline sympathy that launches the show and sends Goode on a five-year quest to document Big Tiger—a cat-sprayed industry of breeders, traffickers, and wealthy narcissists exhibiting wild animals across the United States. The bigger the ego, the bigger the cat.

Goode, a somewhat well-known conservationist and entrepreneur, should be a natural fit for this series: he founded the Turtle Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit, in addition to creating and designing several nightclubs and hotels, including the Bowery Hotel in New York City. Unfortunately, Goode brings to Tiger King the intellectual rigor and social responsibility of... a nightclub and hotel developer. Don’t get me wrong, Tiger King is as fun as shootin’ up a stop sign. But the scene with the leopard in the van is the only indication in the five-hour series that anyone behind the camera gives half a litter box about wildlife. Instead, it selectively leaves out information to craft a narrative that entertains at the expense of both the cats and the actual earthbound truth.

I’m not a big-cat person. My familiarity with this world comes from the several months I spent last year producing and editing a podcast series called Cat People with reporter Rachel Nuwer. In the series, we explore and try to explain America’s tiger problem, including two episodes that cover much of the same ground as Tiger King. And while Cat People is a work of journalism that goes in a very different direction with the material than the quarantine-fueled supernova of mass entertainment that is Tiger King, the docuseries skims over or entirely leaves out the context viewers need to understand anything tiger related.

Tiger King looks at three organizations, each with its own charismatic figurehead. Joe “Exotic” Maldonado-Passage runs the GW Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma, Bhagavan “Doc” Antle founded The Institute for Greatly Endangered and Rare Species (TIGER) in South Carolina, and Carole Baskin operates Big Cat Rescue in Florida. Tiger King would have you believe that all three facilities and their owners are versions of the same thing—egomaniacs who get off on owning wild animals and then selling that feeling of power and primal connection to the public. The show presents Joe Exotic as honest in his dishonesty, Doc Antle as a con man maintaining plausible deniability, and Carole Baskin as a hypocrite, having fooled her followers (and maybe herself) into believing that she’s somehow different than the other two. It glosses over the fact that her facility is, in most ways, fundamentally different.

You know why there are more tigers in captivity than in the wild? Because the general public will pay huge amounts of money to play with a tiny tiger cub for a few minutes. But tigers only stay tiny for a few weeks, so to maintain their supply, breeders like Joe Exotic and Doc Antle, as the series shows, churn out cubs for their petting operations and then unload them when the felines grow up, start chomping on customers, and develop a $10,000-a-year meat habit.

What Tiger King largely brushes aside is that Big Cat Rescue, on the other hand, only accepts animals confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who are trying to get rid of them. The series quickly skims over the fact that these cats are almost always adults and that the sanctuary forbids petting—if a staff member or volunteer touches an animal for any reason, they’re fired and never allowed to return. Finally, Big Cat Rescue will only take animals if the owners sign a contract declaring that they’ll never own, or even have a photo taken, with another big cat. If they violate the contract, there are financial penalties. The docuseries doesn’t mention this at all.

The Baskins aren’t just rescuing big cats, they’re also working on the problem at its source. The biggest threat to tigers’ survival around the world is habitat loss and poaching. When American diplomats try to push other countries to address their high levels of poaching, however, they’re basically laughed at and told to clean up their own problem first. The Baskins are trying to do exactly that. In 2003, they helped pass a bill making it illegal for owners and breeders to sell big cats as pets across state lines. Then, in 2016, they were part of a collection of environmental groups that convinced the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to close a loophole that allowed licensees like Joe Exotic and Doc Antle to sell big cats to each other. The Baskins’ latest lobbying effort is a bipartisan piece of legislation called the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which Tiger King briefly mentions before going back to more salacious material. It would ban all cub petting and exotic-animal encounters, including for hybrids like ligers and tiligers, effectively shutting down the mechanism that drives the tiger industry.

Instead of making this basic difference clear, the series paints Carole as greedy and manipulative, and it portrays her followers and contributors as having been suckered. Yes, she is uncomfortably cat obsessed. Yes, her organization’s music videos are pretty cringey. And it’s true that no one knows what happened to her second husband, Don Lewis, which Tiger King revels in for a whole episode. But it’s also true that all the fact-checked pieces of journalism about Carole Baskin (and quite a few have been published) end there—no one knows. Tiger King, on the other hand, gives a megaphone to the conjecture that Carole killed her husband and fed him to the tigers. The backlash to that conjecture? It defames her, of course, but it also limits her and her husband’s ability to do big-picture conservation work. It hurts the cats.

Let’s jump back to the breeders for a second, though, because that’s where Tiger King really drops the ball. The show gives voice to the idea that breeders are helping wildlife by increasing their numbers. “We’re makin’ more of ’em,” Joe says. This is one of the most common arguments you hear from tiger owners and breeders. It’s also intellectually dishonest, and the fact the series does not give anyone a chance to correct it in the documentary is irresponsible. Virtually all privately owned tigers in the U.S. are mutts who do not belong to any of the six distinct subspecies found in the wild and therefore are genetically useless to conservation efforts. The show lets Joe and others suggest that if it looks like a tiger, it must be a tiger, never bothering to point out that that’s not actually the case. Tony the Tiger would do better in the wild. At least he wouldn’t muddy wild genes.

These choices add up to a show that becomes propaganda for its own binge-worthy thesis: the whole industry is petty and shallow, to the point that none of these people who have devoted their lives to big cats actually care about animals. It’s good TV. It’s just not true.

Goode has stopped doing interviews about Tiger King, but he expressed some regret to Vanity Fair last month that the series wasn’t more focused on the animals. “Netflix is very adept at making binge-worthy television,” he said. Tiger King was supposed to be Blackfish for cats. Goode told his subjects he was making a film focused on environmental problems. He ended up with something that may actually be a step backward for tiger conservation in the United States.";'Tiger King' Is a Wild Ride.

One show, in particular, seems to have caught the nation’s fascination — “Tiger King.” Unfortunately, there is so much more to the story than what this sad reality show reveals.

After watching the first few episodes, it didn’t take long to understand why so many people were fascinated by the story of Joe Exotic, Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage, and others like him. For me, it was a display of blatant animal cruelty, substandard conditions, improper care and the often unpleasant personality traits of individuals involved in the exploitation of animals — and the exploitation of people.

On the surface, one might think hanging around exotic big cats is a dream come true. But for the animal victims in these lucrative businesses, their lives are far from a dream. The profits come from people paying top dollar to have their picture taken with a cub. But, cubs grow up — so to keep turning a profit, more cubs must be produced.

According to the Performing Animal Welfare Sanctuary in California:

• Cub petting operations must constantly breed their females. This “speed breeding” physically depletes the mothers, and cubs are often born sickly or dead.

• Cubs are ripped from their mothers shortly after birth, traumatizing both mother and cubs. The cubs are then hand-raised, depriving them of immune-boosting antibodies found in their mother’s milk and leaving them vulnerable to disease, including some that can be transmitted to adults and children who handle them.

• Once they grow big enough to be used for photos ops, cubs are subjected to hours of rough handling, denied sleep and often abused.

• After about eight to 12 weeks, the cubs can no longer be used, as they are more dangerous for the public to handle. They may be sold to other roadside zoos or private individuals, where conditions may be as bad or even worse, retained to breed more cubs, or, as “Tiger King” suggests, killed.

For many of us in the world of animal law enforcement, dealing with the captive wildlife trade and all the issues that go along with it can’t end soon enough. For decades, we’ve been trying to educate people, encourage enforcement in jurisdictions with little to no regulations on exotic animal ownership, and working hard to combat the breeding and resulting surplus of tigers in pseudo-sanctuaries, backyards and private breeders.

Reputable animal sanctuaries like PAWS and Big Cat Rescue only accept animals confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who are trying to get rid of them. The sanctuaries prohibit petting, and in the case of Big Cat Rescue, will only take animals if the owners sign a contract declaring that they’ll never own, or even have a photo taken with, another big cat.

It’s easy to breed tigers for profit, but it it’s harder to care for them in ways that help them thrive. Two national groups that ensure good care standards for exotic animals are the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries. If you come across a facility or individual promoting exotic animals, check to see if they are a member of either of these organizations before giving them your business or donations.

And, H.R. 1380, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, will provide a national framework to prevent many of the cruelties portrayed in “Tiger King.” Tigers, along with other exotic animals, belong in the wild and in properly accredited zoos and sanctuaries, not in the hands of individuals who exploit them.

While it’s unfortunate Netflix didn’t use this opportunity to expose the level of cruelty and inhumane treatment of these animals, I am heartened to see this is as starting point for conversations about how we treat wild animals and how we can work to end their exploitation.

The over-the-top, oddball cast of characters in Netflix’s popular ""Tiger King"" series have one thing in common: They all claim to love tigers . They even insist that through the ownership and operation of zoos and petting events, they raise public awareness about tigers and so, in turn, are helping endangered species.

But those who work on the front lines of tiger conservation strongly disagree.

Experts told Live Science that the roadside and private zoos of ""Tiger King,"" all of which are unaccredited and unregulated, hold no value for tiger conservation. Rather, the zoos contribute nothing to the preservation of tiger populations in the wild; they breed captive animals that are prone to genetic defects and health issues; and they may even increase the threats to wild tigers from poachers.

""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness"" debuted on Netflix on March 20, delivering an almost unbelievable seven-episode story of tiger ownership and public display alongside drug addiction, gun fetishizing, polygamy, vendettas, suicide and assassination-for-hire. In fact, the human drama in ""Tiger King"" is so outlandish that it upstages the tigers.

Well, almost.

Tigers (Panthera tigris), of which there are nine subspecies, once roamed forests and grasslands across Asia, from Turkey to Russia's eastern coast, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Only a century ago, there were approximately 100,000 tigers in the wild. Today, just 2,000 to 3,000 tigers exist in the wild: in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia and Thailand, where they occupy less than 6% of their former range, the IUCN says.

But the idea that this rare cat can be helped by captive-breeding as many of them as possible is a misconception, said Dale Miquelle, coordinator of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Tiger Program and director of the WCS Russia Program.

""The problem is not that tigers can't breed in the wild. They are perfectly capable if they are provided with the minimum needs for survival — sufficient space, sufficient prey and protection from poaching,"" Miquelle told Live Science in an email.

Regulated breeding by reputable zoos can produce captive populations that may be suitable for reintroducing into the wild in areas where tigers have already vanished. However, as long as human activities continue to drive tigers to extinction in their native habitats, breeding more tigers won't help the species unless those ongoing threats are addressed, Miquelle said.

Regulated breeding

An estimated 5,000 tigers live in zoos or private collections in the U.S. alone. But just 6% of those tigers inhabit facilities that are accredited members of organizations such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Such zoos strictly monitor animal breeding, and have fundraising and public education programs that support tiger research and conservation, Leigh Henry, director of Wildlife Policy at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), told Live Science in an email.

About 230 zoological parks and aquariums are AZA-accredited; together, they care for more than 800,000 animals and support hundreds of projects worldwide to conserve vulnerable species and habitats, according to the organization's website .

AZA zoos participate in the Species Survival Plan (SSP), ""which strives to maintain captive populations that could be used for reintroduction should a species go extinct in the wild,"" said John Goodrich, chief scientist and director of the Tiger Program for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization. This guideline ensures that subspecies are separated, and that closely related tigers aren’t interbred — both criteria help to produce healthy, genetically diverse animals that could survive in the wild.

""This SSP strictly controls the captive breeding of species like tigers to ensure their genetic integrity and to ensure that the scale of breeding does not exceed that needed to meet the conservation goal,"" Goodrich told Live Science in an email. ""This stands in stark contrast to petting zoos like those featured in 'Tiger King.'"" (One zoo in the show is an exception: Big Cat Rescue, a nonprofit sanctuary in Tampa, Florida, which houses rescued animals and does not breed tigers or offer cubs for petting.)

Some of the ""Tiger King"" cats are not even true tigers, but rather ""human-created oddities"" — hybrids such as ""ligers,"" the offspring of lions and tigers, or white tigers, which are also bred through artificial selection, Miquelle said. And zoos that offer cub petting and photos require a steady supply of very young cubs, since they become too dangerous to handle once they reach a few months of age. Constant breeding with no oversight results in animals of uncertain lineage that can't be released in the wild, suffer from health issues and genetic defects, and so are of no value to tiger conservation, according to Miquelle.

An indirect threat

Roadside zoos and the thousands of tigers they keep may even indirectly increase poaching of wild tigers for body parts that are sold in illegal wildlife markets, said Henry. Because tiger ownership in the U.S. isn't strongly regulated, no central agency tracks who owns tigers, where they keep the cats, when tigers are traded or sold, ""or what happens to their valuable parts when they die,"" Henry explained.

This means that when captive tigers in the U.S. die, their body parts could be funneled into the international illegal trade pipeline, perpetuating the demand for tiger parts for traditional medicines and folk remedies. That, in turn, could encourage more poaching in countries where tigers live, endangering wild populations, Henry said.

With the runaway popularity of ""Tiger King,"" — it was seen by 34.3 million people in the U.S. in its first 10 days — tigers are basking in the public spotlight. But viewers who are newly intrigued by the endangered cats and want to help them should do so by supporting legitimate zoos and conservation organizations that are fighting to protect tigers in their natural habitats and to pass legislation that will end the illegal wildlife trade and regulate tiger ownership, Goodrich told Live Science.

""Given adequate protections, wild tiger numbers will continue to increase across their natural range — but conservation efforts need to be focused on recovering these wild populations,"" he said.";Outrageous 'Tiger King' zoo owners say they help tigers.

Longleat Safari Park released candid photos of their lions, tigers and wolves showing visitors what they're missing during the lockdown.

Big cat keeper Caleb Hall used the time the park was closed to pictures of the Wiltshire park's famous lions as well as their two colonies of tigers and wolf pack.

The Amur tiger cubs Rusty and Yuki, who were born in July last year, were captured playfighting, resting and hanging out with their four-year-old mother Yana.

The lions were the first animals to arrive. They have two prides of lions on the estate who live in separate enclosures.

The easiest of their lions to spot are called Harry, Claus and Simba.

It closed to the public from March 27 due to the coronavirus outbreak but they offer a 'virtual safari' which people can watch from home.

The last time the park had to close to the public was during foot and mouth restrictions in 2001.

Editor’s note: Netflix’s new docuseries “Tiger King” takes viewers into the strange world of big cat collectors. Featuring eccentric characters with names like Joe Exotic and Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, the series touches on polygamy, addiction, and personality cults while exploring a mysterious disappearance and a murder-for-hire.

To Allison Skidmore, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies wildlife trafficking, the documentary didn’t bring enough attention to the scourge of captive big cats.

A former park ranger, Skidmore first started studying the issue in the U.S. after the infamous death of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe in 2015. She was shocked to learn about how little oversight there was stateside. We asked her about the legality, incentives, and ease of buying and selling tigers.

1. How many captive tigers are in the U.S.?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer. The vast majority of captive tigers are crossbred hybrids, so they aren’t identified as members of one of the six tiger subspecies – the Bengal tiger, Amur tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, and Malayan tiger. Instead, they’re classified as “generic.”

Less than 5 percent – or fewer than 350 – of tigers in captivity are managed through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a nonprofit organization that serves as an accrediting body in the U.S. They ensure accredited facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by law.

All the rest are privately owned tigers, meaning they don’t belong to one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ 236 sponsored institutions. These are considered generic and fall outside of federal oversight.

There’s no legal requirement to register these generic tigers, nor a comprehensive national database to track and monitor them. The best educated guess puts the number of tigers at around 10,000 in the U.S. Estimates put the global captive tiger population as high as 25,000.

In comparison, there are fewer than 4,000 tigers in the wild – down from 100,000 a century ago.

2. How do tigers change hands?

The Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna prevent the importation of tigers from the wild. So all tigers in the U.S. are born in captivity, with the rare exception of an orphaned wild cub that may end up in a zoo.

Only purebred tigers that are one of the six definitive subspecies are accounted for; these are the tigers you see in places like the Smithsonian National Zoo and generally belong to the Species Survival Plan, a captive breeding program designed to regulate the exchange of specific endangered species between member zoos in order to maintain genetic diversity.

All other tigers are found in zoos, sanctuaries, carnivals, wildlife parks, exhibits, and private homes that aren’t sanctioned by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They can change hands in any number of ways, from online marketplaces to exotic animal auctions. They can be bought for as little as $800 to $2,000 for a cub and $200 to $500 for an adult, which is less expensive than many purebred dog puppies.

3. Can I legally buy a tiger?

The U.S. is plagued with complicated and vague laws concerning tiger ownership.

However, there are no federal statutes or regulations that expressly forbid private ownership of tigers. State and local jurisdictions have been given this authority, and some do pass bans or require permits. 32 states have bans or partial bans, and 14 states allow ownership with a simple license or permit. Four states – Alabama, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Nevada – have no form of oversight or regulation at all.

An overarching, cohesive framework of regulations is missing, and even in states that ban private ownership, there are loopholes. For example, in all but three states, owners can apply for what’s called a “federal exhibitor license,” which is remarkably cheap and easy to obtain and circumvents any stricter state or local laws in place.

You now need a permit to transport tigers across state lines, but there’s still no permit required for intra-state travel.

4. What’s in it for the owners?

Some see it as a business venture, while others claim they care about conservation. I consider the latter reason insincere.

Many facilities promote themselves as wildlife refuges or sanctuaries. These places frame their breeding and exhibition practices as stewardship, as if they’re contributing to an endangered animal’s survival. The reality is that no captive tiger has ever been released into the wild, so it’s not like these facilities can augment wild populations. A true sanctuary or refuge should have a strict no breeding or handling policy and should have education programs dedicated to promoting conservation.

Ultimately, tigers are big money makers, especially tiger cubs. The Animal Welfare Act allows cub petting from eight to 12 weeks of age. People pay $100 to $700 to pet, bottle-feed, swim with, or take a photo with a cub.

None of these profits go toward the conservation of wild tigers, and this small window of opportunity for direct public contact means that exhibitors must continually breed tigers to maintain a constant supply of cubs.

The value of cubs declines significantly after 12 weeks. Where do all these surplus tigers go? Unfortunately, due to a lack of regulatory oversight, it’s hard to know.

Since many states don’t account for their live tigers, there’s also no oversight regarding the reporting and disposal of dead tigers. Wildlife criminologists fear that these tigers can easily end up in the black market where their parts can cumulatively be worth up to $70,000. There’s evidence of U.S. captive tigers tied to the domestic black market trade; in 2003, an owner of a tiger “rescue” facility was found to have 90 dead tigers in freezers on his property. And in 2001, an undercover investigation led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ended up leading to the prosecutions of 16 people for buying, selling, and slaughtering 19 tigers.

5. What role does social media play?

Posing with tigers on social media platforms like Instagram and on dating apps has become a huge problem. Not only can it create a health and safety risk for both the human and tiger, but it also fosters a false narrative.

If you see thousands of photos of people with captive tigers, it masks the true problem of endangered tigers in the wild. Some might wonder whether tigers are really so endangered if they’re so easy to pose with.

The reality of the wild tiger’s plight has become masked behind the pomp and pageantry of social media. This marginalizes meaningful ideas about conservation and the true status of tigers as one of the most endangered big cats.

It's hard to avoid the buzz around Netflix's hit ""Tiger King"" docuseries at the moment, but two wildlife professionals say viewers are taking the wrong messages away from the show.

Officially titled ""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,"" the Netflix documentary chronicles the escalating conflict between big cat breeders operating private zoos and animal rights activists, and the story ultimately spirals into an alleged murder-for-hire plot, as Insider's Margot Harris reported.

Insider's Jason Guerrasio added: ""But what makes this seven-episode docuseries something you can't turn away from is the flamboyant character called Joe Exotic. And that's saying really something because some of the other characters in the series include a conservation owner who is accused of running a cult, another who is a former cocaine drug lord, and a woman rescuer who is accused of murdering her first husband and feeding him to her exotic wild cats.""

Since the show was released, social media has been filled with Joe Exotic memes, tiger-related TikToks, and a conspiracy theory suggesting character Carole Baskin killed her husband, Don Lewis, then fed his body to the big cats in her sanctuary.

While the general public is understandably obsessed with a cast of characters weirder than any even Hollywood's finest could dream up, experts say Exotic's biggest victims, the tigers, get lost in all the crazy interpersonal drama.

Animals rights issues are a backdrop to the show's wild characters

Ellie Armstrong, science advisor for the nonprofit Tigers in America and a PhD candidate at Stanford University, told Insider that wildlife professionals in the US knew a documentary about the domestic tiger trade was in the works, but were horrified when they finally saw ""Tiger King.""

""The last I'd heard, it wasn't happening,"" she said. ""I guess things changed when Joe got arrested, and the producers decided to make a reality show instead of a documentary.""

She said they had known tiger breeding and trafficking was a problem overseas, but didn't realize the extent to which it was happening in the US.

Conservation biologist Imogene Cancellare, meanwhile, has spent years studying big cats, including working for an accredited wildlife sanctuary, Carolina Tiger Rescue, and researching the genetic connectivity of wild snow leopards across Central Asia.

Currently a PhD candidate in the Rare and Elusive Species Lab at the University of Delaware, she loathed the Netflix show, accusing the producers of relegating the tigers to ""background noise"" for most of the episodes.

""Conversations have been about the larger-than-life people rather than the plight of private exotic animal ownership and what it means for the animals,"" she told Insider. ""Producers played up the conspiracies with Baskin, but failed to distinguish her real — and much needed — efforts in combating animal abuse.""

For much of the series, Exotic is presented as a goofy anti-hero, despite being seen stealing a just-born tiger cub from its helpless mother who is still in labor.

The series also suggests he ""killed tigers, sold others in the middle of the night, and tried to hire someone to kill another person,"" as Cancellare puts it, but still: ""For too many people, the takeaway is 'Carole Baskin's a bitch.' It's wild misogyny.""

When directors Eric Goode and Rebecca Chaiklin spoke to Vanity Fair about how the series came about, Goode, himself a conservationist, admitted the personalities in the show ""did trump the issue of the ethic-acy of keeping these animals in captivity, and especially the way these people were using these animals — exploiting them for profit.""

He added: ""Personally, I had originally set out to do a slightly different story.""

He later clarified his statement, saying: ""I went into this to explore a different side of the animal world in terms of wild animals in captivity. After spending years with these subjects the project moved in a different direction.

""Netflix is very adept at making binge-worthy television and with these larger-than-life subjects that was pretty easy to do. However, my goal is and has always been the same, which is to raise awareness and help save the species.""

What goes on behind the scenes at private zoos

When the baby tigers were brought out at Joe's zoo, hearts melted. But most of the visitors who pay for a similar experience, or witness it on TV, don't realize what likely went on behind the scenes, according to Armstrong.

""Tiger cubs separated from their mother aren't pleasant, snuggly little creatures,"" Armstrong said. ""They're screaming, biting, scratching, and difficult to handle.

""A big part of getting a cub ready for one of these pay-to-pet operations is making it submissive, and you can imagine what that entails. They're dangerous at a very young age, and their claws and teeth very sharp. Exhibitors will often declaw the cubs and even file down their teeth to make them safe for visitors.""

Ellie Armstrong in the field. Ellie Armstrong

Declawing may seem like a relatively harmless procedure, but there's a reason why most veterinarians refuse to declaw domestic house cats today — it actually involves amputating the last digits of their paws, Armstrong said, and many of the cats never fully recover.

Meanwhile, teeth filing at the roadside zoos has become so pervasive that there's a whole foundation, the Peter Emily Foundation, dedicated to repairing sanctuary cats' teeth.

Cancellare told Insider that instead of getting around-the-clock care from their mothers, these tiger cubs suffer from a host of maladies, including chronic exhaustion, stress diarrhea, and malnourishment.

Baby tigers have a relatively short window where they're small enough to be safely handled, so pay-to-pet operators like Exotic and Doc Antle, another zoo owner from the series, need to constantly replenish their supply of cubs by breeding. After the cubs outlive their usefulness, they're often either sold or killed, Armstrong said.

Not only do the tiger cubs suffer, but so do their mothers. After her cubs are ripped away from her, the mother immediately goes back into heat, Armstrong said. They become like breeding factories, producing three litters and up to 12 cubs each year, before eventually dying prematurely.

Tigers in roadside zoos and private collections often die of neglect or untreated curable illnesses, while others are killed outright because of the need for space, according to Armstrong. Some are even sold to taxidermists or into the parts trade.

For operations that have been breeding and selling for 20 years, Armstrong estimates the number of tigers killed ""could easily be in the thousands.""

Tilting the 'Tiger King' spotlight

Cancellare was reluctant to comment on the particular motivations of the ""Tiger King"" cast, but lamented that most private owners seem to view tigers as commodities instead of the regal animals they are.

""Because it's so easy to acquire a tiger, it's easy for people to collect and treat them as livestock for personal gain under the guise of conservation efforts,"" Cancellare said.

While the docuseries itself may not have delved too deeply into the abuse the tigers endure, it has sparked conversation amongst concerned wildlife professionals on social media and elsewhere.

Cancellare herself did a deep dive on the problems presented in the show on Twitter shortly after the series premiered.

""You can tell from the way people often pose with wild animals they're not realizing the implications of their actions,"" Armstrong told Insider.

""We believe discussions like this will help to raise awareness and at some point, people will stop patronizing roadside zoos and faux sanctuaries.""

What viewers can do to help

Instead of visiting unaccredited roadside zoos, Armstrong asks people to visit true sanctuaries, like PAWS in California, Indiana's Exotic Feline Rescue Center, or In-Sync Exotics in Texas, though a more thorough list can be found at tigersinamerica.org.

She also recommends donating to Tigers in America's Rescue Fund or another sanctuary and advocate for the Big Cat Public Safety Act (HR 1380).

Legitimate zoos and sanctuaries often support research efforts for wild tigers as well.

""Asking your accredited zoo or sanctuary what projects they support can be a good way to learn how you can support wild cats,"" Cancellare said. ""Non-profits like Panthera are collaborating with scientists worldwide to address the conservation threats to tigers in the wild. Support of their work, either through boosting them on social media or donating directly, ensures that conservationists can thoroughly address conservation concerns.""

Rumours are already circling around a potential follow-ups to ""Tiger King"" — including a movie starring Kate McKinnon as Baskin — but not surprisingly, both Cancellare and Armstrong have their reservations.

""I think the filmmakers have already shown us that they're not responsible storytellers,"" Armstrong said. ""We could use a real documentary, say a 'Blackfish' about big cats, and not a 'Swamp People' with tigers reality show.

""The fact that Joe killed at least five of his healthy tigers because he needed more cage space, but is still portrayed as someone who deserves our sympathy, did their viewers a serious disservice.""

Although the world-famous wildlife park is closed to visitors Mr Hall wanted to show people that life for the animals is continuing as normal.

As well as shots of the park’s resident pack of European wolves, he also captured dramatic images of one of Longleat’s iconic lions along with a series of photographs of Amur tiger cubs Rusty and Yuki playfighting, resting and hanging out with mum Yana.

Native to the far east of Russia, the Amur tiger is the largest of the big cats and can weigh up to 300 kg and measure more than three metres in length.

In the 1930s the tigers had nearly died out due to hunting and logging. At one stage it is thought the population fell as low as just 20–30 animals.

Although they are still under severe threat their status was officially changed from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007.

“Despite all the dramatic changes taking place across the country, the animals here in the park are pretty much carrying on as if nothing has happened,” said Mr Hall.

“I wanted to give the tens of thousands of people who would normally be visiting at this time of the year a bit of an update and also provide them with some images they can share and enjoy.

“We are all hoping it won’t be too long before we welcome the public back but, until then, I plan to be regularly uploading new images online and sharing them on our various digital platforms,” he added.

Longleat opened the first drive-through safari park outside of Africa back in 1966 and has been welcoming millions of visitors through its gates ever since.

I am referring to “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” a documentary about a roadside zookeeper in Oklahoma named Joe Exotic, a.k.a Joe Maldonado-Passage a.k.a Joe Schreibvogel. He ran one of the largest tiger breeding and cub-petting operations in the country.

Joe Exotic is serving a 22-year sentence for wildlife crimes and a murder-for-hire plot to kill an animal rights activist. He is the Charles Manson of animal cruelty.

Animals in cages are vulnerable and helpless. According to a lawyer for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, who testified at his trial, Joe Exotic shot five of his tigers in the head to free up space to board tigers for money and sold baby tigers to persons who he knew would crush their skulls with a hammer. He ripped months-old baby tiger cubs away from their mothers and declawed them, which is akin to cutting off a person’s fingers. It can cause lameness, psychological distress and even death to the animals.

Sure, Joe Exotic was exotic. He was a gay man in Oklahoma who had two-tone hair and a pistol and wore sequins; at one point, he had two husbands. Yes, we are all getting a little crazy in self-isolation, which is why the insanity of “Tiger King” may have been so appealing. And the people behind “Tiger King” appeared more interested in showing us Joe’s colorful life than what he did to his animals. The directors barely interviewed wildlife experts, who would have wiped away Joe’s appeal if allowed to describe his cruelty in detail in “Tiger King.”

All that still does not excuse rapper Cardi B’s tweet that, despite his proven crimes, she was going to start a GoFundMe for Joe. “He shall be free,” she wrote. (Now she says she was only fooling.) It doesn’t excuse actor Jared Leto posting a picture on Instagram of himself in a Joe Exotic costume; or Sylvester Stallone and his family dressing up as the cast of “Tiger King”; or an endless number of actors posing as Joe Exotic in publicly posted photos meant to land them a role in a movie version; or the fans who approached Joe’s staff members, even in a pandemic, to shake their hands and take pictures.

Many of Joe’s staff, according to an investigation by the Humane Society of the United States, abused, hit and mishandled animals. Yet the “bonus” episode of “Tiger King” was largely devoted to Joe’s business associates and employees. With smiles on their faces, they described how they have become celebrities and which actors should play them in a movie about Joe Exotic.

The Joe Exotic adulation will only encourage people to patronize private zoos like Joe’s. It certainly makes it easier for Joe Exotic to do his time because, according to “Tiger King’s” director, even in prison Joe’s fame has made him “happier than he has ever been.”

Joe Exotic and his accomplices deserve only revulsion and condemnation. A well-documented link exists between animal abuse, interpersonal violence and other serious crimes. As one study found, “indicators of animal abuse are remarkably similar to those of child abuse.” Forty-three percent of school shooters have abused animals. Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer impaled frogs, cats and dogs’ heads on sticks.

If any good is to come out of “Tiger King,” Congress must finally pass the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would go a long way to stopping the mistreatment of the thousands of privately owned big cats in the United States. Such a law would have prevented the owner of “Tony the Tiger” to keep a Bengal-Siberian tiger in a cage at a Louisiana road-side gas station named the Tiger Truck Stop.

When animal activists tried to stop the sickening spectacle, Joe Exotic rallied support for the tiger’s owner. Before it was finally euthanized because of health problems, the tiger had spent its life in that cage.

No one should be entertained by any of this.

The outcome is the result of a decade-long program to protect tigers in this area.

Researchers deployed an unconventional survey design for this study, investigating the reliability of previous methods of estimating wildlife populations.

Camera traps in eastern Thailand’s Dong Phayayen-Khao Yai (DPKY) forest complex have yielded photos of tiger cubs, providing long-awaited evidence that the big cat is breeding in this part of Southeast Asia.

Conservationists conducted the camera-trap survey in the Thap Lan-Pang Sida Tiger Conservation Landscape (TCL) of DPKY, where recent reports suggest a small, but vital, population of tigers (Panthera tigris) occurs. (There’s currently debate about whether Indochinese tigers constitute their own subspecies, P. t. corbetti, or are simply a population of mainland Asian tigers, P. t. tigris, that also include the larger Bengal and Siberian tigers.)

“Efforts to improve anti-poaching patrols and law enforcement efforts are critical to providing a safe area for tigers to breed,” said Supagit Vinitpornsawan, the former head of the DPKY Wildlife Research Station. “Recent results of our monitoring indicate these efforts may be paying off.”

Published in the journal Biological Conservation, the new scientific survey shows a glimmer of hope for a decade-old program known as the DPKY Tiger Recovery Project. Conservationists say they may even be on track to meet a goal of increasing Thailand’s tiger numbers by 50% by 2026. It may be that Thailand’s tigers can avoid the fate of those in other countries.

Currently, conservationists believe only 221 Indochinese tigers remain in two Asian countries, Thailand and Myanmar, after a camera trap study in 2019 revealed the last remaining populations in Laos had vanished. Populations in Vietnam and Cambodia are also believed to be locally extinct.

But the DPKY population has room to grow. The estimated population for the study area is around 20 individuals, with a minimum of 14 and a maximum of 33 tigers. The researchers estimate the population density is only 0.63 tigers per 100 square kilometers (39 square miles) — a much lower density than other habitats in the tiger’s current range. For example, in Huai Kha Khaeng, in Thailand’s Western Forest Complex (WEFCOM), a previous study estimated a density ranging from 1.27 to 2.09 tigers per 100 km2 from 2005 to 2012. Still, differences in study design make exact comparisons difficult.

Categorized as endangered on the IUCN Red List, Thailand’s tigers are imperiled by poaching for tiger parts, poaching of their prey, and illegal rosewood logging. All these threats are present in the forest complex where they reside.

“If we fail to contain [the illegal wildlife trade] it is likely we will see the extinction of the species in the wild in the not too distant future,” said Chris Hallam, a conservation scientist in charge of monitoring and operations for Panthera USA. Panthera, a global wild cat conservation organization, collaborated on the survey with Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP), the Freeland Foundation, and Oxford University’s Wildlife Conservation Research Unit (WildCRU).

Tiger numbers in the wild have dropped from 100,000 a century ago to around 3,900 today, most of which survive in India. There are more captive tigers in the U.S. than there are wild ones worldwide.

For this study, the researchers used spatially explicitly capture-recapture (SECR) sampling, a popular method of population estimation. However, with so few tigers out there, reliable results were difficult, and, in the end, they found non-regular survey designs more beneficial.

“In our study, we utilized computer simulations to investigate and evaluate how different camera-trap placements and survey duration effect population estimates,” said Eric Ash, lead author of the study and a researcher with WildCRU.

The paper questions previous methods of estimating wildlife populations, a potentially valuable step toward improving our understanding of tiger distribution across their range.

To avoid extirpations similar to those in Laos and Cambodia, “monitoring is critical for managers to evaluate populations over time and determine the efficacy of conservation actions. It can also determine areas of conservation priority in which protection efforts can be focused,” Ash said.

But even remote monitoring with camera traps can lead to harrowing moments. Hallam says his biggest thrill during the camera trapping was “coming across a fresh urine spray from a tiger while putting out cameras.”

He added, “With such thick habitat and low densities, seeing tigers is difficult in the DPKY, but knowing I was mere seconds from one was both terrifying, exhilarating and humbling all at once.”

There are at least 1,600 captive tigers in Europe, compared to just 3,900 wild globally, says the global animal welfare organisation, FOUR PAWS.

FOUR PAWS state that tigers and cubs are being used as photo props and for selfies at facilities in countries including France, Germany, Spain and Malta.

""We know of one place where it is €50 for 10 minutes with a big cat cub,"" said Kieran Harkin, Head of Wildlife Animals in Trade at FOUR PAWS International.

It is estimated that many tigers eventually “lose their commercial value” and their body parts are sold for use in “traditional medicine” in Asian markets like China and Vietnam.

Previous data from 2018 had officially documented only 698 captive tigers in Europe, according to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

The new report comes just one month after a controversial Netflix true crime documentary ‘Tiger King’ exposed the breeding and trade of tigers in the United States.

FOUR PAWS told Euronews their concern that the demand for breeding cubs could result in a ""never-ending cycle"".

Horror stories of tigers being driven ""in the back of cars""

The private ownership of exotic pets, and the use of tigers in circuses is still legal in a number of EU countries, but FOUR PAWS says the trade is “poorly regulated and monitored” and many animals are suffering abuse in terrible conditions.

""Its quite easy for anyone to source and purchase a tiger in countries where private keeping is still legal,"" Kieran Harkin told Euronews.

""You only need to show enclosures and some authorities are not qualified enough to check if these enclosures are adequate enough for a tiger’s welfare"".

While owners usually have to apply for import and export permits, but Kieran Harkin says the European Union offers an exemption to this across borders.

""There are very few checks and we have heard all sorts of horror stories of people driving tigers and other big cat species in the back of cars"".

Most European countries also require prospective owners to have a licence for keeping a dangerous animal, but Harkin says the application and issuing of these licenses is ""also quite an easy process"".

FOUR PAWS also told Euronews that the sale of tigers for commercial gain can be a ""highly lucrative industry"".

A live tiger captive-bred in Europe can reportedly be worth up to €22,000, while a kilo of tiger bones could be valued at €1,700.

Which European countries have the most captive tigers?

CITES prohibits the commercial trade of wild tigers, and aims to ensure that any legal trade of tigers and parts has no impact on the survival of the species. But captive tigers are listed under a separate CITES Appendix, which does allow for their legal trade.

The Czech Republic and Germany have reported the highest figures of captive tigers in Europe, with 180 and 164 respectively.

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom, where the private keeping of captive tigers is legal, is third in the continent with 123 recorded animals.

Slovakia also reported 119 captive tigers, despite CITES recording just 3 in the EU country in 2018.

Just 17 of the 36 European countries contacted by FOUR PAWS, including only 12 EU member states, responded with figures.

NGOs estimate that Italy, one of those countries which did not respond, has 400 tigers kept in zoos, private homes and circuses.

FOUR PAWS says that many captive animals cannot be rehabilitated into the wild, while their illegal trade also fuels the demand for worldwide poaching of wild tigers.

""There will always be a higher onus on a wild tiger than a captive tiger, so by stimulating a greater demand for captive tigers, you’re actually placing more threat on wild populations,"" said Harkin.

""More efforts are needed,"" admits the EU as further measures considered

FOUR PAWS has urgently called on the European Union to ""suspend the export and re-export of live tigers and tiger parts"", except to legitimate sanctuaries.

The animal welfare organisation has further recommended that the EU introduces a comprehensive ban on commercial tiger trade to combat animal abuse.

""We need the EU to turn off the tap and stop this influx of tigers, and stop this breeding and distribution of tigers for different reasons, for circuses, for private keeping, and for petting across Europe,"" Harkin told Euronews.

""If we stop the commercial trade, and the only tigers that we see or are being bred across Europe have a legitimate conservation process, then that’s the ideal situation"".

""We do not need to be petting tigers, breeding hybrids and all this other entertainment"".

FOUR PAWS has previously launched projects focusing on the suffering of animals which are kept in inappropriate conditions, as well as in disaster and conflict zones.

The European Commission adopted an Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking in February 2016 to improve efforts against wildlife crime in the EU.

But despite encouraging signs, the Commission has said that “more efforts are needed” to combat the illegal trade of exotic animals.

“Wildlife trafficking continues to pose a serious threat to biodiversity, the rule of law and sustainable development, said Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, in 2018.

“We need to further intensify our efforts to reach the objectives of the Action Plan by 2020, and meet the target of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”.

""The European Union have been very good, working in other areas of the world when it comes to illegal wildlife trade,"" said Harkin, ""but it needs to look internally at its own jurisdictions"".

""We need a greater political appetite to do more and greater enforcement in Europe"".

Progress on the European Commission action plan is due to be assessed later this year. In a further statement to Euronews, a Commission source agreed that tigers need to be strictly protected.

""The Commission has therefore closely followed the recent cases of illegal trade in tigers in several EU Member States, and facilitated the exchange of relevant information among enforcement authorities through its expert group on wildlife trade enforcement.""

The EU say that, while there is no central register of tigers kept in the EU, authorities with member states have the responsibility and capability to control the keeping and breeding of tigers.

""The Commission has intensified its cooperation with the relevant enforcement authorities of the Member States and has asked them to pay special attention to these issues.""

""[We] will continue to monitor the situation, together with the CITES authorities of EU Member States and will consider whether further measures at EU level are needed.""

FOUR PAWS says they are also reaching out to members of the public to not take part in private interactions with big cats and recognise that ""these are not acceptable places in the modern world"".

‘If it is your dream wildlife or to interact with wildlife, do it in the wild - it does not compare with seeing a big cat in a sad state in a cage,"" Kieran Harkin told Euronews.

“We had trucks come in with only 15 percent of what they would normally have,” said Pat Craig, who founded the sanctuary in 1980 and made it into one of the world’s largest nonprofit exotic animal refuges.

“We had to buy food to make sure we didn’t deplete our reserves,” he added. “We already spent quite a bit of money — $200,000, maybe more.”

The unplanned outlay replaced meat, fruit and vegetable donations from big box stores, which plummeted 80 percent in March. It coincided with the disappearance of income typically generated by tens of thousands of visitors each year. The sanctuary is closed because of stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the virus.

Some 550 critters — including lions, grizzlies, wolves and bald eagles — reside at the facility about 36 miles northeast of Denver and at a second 9,684-acre location in southern Colorado. Feeding them is no small task.

The animals consume as much as a small city — up to 80,000 pounds of food a week, including roasts, raw eggs, blueberries and cucumbers. The facility relies on $700,000 in donated groceries a month to feed its charges, Craig said.

Helping to fill the gap, Cisco recently dropped off a tractor-trailer load of fruits and vegetables, Craig said, adding that he is working with meat suppliers to procure chicken and beef. As supply chains correct somewhat, Craig said he anticipates that big-box food contributions will bounce back in April to 75 percent of normal. But that level is still untenable for the sanctuary’s tight budget.

“Being down 25 percent could still cost millions of dollars, depending on how long it lasts,” said Craig, who opened the sanctuary when he was 19, starting out with a few acres on his family’s farm.

Meanwhile, he continues to find space for animals, many of whom are former residents of the nation’s loosely regulated system of small and private zoos. The sanctuary took in a record 204 creatures in 2019, including 10 bears and three hyenas from a shuttered wildlife center in California, 13 bears from two Argentine zoos, and two lions, two Asian black bears and three tigers from a zoo in Virginia.

In November 2017, Craig worked with the PETA Foundation to relocate 19 tigers from the facility featured in “Tiger King” to his Colorado refuge. The cats had been shipped to Oklahoma — in a cattle truck in the middle of summer — by a Florida zoo in violation of a court order.

“Myself and several colleagues, and Pat and his team, arrived at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park with armed security based on threats of violence Joe [Maldonado-Passage] made against PETA and the Wild Animal Sanctuary in the past,” said Brittany Peet, PETA’s director of captive animal law enforcement.

Craig said he returned to Oklahoma the following month at Maldonado-Passage’s request to take an additional 20 cats and three black bears. The rest of the animals at the zoo — which housed as many as 200 tigers at a time, Maldonado-Passage has boasted — remained in the custody of its new owner. Maldonado-Passage is now serving a 22-year federal prison sentence for murder-for-hire and wildlife violations, including the killing of five tigers.

But the tigers’ plight is only touched on in “Tiger King,” which focuses mostly on the bizarre battle between Maldonado-Passage and his nemesis, animal rights activist and big cat sanctuary owner Carole Baskin.

“With its mullets, maulings and murder-for-hire intrigue, Tiger King and Joe Exotic have taken the streaming world by storm,” Nielsen Media Research said in a statement, estimating that more than 34 million U.S. viewers watched the series in the 10 days following its release. “The real-life documentary featuring big cats and even larger personalities seemed to give covid-confined consumers a way to escape from an even more real news cycle.”

Craig, other sanctuary owners and conservationists say they hope to steer the conversation away from the show’s histrionic humans to the tigers taken from their mothers when just hours or days old and offered to the public as playthings at private zoos and public events.

“Our sanctuary members who have big cats feel that the show did not go deep enough into the cruelty involved in the process of breeding, exhibiting, selling, trading and buying of big cats and the dismal lives they endure and what people can do about stopping it,” Vernon Weir, director of the American Sanctuary Association, which represents more than 40 members, including Craig’s refuge, wrote in an email.

Animal protection advocates support a bipartisan bill that would outlaw most private ownership of big cats and ban public contact with such animals, a practice they say that incentivizes the sort of intensive breeding Maldonado-Passage engaged in — and mass dumping when the animals get too large for petting.

Known as the Big Cat Public Safety Act, it has languished in Congress in previous sessions. But the directors of “Tiger King” say the series is generating momentum for the bill, which they support, and some lawmakers have echoed that.

The PETA Foundation said it scored a victory for big cats when a federal court ruled this year that prematurely separating tiger cubs from their mothers and forcing them to play with the public violates the Endangered Species Act.

Peet said her organization hopes to use that precedent to shut down the big cat-petting business. It’s an effort she hopes will give Craig’s ever-expanding Colorado refuge some breathing room.

“I’ve worked with the Wild Animal Sanctuary to rescue dozens of big cats and bears,” Peet said. “I could literally call Pat right now and if I told him I had animals in need of rescuing he would be on the road in an hour.”

Like the tigers in Mersing and Dungun (see story here), the animal had – as recounted by Goodrich to National Geographic – “just walked into town and sat down”.

“I am aware of both cases in Malaysia and agree that it raises concerns for tiger health, ” says Dr Goodrich via email.

He was working with the Wildlife Conservation Society in 2003. Today, he is chief scientist and tiger programme director at conservation organisation Panthera and acknowledged as one of the world’s preeminent tiger biologists. He also serves in the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Cat Specialist Group.

Researchers estimated that at least 1% of the Siberian tiger population – numbering between 250 and 400 at the time – died of CDV between 2009 and 2013.

Dr Goodrich says no attempt was made to contain the disease at that time. “That is, it was allowed to run its course. There was no vaccination campaign for dogs, ” he says, replying to our question about whether Russian scientists embarked on a dog vaccination programme to help curb the disease.

While he believes that vaccinating dogs against infectious diseases is “always a good idea” because it promotes the health of domestic animals and can reduce the transmission of diseases among domestic and wild animals and humans, it is “not necessarily the best use of conservation funds for tigers as an emergency measure”.

“That is because while dogs may transmit canine distemper to tigers, there are many, many species of wild carnivores that are susceptible to and can act as reservoirs of canine distemper, ” he points out.

And in Russia, Dr Goodrich further elaborates, the CDV is likely endemic in a variety of wild carnivores, such as foxes and raccoon dogs, that serve as reservoirs for the disease. As tigers regularly interact with these smaller carnivores, often killing them for food, they can be exposed to the virus.

“Vaccinating domestic dogs may not have the intended impact on the prevalence of the disease in tigers because they get it from wild species anyway.

“Bottom line is that if research shows that domestic dogs and not wild carnivores are the key reservoir of the disease, then a vaccination campaign may help to protect tigers but it is likely that wild populations of other carnivore species are acting as reservoirs, ” says Dr Goodrich.

He says from his observation in the Siberian tigers case, it is imperative that animals are first diagnosed only based on the detection of the actual virus in them. This is because the presence of antibodies indicates only that an animal has been exposed sometime in the past and it might not be a current infection, he explains.

“Clinical diagnoses based on symptoms are often erroneous because there are other common neurologic diseases – for example, rabies, brain tumors, or even tapeworm cysts – that show very similar symptoms, ” he warns.

Like WWF-Malaysia’s Dr Mark Rayan Darmaraj, Dr Goodrich believes that having interconnected forest tracts is crucial to the survival of the Malayan tiger against the CDV.

The best defence to protecting tigers from the CDV and other infectious diseases is to maintain large, healthy populations through having vast expanses of forest, he stresses.

This is because while the CDV outbreak did result in significant loss of tigers from the study area in Russia, the population rebounded after that particular surge of infection was over.

“This was because it (the study area) was part of a large population of tigers covering some 100,000sq km of contiguous habitat.”

Dr Goodrich has previously worked in Malaysia and says the peninsula’s Central Forest Spine is still large enough to contain a similarly robust tiger population.

“Peninsular Malaysia is fortunate in that it still has vast tracts of intact forests large enough to contain a very robust tiger population.

“Maintaining this forest and protecting its tigers and their prey from poaching is the best way to secure the future of Malayan tigers.”";The best way to maintain a robust population of wild tigers;https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiECVsHJHE5iAU3AtgCZzWsmAqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-N7eCjC60NYBMLfbhwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen;https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2020/04/21/651269.jpg;2020-04-21;[{'sent': 'Dr John Goodrich was researching Siberian tigers when he stumbled on an animal infected with the canine distemper virus (CDV) in Pokrovka, Russia, in 2003.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['John Goodrich'], 'ORG': ['CDV'], 'GPE': ['Russia', 'Pokrovka']}}, {'sent': 'Like the tigers in Mersing and Dungun (see story here), the animal had – as recounted by Goodrich to National Geographic – “just walked into town and sat down”.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Dungun', 'Mersing', 'Goodrich'], 'ORG': ['National Geographic']}}, {'sent': '“I am aware of both cases in Malaysia and agree that it raises concerns for tiger health, ” says Dr Goodrich via email.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Malaysia'], 'PERSON': ['Dr Goodrich']}}, {'sent': 'He was working with the Wildlife Conservation Society in 2003.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['the Wildlife Conservation Society']}}, {'sent': 'Today, he is chief scientist and tiger programme director at conservation organisation Panthera and acknowledged as one of the world’s preeminent tiger biologists.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Panthera'], 'CARDINAL': ['one']}}, {'sent': 'He also serves in the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature)', 'ents': {'ORG': ['IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature']}}, {'sent': 'Cat Specialist Group.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Cat Specialist Group']}}, {'sent': 'Researchers estimated that at least 1% of the Siberian tiger population – numbering between 250 and 400 at the time – died of CDV between 2009 and 2013.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['between 250 and 400'], 'ORG': ['CDV']}}, {'sent': 'Dr Goodrich says no attempt was made to contain the disease at that time.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Goodrich']}}, {'sent': 'And in Russia, Dr Goodrich further elaborates, the CDV is likely endemic in a variety of wild carnivores, such as foxes and raccoon dogs, that serve as reservoirs for the disease.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Russia'], 'PERSON': ['Goodrich'], 'ORG': ['CDV']}}, {'sent': '“Bottom line is that if research shows that domestic dogs and not wild carnivores are the key reservoir of the disease, then a vaccination campaign may help to protect tigers but it is likely that wild populations of other carnivore species are acting as reservoirs, ” says Dr Goodrich.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Dr Goodrich']}}, {'sent': 'Dr Mark Rayan Darmaraj', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Mark Rayan']}}, {'sent': ', Dr Goodrich believes that having interconnected forest tracts is crucial to the survival of the Malayan tiger against the CDV.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Goodrich'], 'ORG': ['CDV']}}, {'sent': 'The best defence to protecting tigers from the CDV and other infectious diseases is to maintain large, healthy populations through having vast expanses of forest, he stresses.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['CDV']}}, {'sent': 'This is because while the CDV outbreak did result in significant loss of tigers from the study area in Russia, the population rebounded after that particular surge of infection was over.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['CDV'], 'GPE': ['Russia']}}, {'sent': '“This was because it (the study area) was part of a large population of tigers covering some 100,000sq km of contiguous habitat.”\n\n', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['some 100,000sq km']}}, {'sent': 'Dr Goodrich has previously worked in Malaysia and says the peninsula’s Central Forest Spine is still large enough to contain a similarly robust tiger population.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Goodrich'], 'GPE': ['Malaysia'], 'ORG': ['Central Forest Spine']}}, {'sent': '“Peninsular Malaysia is fortunate in that it still has vast tracts of intact forests large enough to contain a very robust tiger population.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Malaysia']}}, {'sent': '“Maintaining this forest and protecting its tigers and their prey from poaching is the best way to secure the future of Malayan tigers.”', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Malayan']}}];Positive;2020;4;2020;4;694465

Masks are now required when caring for cats at the Greater Vancouver Zoo in Aldergrove, after a tiger in an American zoo tested positive for COVID-19.

“We have implemented increased precautionary measures such as all animal care staff are required to wear masks in specific situations particularly when in close proximity to felines,” animal care manager Menita Prasad said.

“As this is the first case of its kind, we are aware that certain animal species are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19,” she explained.

News broke in early April that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the corona-virus, after showing respiratory symptoms on March 27, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

The Aldergrove zoo has lions, a Siberian tiger, and cheetah that fit into the feline category.

Prasad said, prior to the instance, the zoo follows safety protocols to “minimize disease transmission” between animals and staff.

As COVID-19 cases have emerged in Langley, and the first animal transmission of the virus has struck the U.S., staff at the local zoo and the animals they care for continue to practise social distancing.

The 120-acre facility has been closed to the public, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 18.

COVID-19 and pet owners

The same U.S. Agriculture Department report that revealed a tiger at the Bronx Zoo was infected with COVID, encouraged everyday pet owners, if sick, to “wash their hands before and after the interaction.”

Conversely, “at this time, there is no evidence to suggest that any animals, including pets or livestock, can spread COVID-19 infection to people,” it added.

A 6-month-old giant panda met visitors to the Shanghai Wild Animal Park in the Pudong New Area on Saturday.

The giant panda, who is yet to be officially named, is known as ""Jia Jia boy"" to zookeepers as his mother is named Jia Jia. He was born on October 6 last year, and weighed 185 grams at birth.

He grew to 1,542 grams when he was one month, and now he is over 18 kilograms, leading to his other nickname ""little fatty.""

He was timid and slender when he was born but is now chubby with large eyes, animal keepers said.

He is also very active, naughty and bold, and likes climbing.

But he sometimes acts like a spoilt child, snatching food from his mother and distracting her while she is trying to feed.



The park operator has installed several screens showing a video clip of the boy's growth, and a real-time live broadcast at the giant panda area.

Visitors are reminded to keep quiet and not use flash photography when viewing the pandas.

A six-month-old giant panda cub met with visitors at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park in Pudong New Area on Saturday.



The cub, which has yet to be given a name, was born on October 6 and is the offspring of another giant panda Jia Jia which lives in the park.



The cub, which weighed just 185 grams at birth, now weighs more than 18 kilograms.



According to the animal keeper, the baby panda used to be slim and timid but now loves climbing to high places. It also likes to stay with his mother and has been learning how to chew bamboo.

Welcome back to the Tiger Woods YouTube Project, where we’re in the midst of a winning streak. Oh, and Tiger is, too. Today, Bay Area resident Josh Sens breaks down one of Woods’ most unlikely comeback victories on a Monday finish at Pebble Beach in 2000.

Yeah, we already borrowed one video from 2000, but that was a heck of a year — which means it’s worth reinforcing from a few different angles. Before we join the action, let’s contextualize where Tiger Woods was competitively at this point in time. He’d finished off 1999 with wins in seven of his final 10 PGA Tour events, including his last four: two WGCs, the Tour Championship and the National Car Rental Classic at Disney.

Then 2000 began at the Mercedes Championship in Maui, where Woods and Ernie Els entered Sunday tied and remained that way heading to No. 18, where each made eagle (I repeat: each made eagle!) to get into a playoff. Woods birdied the first playoff hole and poured in a 40-footer on the second to win. In summary, it didn’t seem like Woods could lose at this point.

Tiger Woods YouTube Project, Chapter 16: The ridiculous comeback

RELATED: Chapter 15 — “How Tiger and MJ became friends”

But it sure started to look like Woods would finally lose in his next start out. Midway through the final round at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he trailed by 7 shots. You already know what happened later that summer at Pebble, when Woods ran and hid from the rest of the field in a 15-shot romp. But you may well have forgotten the biggest late charge of his career. Let’s rewatch the film, shall we? And then we’ll hear from Northern California correspondent Josh Sens.

Here’s Josh Sens, proud Oakland resident, with 10 takeaways upon rewatching Woods alongside the rest of you. Enjoy!

1. For starters, Tiger was so much younger. Granted, we all were. But what makes Tiger’s youth so striking in these clips is the fact that he was playing like a man among boys. This was skinny Tiger, pre-bulked up Tiger, and he’s practically swimming in his Sunday red (except that it’s a Monday; more on that in a minute). He also almost sounds like pre-pubescent Tiger. Listen to his voice, caught on microphone here and there. It’s that youthful nasal twang that is still evident when he speaks today but now not nearly as pronounced. If you close your eyes and cup your ears to the 2000 Tiger, you think, Wait, THIS is the guy who rules the world?

2. I’d forgotten that this was a Monday finish. Another wet week at the AT&T. That’s how it always used to seem to be. Not long after came an extended drought here in Northern California, which made a lot of us who live here wonder if it would ever rain again. It rained again last year, at the 2019 AT&T, when Phil Mickelson won on Monday at Pebble. It was the first Monday finish in the event since 2000. But I digress. Point is, it was not your regularly scheduled programming . I don’t have the TV ratings handy, but I wonder how many fans who’d watched on Sunday wound up missing out on this historic close.

3. And dang, what a close. Woods was five back to start the day and seven behind as he made the turn. His run really starts on 12, where he stuffs his tee shot to a pin tucked left on that long par-3. Yes, the conditions were spongy, but watch how softly Tiger’s ball lands there, on a slender tongue of the putting surface. If you’ve played that hole, you know how ridiculously tough that shot is for most mortals. But that was Tiger. Making the implausible look routine.

4. And then, of course, there’s the hole-out for eagle on the par-4 15th. 97 yards, with a wedge. A thunderbolt, electrifying TV. Re-watching it, I got a kick out of hearing the call from then-CBS commentator Bobby Clampett, who grew up on the Monterey Peninsula and had once been seen as the can’t-miss kid. With Tiger’s ball in the air, Clampett says he likes the club selection, and then, his voice rising, that he likes the shot. As the ball drops, Clampett punctuates the moment with a nice minimalist ‘Oh!’—a restrained call, straight out of the Frank Chirkinian school.

5. Tiger has a lot of special gifts, but in those days, one of his greatest X-Men powers was his ability to make everyone fold around him, even if they weren’t in his immediate orbit. You get a glimpse of this in the YouTube clips. No sooner has Tiger holed out for eagle on 15 than we cut to leader Matt Gogel botching a drive, and Vijay Singh leaving one in the bunker. Tiger was paired with Jim Furyk that day. We get a flash of Furyk’s name on the back of his caddie’s jumper, but otherwise, he’s nowhere to be seen. In addition to making them fall apart, Tiger had a way of turning his playing partners invisible, too.

6. Tiger entered this event having won five in a row. Five in a row! Soon to be six. The record winning streak in PGA Tour history belongs to Byron Nelson, with 11. That was in 1945. Ben Hogan won six straight in 1948. But extended win streaks simply don’t happen in the modern game. Aside from Tiger’s. In 2006-07, it’s worth remembering, he reeled off seven in a row.

7. So, Tiger jars his approach for eagle on the par-15th, and then, on the next hole, also a par-4, he nearly repeats the feat. As his ball is in the air, Peter Kostis — another broadcaster no longer on the CBS team — says that the shot sounded heavy. Um. Guess not. A nano-second later, the ball nearly drops in the cup.

8. Pebble itself plays so differently depending on the time of year. Winter and summer are polar opposites. It’s not just the wet and soft conditions turning firm and dry. The prevailing wind flip-flops, coming from the south in winter and the north in the summer. That’s something that comes into clear relief in years when the course also hosts the U.S. Open. 2000 was just that sort of year. And we know who won that one as well, in record fashion, on a Pebble that was playing very differently. Anyway, I was reminded of the winter winds while watching Tiger play 18 in the AT&T. Driver, long iron to just in front of the green. In the summer, when the wind is up, you don’t usually see guys playing the 18th that way. Not even guys like Tiger.

9. Speaking of the 18th, Tiger’s drive on that hole hugged the coastline on the left. It was an aggressive line, very risky. If it were almost any other player at almost any other time, you’d have to figure that he pulled it. But this was peak-Tiger, at a moment in a tournament when it mattered most. So you got to figure he hit it exactly where he was aiming.

10. So Matt Gogel, then a rookie, was going for his first PGA Tour win, but he stumbled home in 40 and lost to Woods by two. Crushing, right? But to Gogel’s credit, he wins this very event two years later. Nice bounce-back. I mention Gogel here because in the YouTube clip, they show two views simultaneously as Gogel is putting out on 18, with Tiger looking on from a split screen. When his win becomes official, Tiger celebrates in a three-way hug with two other guys who were in his inner-circle but no more: Stevie Williams and Butch Harmon. Our colleague Michael Bamberger just published an excellent book called The Second Life of Tiger Woods. Given all that Woods has been through, that celebration at Pebble in 2000 seems like many lives ago.

The Netflix series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” exposed stunning allegations of animal abuse.

Exotic was convicted of nine violations of the Endangered Species Act after charges that included shooting and killing five healthy tigers in October 2017.

He was also found guilty in a murder-for-hire plot to kill a rival animal habitat owner and is currently serving a 22-year sentence.

But many are asking: Were others involved in Exotic’s criminal enterprises?

The one-hour special, produced by TMZ and available right now on Fox Nation, included reporting that the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Fish and Wildlife have launched investigations into the sale and transportation of endangered species, notably tigers.

Exotic’s former business partner and current owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park, Jeff Lowe, as well as a South Carolina zoo owner Bhagavan “Doc” Antle are featured in the Netflix series and they spoke to TMZ.

Both vehemently any allegations of animal abuse, but others are not so sure.

“All I can say is that ‘Doc’ Antle is under investigation by multiple agencies,” said Brittany Peet, an attorney for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). “I have not heard that Jeff Lowe is under investigation, but he should be.”

In fact, Peet claimed that Exotic dished to her about his dealings with other zoo owners.

“He wanted to try to ally himself with us,” said Peet, “He even suggested that he might someday be a spokesperson for PETA speaking out against the cub petting industry and the roadside zoo industry. And he offered to share with me dirt that he had about others in the captive wildlife industry. And he did.”

In two extended interviews, also now available on Fox Nation, former prosecutor and Fox Nation host Nancy Grace spoke to a juror on Exotic’s trial and a former employee of the zoo, who told her that there are more animal abusers out there.

“I’m sure if they dig deep enough, they’re going to find a lot more players in this,” said Kelci “Saff” Saffery, a former animal handler at the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park. “I mean, the entire animal industry is connected.”

Saffery also detailed how Exotic would kill any animal — not only tigers — if he determined that he could profit off their deaths.

Kristen, the juror who sat on the panel that convicted Exotic, told Grace that she wished that former Lowe has taken the stand in the trial.

“I was honestly disappointed that Jeff Lowe didn’t take the stand. I did kind of want to hear how he was tied into it all,” she said.

lying in its natural resting position with one arm casually resting behind its head and the other clutching a selfie stick, the artist’s vision is to create a colossal and iconic sculpture of a panda. ‘selfie panda’ aims to shows the irony of how big the giant pandas are in china and to the rest of the world, and its playfulness of loving itself in vain.
