The three, all from the square-lipped rhinoceros family, were soon captured and returned to the Ramat Gan safari and the guard was let go.

According to the Ramat Gan Safari spokesperson, Sagit Horowitz, the incident took place at 6 am Thursday morning, when the director of the safari opened the gate to the compound.

One of the rhinos is named Rihanna in honor of the Barbadian singer and the other Keren Peles, a famous Israeli singer, songwriter and composer.

""By 6:15 am I had received a call from local police saying that a couple of rhinos had escaped,"" Yehuda Bar, the safari's director told Ynet, adding that when he returned to the open gate, the police were already there, blocking the exit.

The safari is adjacent to the Ramat Gan National Part, where Bar soon found the rhinos. ""I found two of older female rhinos playing around with a third younger one in the parking lot and in less than a minute or a minute and a half later they were back in the safari.""

Bar says the safari's security guard is at fault as it was his responsibility to close and keep an eye on the gate (from which they left). He failed to notice them leaving, probably because he was asleep, and thus he was fired effective immediately.""

According to the safari's spokesperson, the rhinos were actually attempting to return to the safari, but failed to find the entrance. ""They ran into some people jogging in the part and were frightened… Yehuda (the manager) began clapping to get their attention and they found their way back through the gate."""~[]

There are fewer than 500 of the rare Amur tigers left in the wild, according tothe Wildlife Conservation Society. The endangered species lives in remote, mountainous territory that makes it difficult to watch the tigers and monitor their natural behavior. So researchers use remotely activated camera traps to help catch the tigers as they hunt, play and move through the vast territory of Russia's Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve and Udegeiskaya Legenda National Park (two adjacent protected areas).

The new photos from the Wildlife Conservation Society show a family of five Amur tigers padding through the snow this winter, lined up from large to small like nesting dolls. Although family group behavior has been seen in Bengal tigers many times, this is the first evidence of male Amur tigers in a family setting, rather than as solitary cats, researchers said. [Iconic Cats: All 9 Subspecies of Tigers]

""We have collected hundreds of photos of tigers over the years, but this is the first time we have recorded a family together,"" Svetlana Soutyrina, deputy director for scientific programs at the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, said in a statement. ""These images confirm that male Amur tigers do participate in family life, at least occasionally, and we were lucky enough to capture one such moment.""

The 21 photos show the tiger family walking in front of the same camera within 2 minutes.

""These photos provide a small vignette of social interactions of Amur tigers, and provide an evocative snapshot of life in the wild for these magnificent animals,"" Dale Miquelle, Russia director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, said in the statement.

The camera trap was part of a camera network installed throughout the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve and Udegeiskaya Legenda National Park during a 2014-2015 population count of the endangered Amur tigers. Every 10 years, hundreds of volunteers survey the remote region to estimate the tiger population. In 2005, there were 430 to 500 tigers remaining in the wild, according to the survey.

Amur tigers once ranged throughout the Russian Far East, northern China and Korea. But by the 1940s, hunting and habitat loss brought their numbers down to only 40 tigers left in the wild. Thanks to conservation efforts, the population rebounded to around 500 by the 1980s, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. However, the tiger population is restricted to reserves in the Russian Far East and China.

Camera traps have also helped monitor the population of another rare Russian cat — the Amur leopard. Photos and video footage from the World Wildlife Fund suggest the number of Amur leopards has nearly doubled, from 30 in 2007 to 57 in 2014.

And the following month, he formally launched the “Make in India"" initiative with a walking lion as its logo.

After affixing the lion logo to its flagship programme, the Modi government suggested a far more radical change. At a March meeting of the National Board for Wildlife, it suggested that the Asiatic lion replace the tiger as India’s national animal.

Interestingly, before 1972, the lion was the national animal of India. The Indira Gandhi-led Congress government replaced it with the tiger when it launched Project Tiger—the country’s first wildlife conservation programme.

Both the lion and tiger are on the endangered list of wild animals and are protected by the laws of the land. There are around 400 lions and 2,000 tigers in the Indian wilderness today.

The proposal to revert to the lion as the national animal has created tumult among tiger conservationists. According to them, the lion doesn’t have a national presence like the tiger, whose population is spread over 18 states.

India has 48 tiger reserves. The Indian lion (or the Asiatic lion) is only found in the Gir National Park and its surroundings in Gujarat which, incidentally, happens to be the Prime Minister’s home state.

Wildlife conservation in India is species-centric and not landscape-centric. It is largely concentrated on iconic species such as the tiger, lion, elephant and rhinoceros.

Among these four species, the tiger is the superstar when it comes to revenue—for conservation and tourism. The government’s proposal to reinstate the lion as the national animal has, not surprisingly, left the tiger conservation fraternity puzzled and worried.

A couple of centuries ago, the lion had an extended range over northern India. In eastern India, it was recorded in Bihar; in the south, by the Narmada river. Widespread hunting at that time was one of the prime reasons for the depletion of the lion population.

But for the timely intervention of the sixth Nawab of Junagadh, Mahabat Khanji II (1851-1882), who banned hunting, the lion would have been wiped out from the Indian subcontinent.

Sasan Gir in Gujarat, in the erstwhile state of Junagadh, remains the last abode of the lion and the Gujarati community takes immense pride that the last of Asia’s lions are on its turf.

The increasing reference to the species as the “Lion of Gir"" has branded the Asiatic lion as the “Gir Lion"".

Over the past two decades, more than ₹ 24 crore has been spent on the Kuno-Palpur sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh, billed as the second home for the endangered beasts. But the sanctuary has no lions, because Gujarat does not want to give it any.

The risk here is of keeping all eggs in the same basket. According to conservationists, an epidemic in Gir might exterminate the species. The need for a second gene pool is urgently required to protect the species.

The lion is historically better represented than the tiger—in medieval literature, in coinage, art, artifacts and architecture. The use of the lion in symbols and signage gained importance in India from the second half of the first millennium, with the rise of the great Hindu kingdoms—the Nandas, Mauryas and Guptas. Emperor Ashoka’s Lion Pillar gave India its national emblem. In religion, the lion is mentioned in the Rig Veda, the first of the four sacred texts in Hinduism; it is the divine mount of goddess Durga and worshipped as Narasimha, an avatar of Hindu god Vishnu, visualized as half-man and half-lion.

Mahavir and Buddha also used the lion as their symbol. Gautam Buddha’s first sermon was called simhanada, the lion’s roar, and he himself came to be known as Sakyasimha, the lion of the Sakyas. The lion was the symbol of royalty in Hindu mythology where the king and his throne—the singhasan (the lion’s seat)—were inseparable.

In northern India, Singh, meaning lion, has been used as a middle name or surname since the seventh century by Hindus and later by Sikhs. Indeed, it is not surprising to come across Sikhs with both big cats in their name—Sher Singh. It was not only the Hindu kingdoms, the symbol of lion found prominence both in the Mughal and British empires.

Modi, under whom the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014 became the first party in 30 years to win a majority on its own in the Lok Sabha, is surely entitled to his singhasan. But as he talks of heralding a new Industrial Revolution, can the lion become the symbol of the Indian economy? And where will the tiger go from here?

rhino numbers collapsed due to poaching for their horns, a lot rides on one pampered animal in the Kenyan savannah doing his best to further the species



Mohamed Doyo seems to have a dream job. Every evening, he patrols the Kenyan savannah, glimpsing lions chasing down darting Thomson’s gazelles, hearing the calls of red-chested cuckoos and, when there is a full moon, seeing the majestic, snow-capped peaks of Mount Kenya in the distance.

But Doyo can scarcely stop to admire the extraordinary views because he and a large squad of rangers perform an extraordinary job: they must keep poachers away from one of the rarest species on earth, including the star attraction at the 135 sq mile conservancy, Sudan, the world’s last male northern white rhino.

“This responsibility weighs so heavily on our shoulders,” says Doyo. “It is sad what human greed has done and now we must keep watch every minute because it would be unimaginable if the poachers succeeded in killing these last few animals.”

The precipitous decline in the number of wild rhinos is the result of the dramatic rise in poaching in the 20th century.

About half a million rhinos roamed in Africa and Asia in 1900. That figure had fallen to 70,000 by 1970, with some species near to disappearing.

By 2011, the western black rhino had been declared extinct, an abrupt end to a species that had walked the earth for 5m years.

Recent conservation efforts have rallied overall rhino population numbers to 29,000, but poaching remains a real threat.

Some sub-species are more threatened than others, with the northern white rhino leading the most precarious existence.

An accident of geography accounted for the fact these magnificent animals, distinguishable from black rhinos by their square lips and hairy ears, were decimated faster than other sub-species. Northern white rhinos were found in the wild in countries marked by instability, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and Sudan.

Their population was about 2,000 in the 1960s but by 1984, only 15 remained in the wild in the DRC’s Garamba national park, and they were soon wiped out by poachers.

Today, there are only five remaining and three of them are to be found at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy, a sprawling windswept ranch of dun-coloured thickets and acacia trees in central Kenya, where efforts to save the species are centred.

All the pressure is on Sudan, the last male of the species, to mate with Fatu and Najin, the two female rhinos with whom he shares a 300-hectare enclosure.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Najin, a female northern white rhino at Ol Pejeta Conservancy. Photograph: Sun Ruibo/Xinhua Press/Corbis

But continuing the lineage may be too much to ask of a 42-year-old male that spent most of its life in a Czech zoo before it was transferred to Kenya in 2009, in the hope that life in the wild would offer a better chance at procreation.

Not that the pressure seems to wear too heavily on Sudan. A massive presence, weighing in at 1.2 tons, and coloured a silvery brown with speckles of the dung and mud in which he likes to wallow during the day marking his thick skin, Sudan may have noticed he is a bit special.

Kept under 24-hour armed guard, with a stream of visitors coming to see him every day, he plays along, rising with great reluctance at the call of his keeper before munching the lucerne grass, or alfalfa, of which he is especially fond, and inviting his keeper to rub his back.

Yet Sudan, who is in old age (rhino life expectancy is 40-50 years), embodies the struggle to beat the scourge of poaching that has driven these animals, which have few natural predators in the wild, to the brink of extinction.

The Ol Pejeta ranch is also home to 106 black rhinos, making it the biggest rhino conservancy in east Africa.

“The pressure from poaching is constant,” says Richard Vigne, a second-generation Kenyan of British origin who is chief executive of the conservancy. “Securing rhinos has become so expensive and risky that many conservancies have given up keeping rhinos altogether and brought them here.”

The appetite for killing rhinos to saw off their horn is fuelled by demand in the far east, which has risen as countries such as Vietnam, one of the biggest consumers of rhino horn, and China have become more prosperous.

Rhino horn is made of keratin, the same material as human toenails, but an unfounded belief that it cures everything from hangovers to cancer and can serve as an aphrodisiac, has fed demand and sent prices soaring to an estimated $75,000 (£50,000) a kilo.

Vigne says progress has been made in tackling the poaching menace but it is uneven.

“In fairness to the Kenyan government, they have done a good job, especially in tightening sanctions for those caught. But it’s not the same everywhere and in places such as southern Tanzania, poaching is simply out of control.”

Even South Africa has seen a stark rise in poaching levels, losing a staggering 1,215 rhinos in 2014 alone, up from just 13 in 2007.

To win the support of local communities that are often resentful of the huge tracts of land required to keep animals in their natural habitat, the Ol Pejeta ranch is championing what it calls an integrated land-management model that sees it keep cattle and grow wheat on sections of the land, which means employment for more locals and more income to fund conservation efforts.

A sharp downturn in tourists coming to Kenya has squeezed revenues, prompting the conservancy to launch an online fundraising campaign.

With the clock ticking on Sudan’s life, veterinarians at the zoo are expected in the next few months to propose artificial ways of keeping the species alive.

They will harvest semen from Sudan and combine it with eggs from a female northern white rhino to create an embryo that will be implanted in a southern white rhino.

“It is unfortunate that it has come to this but we have to keep looking forward and hope the future is brighter than the past,” says Vigne. “The key task for conservationists is to ensure that there are more births than deaths of rhinos, which is not an easy task but we must take it on.”"~[]

Wildlife experts have welcomed census figures showing India’s population of endangered Asiatic lions has increased in the last five years in the western state of Gujarat.



Gujarat chief minister Anandiben Patel said officials counted 523 lions, up 27% from the last census conducted in 2010 in Gir sanctuary, the last habitat for the big cats globally.

The census was conducted over five days earlier this month in the 20,000 sqkm (7,700 sq m) sanctuary and surrounding forest lands.

“There are 109 male lions, 201 females and 213 cubs in the Gir sanctuary and nearby forest areas of Junagadh district,” Patel said on Sunday.

Officials have said the experts conducting the census used a combination of direct sightings, photographs and GPS tracking technology to document each lion and avoid double counting.

About 2,500 people, including wildlife experts from India’s top universities, participated in the counting process.

The last census in 2010 showed 411 lions, up from 359 in 2005.

WWF India director Diwakar Sharma welcomed the numbers but said the larger population posed challenges for managing their habitat and conflict with humans.

“This is good news on the conservation front but bigger populations in bigger areas increases the challenge of managing land, human and animal conflict,” he told AFP.

“There (also) has to be some other place far away from Gir (for lions) so that in a time of catastrophe, we don’t lose the population.”

The Gujarat government is fighting a Supreme Court ruling in 2013 for some of the lions to be moved to a wildlife sanctuary in a neighbouring state to ensure their long-term survival in case of disease.

The cats are a subspecies of lion which are slightly smaller than their African cousins and have a fold of skin along their bellies. They are a major attraction for tourists to Gujarat.

India faces intense international scrutiny over its conservation efforts because it is home to many endangered species, including tigers.

Conservation efforts were hailed in January after 2,226 tigers were spotted in a country-wide census, a 30% increase in the population from 2010.

Authorities across Asia are waging a major battle against poachers, who often sell tiger body parts to the lucrative traditional Chinese medicine market, as well as other man-made problems such as habitat loss."~[]

In a race to save this subspecies (Ceratotherium simum cottoni), conservationists and veterinarians are turning to in vitro fertilization. But will they run out of time or quality semen?

Sudan Eating

Sudan, the last male northern white rhino, eats in his paddock at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. At 42, Sudan is too old to mount a female, and his sperm quality is poor. Veterinarians are trying to bank the rhino's sperm for use in in vitro fertilization. (Photo Credit: Ol Pejeta Conservancy)

Female northern whites

Najin and Fatu are two of the four remaining female northern white rhinoceroses left. Along with Sudan, both were transferred from a zoo in the Czech Republic to Kenya. Najin is old and has leg problems that prevent her from sustaining a mating, according to Ol Pejeta CEO Richard Vigne. Fatu has never bred, and now has uterine problems that likely prevent her from carrying a pregnancy. (Photo Credit: Erico Hiller)

Rhino threats

Because rhino horn is basically fingernail material, it's painless to cut and does grow back. But rhino horn is valued in traditional Eastern medicine as a supposed cure from everything from fever to rheumatism, which has led to rampant poaching of all five rhinoceros species. The northern white rhinoceros is the closest to extinction, but Indonesia's Javan and Sumatran rhinos are not far behind. Africa's black rhinoceros is also critically endangered, while the southern white rhinoceros is merely ""near threatened."" (Photo Credit: Ian Aitken)

Rhinos in captivity

Apple for Sudan

Mohammed, a keeper at Ol Pejeta, feeds Sudan in his enclosure. According to the Conservancy, Sudan recognizes his keepers by their voices and is calm around them. It would not be wise to get this close to a rhino in the wild — these animals more than 5,500 pounds (2,500 kilograms) and can run at top speeds of 30 miles per hour (48 kilometers per hour).

The Siberian tiger population continues to rebound, according to the latest numbers from the subspecies’ stronghold in Russia. Ten years ago, conservationists estimated 423-502 Amur tigers in Siberia. But last month, the Russian government and WWF said numbers had risen to 480-540 tigers, including an estimated 100 cubs.

“This success is due to the commitment of Russia’s political leadership and the tireless dedication of rangers and conservationists in very difficult conditions,” said Igor Chestin, the head of WWF-Russia.

Tiger conservation has been a rare environmental priority for Russia’s current government as Vladimir Putin has consistently highlighted the importance of the world’s biggest cats. It’s thought that around 95 percent of the world’s Siberian tigers are still found in Russia.

Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), also known as Amur tigers, were almost wiped off the face of the Earth. In the 1930s, the population dropped to just 20-30 individuals before being saved by conservationists over decades. The species remains endangered by deforestation and prey decline, but poaching for their body parts is still the biggest threat to the Siberian tiger.

Even as the population grows in Far East Russia, the subspecies may be returning permanently to China as well. Camera traps have caught individual tigers across the border in China over recent years. Then earlier this year, a camera trap video showed a family of tigers–a mom and two cubs–for the first time in China, showing that the subspecies was very likely breeding there. In all, scientists believe more than two dozen Siberian tigers live along the Russian-Chinese border.

China is currently mulling removing barbed wire and other impediments from the border crossing at Primorsky Krai to allow both tigers and Amur leopards easier crossing.

“In nature there are no borders and predators do not have passports, so it is not in our power to tell tigers when to go to China or come back,” Sergei Aramilev, the director of the Primorsky branch of the Siberian Tiger Centre, told The Siberian Times. “The recovery of the tiger numbers in China will create a backup of the population, which may in the future be used to increase the genetic diversity that is important for populations with low numbers.”

No one knows if North Korea still houses Siberian tigers, but there is still suitable habitat there.

Siberian tigers are the world’s largest cats and one of the biggest land predators. They are easily distinguished from other tiger subspecies due to their considerably shaggier coats adapted to the long, rough winters of Siberia. Tigers, worldwide, are in crisis. Conservationists estimate only around 2,500 survive

In 2010, the 13-tiger range countries pledged to double the world’s tiger population by 2022 and raised over $300 million to achieve this goal. Tiger populations are currently growing in India, Nepal, and Russia. But the outlook is far more bleak in many other countries, including Indonesia and Malaysia. The last century saw three tiger subspecies go extinct. Today, six remain, though one—the South China tiger—is likely extinct in the wild."~[]

A new survey last month put the number of wild Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) at 523 individuals, a rise of 27% from the previous survey in 2010. Once roaming across much of Central and Western Asia, Asiatic lions today are found in only one place: Gir Forest National Park and surrounding environs in western India.

“There are 109 male lions, 201 females and 213 cubs in the Gir sanctuary and nearby forest areas of Junagadh district,” said Anandiben Patel, the chief minister of the state Gujarat, where Gir Forest National Park is located.

The population has been steadily rising over the last ten years. In 2005, India counted 359 Asiatic lions. Then in 2010 the population rose to 411 lions.

Classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List, the Asiatic lion is threatened by poaching. But mostly the population is imperiled due to surviving in just one place; conservationists fear that a single natural disaster or disease could wipe them out. Still, plans to move a portion of the population have been held up to date by Gujarat state."~[]

In late July, after his mother was killed by poachers in South Africa, Donnie the orphaned baby rhinoceros was desperate to find a parent-shaped object to take care of him. A tourist’s gray Hyundai Santa Fe seemed to fulfill all his requirements — gray, imposing, decent gas mileage. Donnie snuggled his new mom’s bumper until park rangers came to tranquilize him and take him to a new home in Kruger National Park.

The rhino reacted badly to the drug, and went into cardiac arrest while being transported. The plane he was in had to make an emergency landing. The daughter of the park ranger Donnie is named after wrote on Facebook, “After 3 minutes of resuscitation and trying everything to save him … everyone involved was amazed (some with tear filled eyes) when he gasped for air and his little heart started up again!”

At press time, we were unable to discern whether his adoptive mother’s comment — “Honk” — meant she was sad that she’d never see Donnie again or she was glad that the authorities took him away before he scratched her new paint job."~[]

This adorable, cheeky face belongs to a rare and extremely cute red panda cub born at a zoo in Cornwall just a few weeks ago.

The as yet unnamed baby is the first of its kind to be bred in captivity by Newquay Zoo in Cornwall.

It was born just five weeks ago to Germaine and Sandy, who have lived at the zoo for several years.

Known as the lesser panda to distinguish itself from the better known giant panda, red pandas are in sharp decline in the wild.

Native to the eastern Himalayas and south western China, locally the red panda is known as ‘poonya' and in Nepal they are called ‘chitwahs' or ‘wahs'.

The animal is already extinct in four of the seven Chinese provinces. Reasons for this decline in numbers include poaching for fur and pet trades, competition from domestic livestock and loss and fragmentation of habitat through deforestation.

The declining numbers mean the birth of a new panda is a triumph for the battle to conserve their species, John Meek, curator of animals at the zoo said.

He added: “This is an amazing addition to our panda family here at Newquay and our senior carnivore keeper Owen Taylor could not be more thrilled that the cub was actually bred here. It is another fantastic conservation win for all the staff and keepers.""

The birth was announced days before International Red Panda Day on September 19, which aims to raise awareness of the threatened species.

Started by conservation group WWF South Africa in 2010, World Rhino Day has grown into a global phenomenon to spread the word about both the beauty of rhinoceros and the dangers they are facing. Here are ten stunning photos and interesting facts about rhinos, as well as ways to contribute to World Rhino Day.

1. There are five species of rhino, which are indigenous to Africa and Asia: black, white, greater one-horned or Indian, Sumatran and Javan rhinos. World Rhino Day celebrates all five species.

2. Rhinos have been around for more than 50 million years. Some of the world’s first rhinos didn’t have horns and roamed through North America and Europe. But no known rhino species have ever inhabited the South American or Australian continents. The Sumatran rhino is the closest living relative of the ancient woolly rhino.

3. Rhino is short for rhinocerous, which means “nose horn.” The rhino’s horn is not bone and it’s not attached to its skull. In fact, its hollow and made from a protein called keratin, the same substance that makes up fingernails and hair. Just like our own hair and nails, a rhino’s horn continues to grow throughout the animal’s lifetime. The longest known horn was 4 feet 9 inches long on a black rhino, which on average has a 20-inch horn, according to Save the Rhino, a conservation charity based in the United Kingdom.

4. Three of the rhino species are listed as “critically endangered” by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species, which means they have a 50 percent chance of becoming extinct in three generations. With its headquarters in the United Kingdom, the IUCN is the world’s leading authority on the conservation status of species.

5. The IUCN Red List identifies Javan and Sumatran rhinos, two species native to Asia, and the black rhino, which is native to eastern and central Africa, as “critically endangered.” The Indian or greater one-horned rhino, native to the Indian subcontinent, is identified as “vulnerable.” And the white rhino, which mainly lives in South Africa, is identified as “near threatened.”

6. Rhinos can grow to over 6 feet tall and more than 11 feet long. The white rhino is the second largest land mammal after the elephant, with adult males weighing up to a massive 3.6 tons. Thanks to conservation efforts, this rhino species was brought back from the brink of extinction. But a surge in poaching for their horns has seen a record number killed in recent years. There are 20,000 southern white rhinos living in protected areas and private game reserves, mostly in South Africa, and just four northern white rhinos living in captivity in Kenya and the United States, according to WWF.

7. The Javan rhino is the world’s rarest land mammal and less than 50 survive in Indonesia’s Ujong Kulon National Park, according to Save the Rhino.

8. Rhinos have poor eyesight and have difficulty detecting someone only a hundred feet away. But they have a high sense of smell and well-developed hearing and can run up to 40 miles per hour.

9. Rhinos have thick skin that can be very sensitive to sunburns and insect bites. The animals wallow in mud, which protects their skin from the sun and bites when it dries.

It’s #WorldRhinoDay! Let's celebrate these amazing species and protect them for future generations. #iam4rhinos pic.twitter.com/pV7NoxaVRG — WWF South Africa (@WWFSouthAfrica) September 22, 2015

10. Rhinoceros pregnancies last for 15 to 16 months and mother rhinos are very nurturing. Their young stay with them until they are about 3 years old, according to Save the Rhino.

To celebrate World Rhino Day, visit Haus and Toy, two white rhinos at Canada’s Safari Niagara in Stevensville, Ontario. Be sure to post photos of Haus and Toy on social media using the hashtags #safariniagara and #worldrhinoday to spread love and awareness about the endangered species on social media."~[]

After a series of illnesses, Nola, a 41-year-old female, had to be euthanized by San Diego Zoo staff Sunday. Vets had been treating the rhino for a bacterial infection and had recently performed surgery to drain an abscess, but Nola’s condition worsened.

“This is a very difficult loss for the animal care staff who worked with her, our volunteers, guests, and to her species worldwide,” the zoo wrote on its Facebook page, in announcing Nola’s death. “Nola’s legacy will live forever as her death leaves just 3 northern white rhinos on the planet,” the zoo added.

Rhinos in the wild have a life expectancy of 35 to 40 years. Nola had been at the San Diego Zoo since 1989, when she arrived from a zoo in what is now the Czech Republic. Only three more northern white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) remain, all at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, where they are watched over by armed guards 24/7 in response to intense poaching pressure.

A female northern white rhino named Nabiré died in a Czech zoo in July.

The three remaining rhinos (two females, one male) are considered too old to reproduce naturally. However, scientists have harvested sex cells from the individuals and are planning in vitro fertilization in a related southern white rhino surrogate in a last-ditch effort to save the subspecies. That effort is expected to take more than a decade.

Rapid Decline

Rhinoceros populations in both Asia and Africa have suffered for decades due to habitat loss and poaching, which is spurred mainly by demand for their horns as an ingredient in many traditional Asian medicines (which Western scientists say do not work). (See a map of the international illegal trade in rhinos.)

The northern white rhinoceros subspecies was once robust throughout central Africa, with populations ranging from southern Chad to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Their numbers declined precipitously from more than 2,000 in 1960 to only 15 individuals by 1984.

Like their northern relatives, the southern white rhino went through previous periods of decline, and only a handful remained at the turn of the century. However, conservation efforts by the South African government have helped the subspecies rebound to a population of around 20,000, through breeding and relocating rhinos, as well as allowing controlled sport hunting, which is controversial but has encouraged some landowners to raise rhinos. (Related: ""Why African Rhinos Are Facing a Crisis."")

“Let this be a warning of what is happening to wildlife everywhere,” the San Diego Zoo wrote in regards to Nola’s passing.

Excerpts:

Congratulations! You guys seem to have had a very good time during the last six years. Your numbers are up by 22 per cent. Enjoying life, eh?

Enjoying life? Bah! What the heck are you talking about? The Mrs has just had a litter of six — six, I tell you, and now she’s at me about helping her feed and potty-train the brats and change their nappies and teach them to hunt! Ever since that Ranthambore ninny started looking after his cubs, every tigress is now demanding the same from her man!

I’m sure if you could assist her, you could bring up larger families and it could help in increasing the number of tigers all around. That surely would be a good thing.

Do you think she’s the only Mrs I have? What kind of wuss do you take me for, eh? My magnificent genes have to be spread as far and wide as possible. I have to patrol vast territories and get to know as many ladies as I can. How many squalling brats can I possibly look after? Besides, some want nilgai, others want chital and others throw tantrums if they don’t get smoked ham — as if I own a fast-food restaurant or something!

But the government is widening all the roads running through national parks and tiger reserves, so travel will be easier and quicker and smoother. Soon, you’ll have 10-lane expressways to walk along instead of narrow forest tracks.

We try and cross a road and either we get run over or the bus careens into a ditch. Expressway indeed!

The government is certainly building enormous swimming pools for you…linking rivers and drowning large tracts of forest. They seem to appreciate that you’re water-loving animals, like to loll about in pools…

As if we have nothing better to do. I have a Mrs who is snarling. She thinks I better hunt for the cubs or else, and here you think I have time to loll around in swimming pools!

Well, it couldn’t be so bad — look at the tigers in the Sunderbans. They even hunt in the water…

You know what kind of reputation those salties have! Do you want all of us to become like that?

They say the Sunderbans tigers are exceptionally ferocious because of the saltiness of the water…

Yeah, it gives them man-eating kidneys! As for the waters of these linked rivers, do you think they’ll be pure mineral water or something? Look at your rivers — if we drink that stuff, full of cadmium, mercury and sulphur and god knows what muck — heaven knows what kind of monsters we’ll morph into and then you’ll have you knickers in a twist again.

What do you think of this plan of allowing tourists 24X7 access into tiger reserves like Ranthambore?

Even our private night life is no longer sacrosanct. Talk about encouraging stalking and voyeurism and peeping Toms… But heh, heh, I think we’ll have ways of dealing with this: all it will take is one deep, bowel-of-the-earth rumbling growl near a Gypsy in the middle of the night and see what happens! How many nappies will need to be changed then! I doubt the wildlife department would help visitors do that or appreciate the stink that’s raised.

There was also this suggestion that a reserve be declared for white tigers so they can breed. What are your views on that?

Well, it’s like in the old days, circuses and fairs used to show off what were then considered freaks — you know — unfortunate people with hare-lips or club-feet, or midgets or giants or just nut cases or bearded ladies. That’s what white tigers are. Did you see that Facebook post of that very unhappy white tiger with a squashed in face? It looked as if it had run into a wall at 90 mph. If you appreciate that sort of thing, well, then we tigers have even less respect for you than we already do.

Everyone’s been raving about the latest Jungle Book film… Have you seen it and what are your views on it?

No, we haven’t seen it and are not going to, but our sentiments are very hurt and we demand it be immediately banned. It shows us in a very poor light, and that is anti-national because we are the national animal after all! In fact, we demand that the book be banned too and be publicly masticated by the publishers. Unfortunately, the author is not alive or we would have demanded a tête-à-tête with him to discuss a few issues regarding rewriting the plot. I mean if Mowgli were raised by Sher Khan and his missus, and hunted by packs of slavering wolves, now that would have made a very interesting story I think. Um, if you know anyone in Bollywood who would be interested, we’d love to audition.

Do you think the Indian lion should replace the tiger as the country’s national animal? Considering it’s only found in Gujarat and they’re on the Ashoka pillar and all that?

Indian lion? Are you serious? What animal is that? Never heard of it! We only know of the Indian loin — and everyone knows what he’s all about!

The names are in pop culture and in history, but how do they relate to the real world?

What exactly is a Chicken Hawk? Or a Sparrow Hawk, or Pigeon Hawk? Or even a Duck Hawk, for that matter?

You don't hear the terms very often any longer, but old bird books actually list those as the commonly accepted names for some species. I have a certain affinity for old bird books and grab them whenever I see them at tag sales, flea markets or used book stores. I found one recently that had listings for Pigeon Hawk, Duck Hawk, and Sparrow Hawk.

Funny thing is, none of them are even hawks -- they are falcons.

In the book ""Birds of America,"" published by Garden City Books in 1917 with T. Gilbert Pearson as editor-in-chief, the Duck Hawk is described as ""a fierce destroyer but a splendid success as a bird."" In the 'Other Names' column under Duck Hawk, the name Peregrine Falcon is listed first, along with American Peregrine, Great-footed Hawk, Wandering Falcon and Tercel.

So the Duck Hawk is the Peregrine Falcon. Or is it? The book further explains that ""the Peregrine Falcon of the Old World is the noble falcon of the days when hawking was the chief of sports. Casually it is found in Greenland but its best known American representative is the Duck Hawk.""

Photo by Chris Bosak Peregrine Falcon. Photo by Chris Bosak Peregrine Falcon. Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close A hawk by any other name ... 1 / 3 Back to Gallery

The entry goes on to explain that coloration of the throat and upper breast are the only differences between the Peregrine Falcon and Duck Hawk. It's safe to say that the Duck Hawk listed in this book is the bird we now know as Peregrine Falcon.

On to the Pigeon Hawk, which follows Duck Hawk in the book. Other names for Pigeon Hawk listed are American Merlin, Bullet Hawk and Little Blue Corporal. So the bird we know as the Merlin is the Pigeon Hawk.

Next is the Sparrow Hawk, which has other names such as American Sparrow Hawk, American Kestrel, Windhover, Rusty-crowned Kestrel, Kitty Hawk, Grasshopper Hawk and Mouse Hawk. Of course, the common name now is the American Kestrel. The kestrel is our smallest and most color falcon.

The author of the Sparrow Hawk entry in the book, R.I Brasher, explains that ""Windhover is a very appropriate name, for they are much given to hovering over field and pastures ... as they scan the ground below for grasshoppers and mice.

So what about the Chicken Hawk? Remember the old Looney Tunes cartoon when the young hawk tries to bring down the comparatively giant rooster Foghorn Leghorn. The young bird brashly refered to itself as a Chicken Hawk. The hip hop/rap/rock band Cypress Hill has a song with the lyrics ""I'm a Chicken Hawk hunting for a chicken.""

The Chicken Hawk is apparently a moniker for several bird species. ""Birds of America"" does not list Chicken Hawk as the official name for any bird, but it is listed as an ""other name"" for Sharp-shinned Hawk, Cooper's Hawk, Goshawk, and Red-tailed Hawk. One theory claims that these birds were nicknamed Chicken Hawk to justify the killing of these birds of prey by farmers.

I love looking through these old books to see how birdwatching and its terminology has changed throughout the years. It's sad when entries for birds that are no longer with us, such as Ivory-billed Woodpecker and Carolina Parakeet, pop up in these books. It does, however, serve as a stark reminder that we need to protect the birds that remain. The world would be a lot more lonely place without our Sparrow Hawks?"~[]

seems the title of having the world's greatest concentration of unique species of mammals goes to the island of Luzon in the Philippines.

A 15-year-long project has shown that out of 56 species of non-flying mammals known to live on the island, 52 can be found nowhere else in the world.

They include 'cloud rats' and tree-dwelling mice with super long whiskers, with 28 of the species identified during the course of the research.

THE CREATURES OF LUZON A 15-year-long project has shown that out of 56 species of non-flying mammals known to live on the island, 52 can be found nowhere else in the world. They include 'cloud rats' and tree-dwelling mice with super long whiskers, with 28 of the species identified during the course of the research. Nineteen of the species have been formally described in scientific journals, and nine are currently 'in the works', according to the team of American and Filipino scientists who combed the island for previously unknown mammals. Luzon also supports 57 species of bats, most of which live in the hot, humid lowlands.

Nineteen of the species have been formally described in scientific journals, and nine are currently 'in the works', according to the team of American and Filipino scientists who combed the island for previously unknown mammals.

'We started our study on Luzon in 2000 because we knew at the time that most of the native mammal species on the island were unique to the island, and we wanted to understand why that is the case,' said Lawrence Heaney, the project's leader, who is the Negaunee Curator of Mammals at The Field Museum in Chicago.

'We did not expect that we would double the number already known.'

Luzon is the largest island in the Philippines, at about 40,000 square miles (103,000 square km).

It has never been connected to any continental land, like Hawaii. But is at least five times older, so the few species that that arrived from the Asian mainland have evolved and diversified with little external influence over thousands of years.

Scientists are fascinated by island-dwelling native species because they showcase a 'sped up' version of evolution.

This is because when animals are closed off from the rest of the world, in places where there are few or no predators or competitors, they are able to branch out into special adaptations, eventually forming new species.

This is the case on Luzon, which also have the advantage of being covered in mountains.

The mountaintops form what scientists call 'sky islands' - little pockets of distinctive habitat that the animals further adapt to.

The tree-dwelling mouse (left) which has whiskers that reach all the way to its ankles, is one of the 28 new species and cloud rats (right) are just some of the 93 percent of Luzon land mammals that are found nowhere else in the world

PHILLIPPINE TREE OF LIFE All 28 of the species discovered during the project are members of two branches on the tree of life that are confined to the Philippines. There are individual mountains on Luzon that have five species of mammals that live nowhere else. That is more unique species on one mountain than live in any country in continental Europe. Luzon also supports 57 species of bats, most of which live in the hot, humid lowlands. These include the golden-crowned flying fox, which is one of the heaviest bats in the world at up to two and a half pounds.

'The animals are isolated high on the scattered mountains, so they inevitably diverge,' Dr Heaney said.

'Given enough time, you begin to see huge biodiversity. In the process of trying to understand how that happens, we doubled the number of known species on Luzon.'

Among the 28 new species discovered by the team are four species of tiny tree-mice with whiskers so long they reach nearly to their ankles and five species of mice that look like shrews and feed primarily on earthworms.

Most of the new species live in tropical cloud forest high in the mountains, where frequent typhoons can drop 12 to 15 feet (four to five metres) of rain every year, according to the study published in the scientific journal Frontiers of Biogeography.

Another, the lesser flat-headed bat, is so tiny that it can roost inside the hollow spaces inside bamboo stems.

Danny Balete, a Research Associate at the Field Museum who is based in the Philippines , said: 'We also wanted to learn more about the conservation status of these wonderful animals.

'The Philippines is one of the most heavily deforested countries in the tropics - only about seven per cent of the old-growth tropical forest is left.

'We learned that quite a few of the species are seriously threatened by habitat loss and over-hunting, but none are yet extinct.'

Luzon has a human population of about 50 million, including about 23 million in greater Manila, the country's capital."~[]

The 28 new discoveries brought the total number of species of non-flying mammals that are now known to live on Luzon to 56.

The researchers were able to determine that 52 of those species occur nowhere else in the world.

A team of researchers has concluded that, in addition to being the Philippines’ largest and most populous island, Luzon Island is also home to the greatest concentration of unique species of mammals in the world.

The team, made up of scientists from the United States and the Philippines, has just concluded a 15-year study on Luzon Island, during which they discovered 28 new species of mammals. The study’s results have been published in the journal Frontiers of Biogeography.

Among the newly encountered species are four tree-mice, tiny creatures with long whiskers that reach nearly to their ankles, as well as five species of mice that look like shrews and primarily feed on earthworms. Most of the new species live in tropical cloud forest high in the mountains, where frequent typhoons can drop four or five meters (12 to 15 feet) of rain per year.

“All 28 of the species we discovered during the project are members of two branches on the tree of life that are confined to the Philippines,” Eric Rickart, a member of the team who is based at the Natural History Museum of Utah, said in a statement.

“There are individual mountains on Luzon that have five species of mammals that live nowhere else. That’s more unique species on one mountain than live in any country in continental Europe. The concentration of unique biodiversity in the Philippines is really staggering.”

The 28 new discoveries brought the total number of species of non-flying mammals that are now known to live on Luzon to 56. The researchers were able to determine that 52 of those species occur nowhere else in the world. In other words, 93 percent of all of the land mammals found on Luzon are endemic to the island.

“We started our study on Luzon in 2000 because we knew at the time that most of the native mammal species on the island were unique to the island, and we wanted to understand why that is the case,” Lawrence Heaney, who is the Negaunee Curator of Mammals at The Field Museum in Chicago and the study’s lead author, said in a statement. “We did not expect that we would double the number already known.”

Heaney and his co-authors explain in the study that Luzon has never been connected to any continental land mass, meaning the species that live there have evolved in isolation, much like the wildlife of Hawaii. But Luzon is much older and, at about 40,000 square miles, much larger than the Hawaiian islands, meaning it has had a lot more time and space for species that arrived from the Asian mainland to evolve and diversify.

Also, Luzon’s mountainous terrain creates what scientists call “sky islands,” mountaintops that provide distinctive types of habitat. “The animals are isolated high on the scattered mountains, so they inevitably diverge. Given enough time, you begin to see huge biodiversity,” Heaney said.

The team also endeavored to learn more about the conservation status of the 57 species of bats that live on Luzon, such as the golden-crowned flying fox, one of the heaviest bats in the world at up to two and a half pounds, and the lesser flat-headed bat, which is so tiny that it can roost inside of bamboo stems.

Danny Balete, a research associate with The Field Museum who is based in the Philippines, noted that the country is one of the most heavily deforested in the tropics, and only about seven percent of the old-growth tropical forest remains. Several of Luzon’s bat species are seriously threatened by habitat loss and over-hunting, though none have yet gone extinct.

“Protecting all of these species from extinction is going to be a big challenge,” Balete said. “The good news is that when the native forest is allowed to regenerate, the native mammals move back in, and the pest rats get kicked out.”

Heaney added that learning about the diversity of mammal species on Luzon is crucial to the success of conservation efforts. “In order to be effective at conserving an environment, we have to know what’s out there.”"~[]

The Asiatic lion once roamed vast swaths of the Middle East and Asia, but indiscriminate hunting and killing to protect livestock led to their mass slaughter. By the late 1800s, as few as 10 of the animals remained on Earth.

Like their African kin, Asiatic lions live in prides, and the females do most of the hunting, taking down prey like antelope. They look much like their cousins, too, though they tend to be slightly smaller than African lions and live in forests instead of open grasslands. They also have a distinctive fold of skin on their stomachs, and their manes are less plush.

“There’s so few conservation success stories when it comes to carnivores,” says Gitanjali Bhattacharya, program manager at the Zoological Society of London’s South and Central Asia programs, “and the Asiatic lion, for me, it’s really a story of hope. Because you’ve got a population that’s growing, a community that’s supportive, and the lion is taking back its former range.”

Lionhearted

Watch Asia's Last Lions by Roshan Patel, featured in National Geographic's Short Film Showcase. The filmmakers created the content presented, and the opinions expressed are their own, not those of National Geographic Partners.

That success can be attributed to the effort of conservation groups and local communities' dedication to protecting the animals. (Read more about National Geographic's Big Cats Initiative.)

The people who live around Gir have a deep respect for the lions and patrol the jungle looking for poachers—though illegal hunting hasn't been a problem for a long time, says Bhattacharya.

They're ""right on top of it, monitoring threats,” she says.

For them, ""the lion is beyond an endangered species,” Bhushan Pandya, member of the Gujarat State Board for Wildlife and Asiatic lion conservationist, says by email. “Lion, the king of jungle, is the symbol of strength and power.”

The predator is also a religious icon in Hinduism; the goddess Durga rides a lion, and the god Narasimha is half lion. (See National Geographic's most stunning pictures of big cats.)

Cats on the Move

Even so, scientists are concerned that disease or natural disaster could wipe out the entire Gir population in one fell swoop. Some Asiatic lions live in zoos worldwide, but there are no plans to release those animals to build a wild population. (Read: ""Lions Approach Extinction in West Africa."")

To avoid this fate, the Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project, an Indian government initiative, plans to capture some Asiatic lions from Gir and relocate them to the Palpur-Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary, located in another state. That way, if anything happens to Gir, there will still be lions in Palpur-Kuno.

That plan has proven controversial, however. Though Pandya supports the idea of translocation, he doesn't think that Palpur-Kuno is a good place for the lions. There isn't enough prey, poaching gangs may be a threat, and tigers—potential competitors—already live in the region, he says. (Read: ""Tiger Got Your Goat? Here’s Who to Call."")

What's more, the Gujarat State Wildlife Department has also objected to moving the animals outside the state, suggesting they would be better off living in two other parks within their state.

Despite such disputes, Bhattacharya hopes that other big cat conservation projects can learn from the Asiatic lion.

two”~"Endangered Amur tigers and Amur leopards are staging a modest recovery in China’s remote northeastern provinces. Over thirty tigers and some 42 leopards now roam the region’s forests.

The big cats’ habitat remains threatened by human encroachment and experts say the amount of forest currently protected is insufficient to support their growing populations.

The government of Jilin Province, where most of the big cats live, has proposed a massive new national park focused on the two species that would connect three existing protected areas.

The park remains under consideration by the central government.

It is rare to spot an Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) in the wild, according to Yang Jun, director of the Hunchun Forestry Bureau’s wildlife protection department. However, on July 19, residents of Machuanzi, a village merely 10 kilometers away from downtown Hunchun in China’s northeastern Jilin Province, informed him that a tiger came to the residential area and ate two dogs on a single day.

Yang went to the village immediately after he heard the news and saw footprints of the tiger and blood stains of its prey just 20 to 30 meters away from a villager’s house. “We then left four foot-bound roosters on the ground near the house for the tiger,” Yang told Mongabay. “The tiger did come back and picked the roosters one by one, four consecutive times, and we took video of the whole process.”

Living inside the buffer zone of Hunchun National Nature Reserve near the border with Russia, most villagers in Machuanzi never encounter a live tiger in their lifetime due to the animal’s scarcity. The villagers set off firecrackers to scare the tiger away, but it seemed unwilling to leave the human domain, where it could easily obtain prey. Yang said the tiger, a sub-adult not yet fully capable of finding its own prey in the wild, remained in a neighboring village about four kilometers from Machuanzi and ate sheep from local’s sheepfold.

Jilin province’s Forestry Department was planning to trap the tiger and send it to a remote forest area away from the villages, Yang told Mongabay in early September. “However, so far the tiger has not yet been successfully trapped,” he added.

Revival

The Amur tiger, a subspecies of tiger also known as the Siberian tiger, is a flagship animal of the boreal forest ecosystem. The subspecies once lived throughout the Russian Far East, northeastern China, and the Korean peninsula, but its population has declined dramatically due to habitat loss and fragmentation, prey scarcity, and poaching. Since the mid eighteenth century, both China and Russia encouraged large-scale migration and development in the region, which led directly to a sharp decline in Amur tigers from more than 3,000 in the late nineteenth century to fewer than 600 in recent decades. The IUCN lists it as endangered.

Between the 1950s and the 1990s, northeastern China served as a major timber source for construction throughout the country, providing 658 million cubic meters of timber between 1949 and 1986, according to official statistics. Excessive land exploitation and unsustainable consumption of large tracts of virgin forest for the sake of development caused the number of Amur tigers surviving in China to dwindle to between 150 and 200 in the 1970s and further to just 16 to 18 in the late 1990s.

Thanks to the two most important forest-protection policies of the Chinese central government — its National Forest Protection Program (NFPP) and its national-level nature reserves — this dire situation started to change. The NFPP was implemented to restrict logging in 1998 in response to deforestation-caused flooding, and Jilin implemented a complete ban on commercial logging in the province in 2015. Statistics released by Jilin’s Forestry Department indicate that forest coverage reached 93.76 billion square kilometers this year, bringing the province’s forest coverage up to nearly 44 percent.

At least three national nature reserves including Hunchun, Wangqing, and Huangnihe were set up in the province around 2001, near the borders of China, Russia, and North Korea. The government established these specifically to protect Amur tigers and Amur leopards (Panthera pardus orientalis). To maintain the integrity of the cats’ habitat, Jilin’s provincial government even canceled a highway project and rerouted a high-speed railway connecting Hunchun city to Russia’s coastal city of Vladivostok.

All these efforts are starting to pay off for the cats. “After more than a decade of conservation efforts, now the number of Amur tigers in China has seen a modest recovery” to more than 30 in total, ecologist Xie Yan from the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Zoology and founder of a conservation NGO called the Global Protected Area Friendly System told Mongabay. “Twenty-seven of them have been tracked in Jilin Province alone. The number is reliable, being obtained through years of monitoring, research, and joint efforts from different research groups and science institutions.”

Four young female tigers should step into adulthood and begin breeding in the coming years, so Chinese experts predict the tiger population will continue to increase. Furthermore, according to Jilin’s Forestry Department, a total of 42 Amur leopards have been spotted in the province. The IUCN considered the subspecies extinct in China in 2007. (The group lists the leopard (Panthera pardus) as vulnerable but has not recently assessed the Amur leopard or the other eight subspecies separately.)

Cat conflicts

In recent years, it has become clear that Hunchun city and its neighborhood function as important corridors linking cat habitats in Russia and China. However, the reality is that the tiger’s habitat is becoming increasingly fragmented and degraded due to human pressure. Hunchun National Nature Reserve, which measures some 5,000 square kilometers (1,930 square miles), is isolated. Various human activities there, including herding, ginseng planting, wood-frog raising, and gold mining have threatened the tiger’s environment.

In addition, Ge Jianping, an ecologist with Beijing Normal University who has studied wild Amur tigers and Amur leopards for decades, told China Daily earlier this year that the number of tigers has exceeded the area’s ecological carrying capacity. According to Ge, the overcrowding could cause a population crash because of pressure on resources.

“An individual female Amur tiger’s territory amounts up to 450 square kilometers, thus a successful recovery of a viable population of 18 female tigers require a minimum of 10,000 square kilometers,” Xie said. “But the current protected area is way too small.”

The strain is starting to show in an unfortunate cycle that is detrimental to people, tigers, and their prey alike. The increasing number of cattle in Hunchun city, to over 40,000, threatens wild ungulates as they consume the same grass. And the decline of the ungulates — the tigers’ and leopards’ natural prey — in turn threatens the big cats. Now tigers are frequently attacking cattle raised by local herders. In Hunchun city alone, the average number of tiger attacks on cattle has surpassed 100 each year.

Since this May, Yin Zhaohai, who owns pastureland in Hunchun city, has lost over 20 cattle, six of them to tigers. “We cannot retaliate against tigers, which are protected animals, but the security of both the cattle and us should be considered,” Yin told Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency, in mid-August.

In 2006, Jilin Province launched a program to compensate people for livestock and grain lost to wildlife. The provincial government will compensate people for 100 percent of the market value of livestock preyed on by tigers and leopards. By 2015, the government spent over 120 million yuan ($18 million) on a total of 37,000 compensation cases for wildlife damage to crops and livestock.

Yang Weihe, the Global Protected Area Friendly System’s Amur tiger project manager, told Mongabay that Jilin’s full compensation program is effective in alleviating conflict between people and big cats. “Otherwise, humans might take retaliatory action, including spraying poisons on the remains of the prey,” Yang said.

Another source of conflict is poaching. According to Xie, despite being strictly prohibited, some locals set wire-loop snares to trap wildlife, such as boar (Sus scrofa) and Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus) in the forests. This both reduces tigers’ prey and directly threatens tigers’ lives. According to media reports, between 2000 and 2010 at least one Amur tiger was killed by a snare, and in January 2016 another was found dead as a result of serious snare wounds on its neck.

Last winter, between September 2015 and January 2016, Hunchun National Nature Reserve cleared 8,250 wire snares within the reserve and Jilin government officers apprehended 314 poachers. Wang Aimin, director of the China program of the New York-based NGO Wildlife Conservation Society, told Mongabay in Beijing in late July that the number of wire loops remaining in the forest is still significant and poses a dire threat to the tigers.

In the opinion of ecologist Jianping, the top priority for the provincial government should be to minimize human activities, including herding and farming, in order to expand the effective habitat available to the two flagship species. He added that anti-poaching and snare clearing missions, as well as the relocation of communities from some key habitat areas, should ideally be completed before this upcoming winter, when it’s more difficult for the big cats to find prey.

“Jilin provincial government has so far made a great effort, yet due to limited financial resources, national-level support is urgently needed to sustain and enhance the conservation effect,” said Ge.

A new park

A planned Amur Tiger and Leopard National Park pilot project aims to draw more national support, both financial and technical, for the protection of the big cats. The Jilin provincial government presented the pilot project plan to the central government for approval this May and a decision is still pending. An inside source who requested anonymity told Mongabay the new national park would extend 14,600 square kilometers (5,640 square miles) to connect and include Hunchun Nature Reserve, nearby Wangqing Nature Reserve in Jilin province, and Laoyeling Nature Reserve in neighboring Heilongjiang Province. It’s a huge area, 60 percent larger than Yellowstone National Park in the U.S.

Xiao Wanjun from Jilin’s Forestry Department told Xinhua in August that the national park is expected to ease human-tiger conflicts. “Local government plans to relocate some existing communities, factories from inside the national park area, so as to avoid conflicts between wildlife and human activities,” he said.

China boasts approximately 10,000 protected areas covering about 18 percent of the country, a proportion higher than the global average. But weak management and insufficient funding are threatening most of the protected areas’ conservation efforts. To revamp the management of all of China’s protected areas, in late 2013 Chinese President Xi Jinping included the development of a true national park system into the central committee’s official plans for deeper reform. Nine pilot parks across the country were announced in June 2015.

This is a crucial moment for Chinese conservation, Yang Rui, head of Tsinghua University’s landscape architecture department and a member of a team of experts appointed by the central government to advise the national park project, told Mongabay. According to Yang, if the new national park system successfully unifies dissenting interest groups and changes the mindsets of local governments that are hungry for economic development, it may be the first step to realizing the central government’s aspiration of a truly ecological civilization.

The central government has pledged that the new national parks will be more effective in managing and protecting land and wildlife than existing protected areas are, but the concept of the new Chinese national park system remains otherwise poorly defined. Ecologists say systemic change is needed before the new national parks can successfully prioritize nature conservation while remaining an educational attraction open to the public.

“Frankly speaking, I still worry about the current national park situation when almost all attempts to build national parks in nine different provinces are still based on attracting tourists and profit,” Yang said. “If national parks are blindly built before national park reform is concretely defined, the results would be disastrous.”

During a recent interview with Mongabay, Chen Jin, Director of Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden in Yunnan Province, also cautioned that in building a national parks system from scratch, the government should enact strict legal protections for the parks. Otherwise, without effective restriction by national law, short-term protections might give way to local governments’ development ambitions in the long run.

Just how the Amur Tiger and Leopard National Park will function has yet to be clarified, but experts say it would represent a significant step in protecting the charismatic cats. Ecologist Xie of the Chinese Academy of Sciences commented that building a new national park larger than 10,000 square kilometers that connects now-separated protected areas is crucially meaningful for Amur tiger and leopard conservation. She emphasized the importance of community protection efforts, pointing out that it is impossible to relocate all the people who now live inside the proposed national park boundaries.

“10,000 square kilometers is merely the present necessary habitat for the tiger population, and with the revival of the tiger population, it would be likely that local communities would coexist with roaming tigers in a large area amounting to 30,000 or even up to 300,000 square kilometers in the future,” she said. “So both humans and the tiger need to learn how to live together in a peaceful way.”

According to Wang of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s China program, it is those locals who would learn the best routines and habits for living with their tiger neighbors. “It is very important for the community to make a balancing demarcation line and follow some principles to avoid direct conflicts with their neighbors,” he said. “The goal is to attain a harmonious dynamic state between the two.”"~[]

Bushmeat has long been a traditional source of food for many rural people, but as roads have been driven into remote areas, large-scale commercial hunting is leaving forests and other habitats devoid of wildlife.

The scientists behind the new analysis warned that, without action, the wiping out of these species could lead to the collapse of the food security of hundreds of millions of people reliant on bushmeat for survival.

The work comes against the backdrop of the natural world undergoing the greatest mass extinction since a giant meteorite strike wiped out the dinosaurs 65m years ago, with species vanishing far more rapidly than the long term rate, driven by the destruction and invasion of wild areas by humans and their livestock and hunting.

The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, used the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) red list to identify the endangered land mammals that are primarily at risk from hunting for food. They found 301 such species, representing 7% of all the land mammals assessed by IUCN and about a quarter of all endangered mammals. Other mammals are threatened by habitat loss or hunting for other reasons, such as elephants which are poached for their ivory.

The 301 species include 168 primates, such as the lowland gorilla and mandrill, 73 hoofed animals, such as the wild yak and bactrian camel, 27 bats, such as the golden-capped fruit bat and the black-bearded flying fox, and 12 carnivores, such as the clouded leopard and several bear species.

There are also 26 marsupials threatened by meat hunting, including the grizzled tree kangaroo, and 21 rodent species, such as the Sulawesi giant squirrel and the alpine woolly rat. All eight species of pangolins - scaly anteaters - are threatened and these species won top-level protection at the recent summit of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species.

“There are a plenty of bad things affecting wildlife around the world and habitat loss and degradation are clearly at the forefront, but among the other things is the seemingly colossal impact of bushmeat hunting,” said Prof David Macdonald, at the University of Oxford and part of the international team that produced the research. “You might rejoice at having some habitat remaining, say a pristine forest, but if is hunted out to become an empty larder, it is a pyrrhic victory.”

He said: “The number of hunters involved has gone up, and the penetration of road networks into the remotest places is such that there is no refuge left. So it becomes commercially possible to make a trade out of something that was once just a rabbit for the pot. In places like Cameroon, where I have worked, you see flotillas of taxis early in the morning going out to very remote areas and being loaded up with the [bushmeat] catch and taken back to towns.”

The scale of the global bushmeat trade is difficult to measure but, in 2011, the Center for International Forestry Research estimated 6m tonnes of animals were taken each year. Another estimate indicates 89,000 tonnes of meat, worth $200m, is taken every year from the Brazilian Amazon. The meat is also smuggled abroad, with 260 tonnes of wild meat per year estimated to be hidden in personal baggage at just one European airport, Paris Charles de Gaulle.

Bushmeat is often caught using long lines of snares, which trap animals indiscriminately. Macdonald, who works with the lions in Hwange park in Zimbabwe where Cecil the lion lived, has seen lions killed by snares set for game species.

The extinction of the threatened mammals would also irrevocably upset the balance of many ecosystems. For example, they include predators that keep rodents in check, species vital for dispersing seeds and others such as bats that pollinate flowers.

“With this [hunting] trend, the loss of mammal populations thus affects the livelihoods and food security for hundreds of millions of rural people across the globe,” the scientists warned.

Macdonald said: “You have got to distinguish between those people who have no choice but to eat bushmeat, and what is to be done for them, and people now living in towns who have a nostalgic memory for the time when they lived on bushmeat, but no longer need to, so it is a luxury.”

The researchers said solving the problem of over-hunting will require greater legal protection for the species, empowering local communities to benefit from wildlife conservation, providing alternative foods and better education and family planning to curb population growth."~[]

Rainforest Trust is delighted to announce that over 100,000 acres of rainforest encompassing and surrounding Cleopatra’s Needle, one of Palawan’s highest peaks, were just declared as a Forest Reserve due to the collaborative efforts of Rainforest Trust’s local conservation partner Centre for Sustainability-PH working with the Puerto Princesa city government.

This forest harbors incredible concentrations of endemic and endangered wildlife, and until the recent declaration was one of Palawan’s most threatened ecosystems due to pressures from logging, hunting and rapid urbanization. Of the species that reside only on the island of Palawan and nowhere else in the world, 85 percent are found on and around Cleopatra’s Needle; with that amount of rare species dependent on Palawan’s natural environment, the protection of its rainforest has been a conservation priority of global importance.

The southern and eastern hills of Cleopatra’s Needle are home to a population of the Endangered Palawan Horned Frog, and nearby creeks contain the largest remaining population of the Vulnerable Philippine Flat-headed Frog. The Endangered Palawan Toadlet was rediscovered in 2015 in Cleopatra’s Needle, after not being observed for over 40 years.

Nearly 60 terrestrial mammal species have been recorded in Palawan, including the Endangered Philippine Pangolin, Vulnerable Palawan Bearcat and Asian Small-clawed Otter. Of 279 bird species found on Palawan, 27 are endemic to the Philippines, such as the Palawan Hornbill whose population is declining due hunting and the loss of lowland forest elsewhere on the island. In total, 31 threatened species inhabit the forests of Cleopatra’s Needle.

In addition to providing a haven for species that are at-risk for extinction, the reserve will also protect territory for a local indigenous group, the Batak tribe. Originally from Papua New Guinea and thought to be among the first humans to settle in the Philippines, the Batak people now reside in small villages and sustainably harvest a variety of forest products such as tree resins and honey.

“The reserve will protect the Philippine’s last 200 members of the Batak tribe and will safeguard the area from outside logging, maintaining their traditional lands and clean water supply,” said Rainforest Trust’s CEO Dr. Paul Salaman.

As part of the declaration process for the Cleopatra’s Needle Forest Reserve, a management plan was created, forest guard training courses were implemented and ecotourism activities are to be introduced to improve the livelihood of the Batak tribe.

This project was made possible thanks to the efforts of our local partner in Palawan as well as the generous support of Luanne Lemmer, Eric Veach, Brett Byers, Leslie Santos and many other friends of Rainforest Trust and in partnership with Global Wildlife Conservation.

Rainforest Trust continues to safeguard rainforests in the Philippines through our appeal to save the last critical habitats on Dinagat Island.

Recognized as a Key Biodiversity Area and last stronghold for the Giant Golden-crowned Flying Fox and Dinagat Bushy-tailed Cloud Rat, Dinagat Island is totally unprotected and is under imminent threat from a proposed massive mining operation."~[]

like to begin by saying that all animals are wonderful in their own way. But today we’re here to discuss and judge a particular subset known as “It” Animals. You know what I’m talking about even if you think you don’t: “It” animals are a class of creature who’ve so thoroughly infiltrated your psyche that you wake up one morning to realize you’ve become “the girl who loves deer.” (This is why you’ve mounted a whitewashed deer bust with gold antlers to your bedroom wall, why the centerpiece on your dining room table is a chic mess of wooden antlers, and why your phone case bears a deers-in-scarves design. Deer have “it.”)

It’s often tough to call which animals fall into this category—there is no rubric for deciding which animals have more of “it” or less of “it,” and yet there is a conclusive delineation. Think about it: We’ve come to an unspoken agreement that Komodo Dragons do not have “it.” They are fascinating, to be sure, but will they ever merit an Etsy shop rife with Komodo Dragon paraphernalia including (but not limited to) keychains, necklaces, graphic coffee mugs (“Komodon’t Talk To Me Before I’ve Had Caffeine!”), door stops, quilts, frilly baby underwear, etc.? Hard to say, but no.

What we do know is that there are 13 animals who do have “it.” But even within that elite grouping, some of those animals are more “it” than others (this is not an opinion. It is a fact). Here is a definitive ranking of the most “it” animals, as determined by ubiquity, preciousness, a cultural relevance that has transcended their species, Hollywood appeal, and, for at least one, business savvy.

13. Owl



Owls have many things going for them. They can rotate their heads 270 degrees. They aren’t afraid to ask the tough questions. They are at the center of a devastating Harry Potter plot point. But their omnipresence is so overwhelming that they have, in turn, become obsolete. Once an animal has had a set of crocheted fingerless mittens made in its likeness—which, due to the lack of a finger pocket or a thumbhole, are really just arm warmers or maybe soft casts—they are relegated to the bottom of the “it” pile.

Penned on behalf of Professor McGonagall by props concept artist Miraphora Mina, a number of the letters sent to Harry had to be printed on paper light enough for real owls to carry; and for the scene in which a blizzard of letters blasts through the living room at Privet Drive, ten thousand envelopes were printed on even lighter paper (the kind used for bank notes) so that they could be easily blown all over the place. #TriviaTuesday #HarryPotter @MinaLimaDesign A photo posted by Harry Potter Film (@harrypotterfilm) on Jan 27, 2015 at 2:55pm PST

12. Crab



At best, crabs are flown in from Alaska and served with drawn butter. At worst, they are referred to as “pubic lice.” At mediocre, they’re the crux of an interior decor scheme at your mom’s book club leader’s lake house.

11. Hamster



There is little more soothing than watching a tiny hamster eat tiny foods, like burritos or carrot slices. But sometimes, they also eat their own babies. So.

10. Llama



The llama is a fame-whore. (Things to consider: Disney’s The Emperor’s New Groove; Napoleon Dynamite, which forever ruined the lives of Tinas everywhere thanks to the line, “Tina, you fat lard, come get some dinner”; that video of two llamas running through a retirement community in Arizona; that one sweater J. Crew made a few years ago.) Nobody likes a fame-whore. Conversely, The Emperor’s New Groove is one of the most underrated movies of all time, and I own that J. Crew sweater.

9. White-Tailed Deer



Riding the Bambi wave since 1942 with impressive longevity. Less-cool cousin to the animals responsible for delivering presents to the entire world on Christmas Eve.

8. Mini Pig



“Mini” makes everything better: Candy bars (less calories), malls (less agoraphobia), golf (less general embarrassment, in theory). Mini pigs are, irrefutably, better.

This pig is eating an ice cream at a tiny picnic table. Now there is no reason not smile! Have a good Saturday nerds pic.twitter.com/dmCOMRw9I6 — Kennedy Schofield (@YourPalKennedy) April 6, 2014

7. French Bulldog



A descendant of the English Bulldog, Frenchies are loyal and don’t like to exercise, making them better company than most romantic partners. Pros: So ugly they’re cute. Cons: Gassy. Extra easy to love when they’re on candy dishes, Instagram, and table lamps.

6. Fox



A broadcasting company. One half of a phrase used to describe silver-haired men. A fantastic character in literature. A uniting force (two animated foxes—the title character in Disney’s Robin Hood and Zootopia’s Nick Wilde—bridge a cultural chasm by providing common conversational ground). When it comes to fox goods, never buy this cowl, but consider this punny mug.

5. Otter



Essentially mini sea lions (See: mini pigs). The Otters Holding Hands search results on YouTube are canon.

4. Sloth



You think you know about sloths, but you have no idea. They’re named for one of the Seven Deadly Sins because “they’re lazy.” In reality, their slowness is a metabolic adaptation to conserve energy. Their fur is basically its own ecosystem, hosting everything from symbiotic algaes to moths. They literally can’t stop smiling. No one gives them enough fanfare, except Kristen Bell.

He even smiles when he sleeps! 😍 #slothmfnation #slothinc #savethesloths #sloth A photo posted by Sloth Nation (@slothmfnation) on Apr 8, 2016 at 7:55am PDT

3. Red Panda



Scholars refer to Red Pandas as the “lesser panda” in comparison to Giant Pandas. But Desiigner‘s “Panda,” the art for which is a Giant Panda wearing gold chains, is the worst. Red Pandas will now be referred to as the more panda.

2. Whale



Whales have managed to monetize their majesty in a way few ocean-dwellers have. Artistic renderings of whales are often cartooney and adorable, unlike their real-life counterparts. The whole charade adds to their mystique an thus their overall “it”-ness, but they also reached peak “it” a few years ago. Which leads us to…

1. Swan



Despite an omnipresence that spans eons—Tchaikovsky was on the swan train back in 1875—we are always drawn back to the swan because of its humble origin story. Was there ever an animal so relatable? We were all ugly ducklings at one point, and so we commiserate with the swan’s early plight and subsequent triumph. The swan is unassuming yet regal, approachable yet formal. The crook of their neck gives them a posture of humility, meaning they aren’t too good to be printed on your clothes or even your (my) nails. And now, they are experiencing yet another resurgence: Pool floaties. Blouses. Paper products. Once you get wise to their “it” factor, it’s impossible to avoid full-blown, lasting obsession.

level~"By now, many people have come to recognize that humans have drastically altered the environment — so much so that the planet’s climate is changing and thousands of species are faced with extinction. Habitat loss and pollution are the prime drivers of biodiversity loss but some might be surprised to learn the bushmeat trade has also a significant contribution. I say ‘surprising’ because, after all, food is more plentiful today than it ever was.

I say ‘surprising’ because, after all, food is more plentiful today than it ever was. There’s no shortage of produce, let alone meat. If your heart so desires you can eat chicken, beef or pork almost anywhere and cheap, too. Now, eating meat (every day) is anything but sustainable, but it sure beats shooting wildebeest for grub.

Some people, however, are no longer content with eating ‘regular’ meat. The last decade has seen a surge in bushmeat trade, new study finds, driven in part by the new wealthy elite coming out of developing Asian countries. Some of the delicacies on their menu include more than 300 species of animals currently faced by extinction at the hand of unregulated or illegal hunting.

These animals range from large ones like the grey ox, Bactrian camels, bearded and warty pigs, to small ones like the golden-capped fruit bat, black-bearded flying fox and Bulmer’s fruit bat

“This global bushmeat hunting crisis is a fundamentally distressing problem to address because it is intimately tied to human development challenges such as food insecurity, emergent disease risks and land-use changes. While many ethnic groups have hunted wildlife for subsistence over millennia, often with highly detrimental effects, the unsustainablility of this practice has accelerated in many areas due to growing human populations, an increasing tendency for wild meat to be traded commercially, and the widespread adoption of firearms and motorized transport that increase the efficiency and spatial extent of hunting,” the researchers wrote in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

These species are hunted for meat, medicine, body parts, trophies or live pets. According to the report, 126 species (more than any other group) are threatened by hunting. These include the lowland gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo and many species of lemurs and monkeys.

According to the report, “an estimated 89,000 metric tons of meat with a market value of about $200 million are harvested annually in the Brazilian Amazon, and exploitation rates in the Congo basin are estimated to be five times higher….” Many locals depend on hunting for their protein and livelihoods. This results in concentrated overhunting in areas where there are little alternatives (agriculture, jobs, etc.).

However, most of the meat that comes from killed endangered animals isn’t meant for subsistence. Instead, it winds up in markets and, later, in restaurants where they’re sold as a delicacy. Previously, a report found five tons of bushmeat are smuggled weekly in tourist luggage through the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris.

Then, there’s the slaughter of many individuals for body parts that supposedly have a ‘therapeutic’ value.

Poaching of black and white rhinos in South Africa has jumped in the last couple of years following reports in Southeastern Asia that rhino horn had cured a VIP of terminal liver cancer. Needless to say, there’s no scientific evidence that suggests rhino horn powder or its derivatives have any therapeutic purpose in treating cancer, impotence or any other circulated claim. The water buffalo is considered an alternative to rhino horn in the treatment of conditions ranging from fever to convulsions; the demand has stretched populations very thin, which nowadays only number a few thousand individuals at best. Tiger skins, bones, teeth and claws are also used in traditional medicine.

“Our goal is to raise awareness of this global crisis. Many of these animals are at the brink of extinction. The illegal smuggling in wildlife and wildlife products is run by dangerous international networks and ranks among trafficking in arms, human beings and drugs in terms of profits.”

The authors of the study present a couple of suggestions that might curb the illegal trade of bushmeat.

Laws could be changed to increase penalties for poaching and illegal trafficking and to expand protected habitats for endangered mammals.

Property rights could be provided to communities that benefit from the presence of wildlife.

Food alternatives can help shift consumption to more sustainable species, especially protein-rich plant foods.

Education could help consumers in all countries understand the threats to mammals that are hunted or trapped.

Assistance in family planning could help relieve pressure on wildlife in regions where women want to delay or avoid pregnancy.

That being said, many countries where bushmeat is either sourced or traded already have laws and penalties in place; the problem lies in how these are implemented. In Malaysia, for instance, those caught eating pangolin meat are liable to an RM5,000 fine (~USD1,100). But even heavy fines such as this don’t stop locals and some tourists, especially from China, from dining out on the meat of endangered animals.

Speaking to the Daily Express, a spokesman from the Wildlife Watchers of Sabah said bush meat trade is continuing in the Nabawan district of Malaysia.

“Basically, in a nutshell, the Director was saying that they had managed to solve the illegal wildlife poaching and trade issues that have plagued Nabawan for years.” “Thus with cautious anticipation of this very good news for wildlife conservation, we decided to visit the Nabawan Tamu to see for ourselves how factual was the Wildlife Department’s report.” “Dreadfully to our horror it was brisk business as usual at Nabawan Tamu with a multitude of many different species of wildlife being sold, including barking deer, binturongs, civet cats and even porcupines,” he said.

While it’s true millions of people around the world depend on subsistence hunting for their livelihoods, the bulk of wildlife loss can be attributed to urban use. The authors of the study stress that bold leadership and coordinated effort is required to dampen the illegal bushmeat trade, which has already reached sickening levels."~[]

While many of these bats haven’t even been assessed by the IUCN, 7 are known to be Critically Endangered, 15 are Endangered and 44 are Vulnerable.

The bumblebee bat roosts in caves in Thailand and Myanmar. While population estimates have risen recently due to the discovery of new populations, this small bat is Vulnerable. Its roosting caves and forest habitat are being disrupted by people.

Bats worldwide are understudied and also unloved, partly due to poor public perceptions perpetuated by hundreds of horror movies with their portrayals of bloodsucking bats. The truth is that bats are incredibly beneficial to humans, eating prodigious amounts of insect pests.

One of the most fascinating facts about the bumblebee bat is that its two geographically separated populations in Thailand and Myanmar might currently be undergoing speciation, a process scientists would like to observe. Of course, that won’t happen if nothing is done to keep this tiny mammal from going extinct.

It’s a hummingbird… it’s a bumblebee… it’s Kitti’s hog-nosed bat. Yes, seriously, look at it: it’s a bat. A teensy, tiny, teeny, weeny bat.

Kitti’s hog-nosed bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai) is debatably the world’s smallest mammal and most definitely the world’s smallest bat. Informally known as the bumblebee bat, Kitti’s hog-nosed bat is about the size of a large bumblebee, weighing in at just two grams — about the weight of two Skittles. Again, seriously. It’s also just one of around 440 bat species found in Asia — a continent that houses more than one third of the world’s 1,200 bat species.

“It is [an] incredibly tiny creature — even smaller than my thumb (though I have small hands already),” researcher Pipat Soisook told Mongabay.

A well-known bat expert (a chiropterologist), Soisook is the mammal curator at the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Natural History Museum in Thailand, one of only two countries where Kitti’s hog-nosed bat, or the bumblebee bat, lives. Myanmar is the other.

Soisook has had the pleasure of seeing many bumblebee bats in the wild, where they generally live in small colonies; they refrain from crowding together like many other bat species. When you see the bats in a cave, he said, these miniature mammals “just look like black spots on the cave wall, and you may not realize they are actually bats without going in close enough.”

Even museum specimens of the species impress. Emma Teeling, with University College Dublin, said that when she has examined species specimens she “was blown away by its perfection and small size.”

The bumblebee bat is important for another reason: it’s utterly unique. This single species alone represents an entire family of bats, the Craseonycteridae, which split from the rest some 33 million years ago.

Downlisted, with caveats

For 12 years, the bumblebee bat was listed as Endangered by the IUCN Red List, but in 2008 it was downlisted to Vulnerable due in part to the discovery of new populations, including ones across the Thai border in Myanmar.

Surveys from 1997-2008 counted around 10,000 bats in 44 caves in western Thailand and five caves in Myanmar. The total population may be considerably higher, however, with researchers estimating the Thai population at around 45,000 individuals in a 2009 study presented in the journal Endangered Species Research.

No one knows how many might live in Myanmar, since a more thorough survey there could not be conducted due to security issues. But experts believe the Myanmar population is probably quite small due to the bat’s specific microhabitat requirements.

While these new higher population estimates are good news for the planet’s tiniest bat, caveats remain. Scientists believe that the populations in Myanmar and Thailand are not geographically interconnected, with both genetic and echolocation research showing them to be quite different from each other. The two groups may even represent separate subspecies or species. If that is determined to be the case someday, then the new population total would need to be split into two unequal parts. Soisook, however, goes on to point out that the Myanmar and Thai bat populations — while separated by topography — are still presently morphologically (physically) alike.

“We probably cannot assign them as [being] different species [as yet], but we know that they are at least under an ongoing speciation process,” he explained. That, in itself,

presents scientists with a fascinating opportunity: they may be able to study a mammal undergoing the split into two species, or subspecies. But for that to happen, of course, conservationists need to insure neither population vanishes.

As go the bat caves, so go the bumblebee bats

This tiny bat is threatened by human disruptions both inside its roosting caves, and in the forests where it forages. Conservationists say that monks using the caves for meditation, drug users escaping to caves for a fix, and tourists driven by the desire to see the bats, have all negatively impacted the species. Indeed, some grottos have been turned into “show caves,” leading to the destruction of bat habitat.

“Ecotourism should be fine when tourists do not destroy or modify natural habitat,” explained Soisook. “However, in most cases, when promoting a cave as a tourist attraction [guides] usually modify the cave to make it more comfortable for the tourists.”

If tourists venture into the caves to see the bats, then some impact is unavoidable, according to Soisook. The best way to mitigate this damage, he added, is to only allow tourists into “some big caves where human activities will not change micro-habitat much.” The number of tourists allowed into the various caves should also be regulated.

He noted that smoke inside the caves — whether from meditating monks or drug users — could significantly harm the bats. One small piece of good news: in Myanmar, monks have become cave protectors. The monks usually only use the cave entrances, and their presence tends to keep others away, including hunters, drug addicts and even mining companies that would destroy the caves for cement production.

The bat, which was only discovered by scientists in 1974, has also been impacted by scientific collection, and also by their sale as souvenirs to tourists willing to pay for them.

Outside the caves, rapid deforestation due to logging, agricultural expansion and the growth of human communities, remains the major conservation concern, a reality for many vanishing species all across Asia.

The bumblebee bat is legally protected in Thailand, and a portion of its habitat is protected by parks. But much more needs to be done to adequately conserve the species. Conservationists have recommended improved protection and management of its roosting caves as well as broader protection of its foraging areas.

Asia is home not only to the smallest bat, but the largest too. Found in the Philippines, the golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus) is not just a juggernaut HOW BIG IS IT?, but is one of the continents’ most threatened bats, currently listed as Endangered. And it is not alone.

Of the 442 Asian bat species assessed by the IUCN Red List, seven are listed as Critically Endangered, 15 as Endangered, and 44 as Vulnerable. This means 14 percent of bats on the continent are currently considered threatened. But that is likely a major underestimate.

Seventy-one species (16 percent) of bats in Asia are listed as Data Deficient — more than all the species listed as threatened. Data Deficient simply means that scientists don’t know enough about these species to make an accurate assessment. Unfortunately, such statistics are not an anomaly when it comes to bats.

Ongoing research by Jessica Welch, a PhD student at the University of Tennessee, has determined that nearly 200 species of bat are listed as Data Deficient worldwide and, even more will likely be added to that list — 168 additional species have yet to be evaluated at all by science.

Micaela Jemison, the Director of Communication at Bat Conservation International, an NGO, observed that “we know relatively little” about bats in general, including species in Asia. “Bats are one of the hardest species to monitor, with their often cryptic natures and ability to fly long distances.”

Why we don’t love ‘em, but why we need ‘em

Bats also suffer from a low public profile, and, sadly, from a negative public image largely due to extreme misinformation (think Horror films and blood-sucking vampire bats). As a result, these highly beneficial species — they eat prodigious quantities of insect pests — see little conservation funding compared to many other mammals.

Our ignorance about bats extends to whether their populations are rising or falling worldwide. According to Welch, 635 species of bat lack a trend-line, making establishing conservation priorities incredibly difficult. Welch is currently working on a project to help identify bats in need of more immediate conservation attention.

“I prioritize bats for future research according to the estimated research effort [giving more attention to less studied bats, for example], extinction risk, and evolutionary distinctiveness (i.e., how ‘different’ they are from related species given shared ancestry),” she wrote in an email to Mongabay, noting that her project findings will be ready for publication in 2017.

In Asia, bats are facing many of the same threats as other mammals: especially habitat loss and overhunting.

“Deforestation and the loss of associated roosting and foraging habitat is a major threat to Asian bats, as some countries have lost more than 80 percent of their primary forest cover due to over-exploitation of timber and land conversion for agriculture,” noted Jemison, who added that “bats in the region are also at risk from hunting for local consumption or for shipment to other countries where bat meat is considered a rare delicacy.”

Part of Bat Conservation International’s mission is to change the perceptions of bats by relying on hard numbers that show how important bats are to the environment and local economies, and then relaying those facts to the public.

“In Southeast Asia, bats are the farmers of the rainforests that many communities rely on,” Jemision explained. “Fruit bats are important seed dispersers for rainforest environments, moving seeds over cleared areas where birds and other mammals don’t dare venture. Many nectar-feeding bats are critical pollinators for a wide variety of plants of great economic and ecological value.”

Insectivore bats play a major role in pest control in the region, she said, citing research on the cacao industry in Indonesia. “Without bats, the cacao yield would be reduced by 22 percent. At today’s market cost, [that] would be a loss of $832 million to the industry!”

Sometimes, it’s good to be small

In many ways, the bumblebee bat is lucky compared to other Asian bats. It has been the focus of a number of studies, and scientists have a general idea of how it’s faring. This can be attributed to its teensy, tiny, teeny, weeny-ness: which has captured the imagination of scientists, conservations and even the public.

Many other Asian bats — including Critically Endangered species — remain little known and little protected on the continent. This is probably best highlight by the fact that new bats are still being discovered around Asia with some regularity.

Just last year, Soisook led a team that uncovered a new species of bat from Borneo and Thailand. Dubbed Francis’ woolly horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus francisi), the species was first collected in 1983, but it took more than twenty years for anyone to realize it was an as-yet undescribed species.

R. francisi has not yet been assessed by the IUCN Red List, but it’s very likely threatened and maybe near extinction: Francis’ woolly horseshoe bat has only been recorded by researchers six times.

If Asia’s bats — including Francis’ woolly horseshoe bat, the golden-crowned flying fox, and, of course, the bumblebee bat – are to survive, then they urgently need to be given more attention. Research and funding must target their conservation specifically.

The world needs to learn to love bats, from the smallest to the largest, and it needs to cultivate that love affair with these misunderstood creatures of the night now.

charismatic mammal is covered in fur the color of cinnamon, which keeps it warm in cooler climates. Found in parts of Asia, red pandas are losing ground due to their specific habitat needs for their food staple, bamboo, that grows in areas becoming more and more disturbed by human activity.

Red pandas are small mammals with long, fluffy tails and red and white markings. Though they share a name with the more famous giant panda, they are not closely related. In fact, the name 'panda' was first applied to these animals, and not to the larger black-and-white bear.

According to the San Diego Zoo, Frédéric Cuvier, a French zoologist, first described the red panda in 1825, about 48 years before the giant panda was cataloged. He called it the most beautiful animal he had ever seen and named it Ailurus fulgens, meaning fire-colored, or shining, cat. The common name, panda, may be derived from a Nepalese name for these animals, nigalya ponya, which may have meant 'bamboo footed.' The giant panda was given its name later because of similarities to the red panda.

Other names for the red panda include lesser panda, cat-bear, bear-cat, Himalayan raccoon, fox bear and firefox, according to the San Diego Zoo. The mascot of the Firefox Web browser is a red panda, according to Mozilla.

Red pandas were at first classified as relatives of raccoons in the Procyonidae family, because of physical similarities, such as the head, teeth and ringed tail, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo. Later, because of some DNA similarities, they were classified as bears in the Ursidae family. Recent genetic research now places them in their own family, Ailuridae. They have no living relatives, and their nearest fossil ancestors lived 3 million to 4 million years ago.

Size and description

Red pandas are similar in size to the common house cat. They are 20 to 26 inches (51 to 66 centimeters) long from head to rump, and their tail adds another 10 to 20 inches (25.4 to 51 cm). They weigh from 10 to 20 lbs. (4.5 to 9 kilograms).

Red pandas have large round heads and short snouts with large, pointed ears. Their coats are reddish-brown, although their faces are mostly white with reddish 'tear tracks' extending from their eyes to the corner of their mouths. These markings may help keep the sun out of their eyes, according to the National Zoo.

They have long, bushy tails with alternating red and white rings. The tail helps them maintain their balance as they climb trees. Long, sharp claws help them climb to the highest branches to sunbathe or escape from predators, according to the San Diego Zoo.

One feature that red pandas do share with giant pandas is a modified wrist bone that acts like a thumb, helping them grasp bamboo when feeding, according to the National Zoo.

Habitat and diet

Red pandas live in the mountains of Nepal, central China and northern Myanmar in rainy, high-altitude temperate forests and tropical forests, according to the National Zoo.

One important factor to their habitat is bamboo. The forest must have a bamboo understory for it to be viable for the red panda. Bamboo consists of 85 to 95 percent of their diet, according to the National Zoo. Red pandas eat bamboo shoots and bamboo leaf tips, stripping them off the stems with their mouths. They may also forage for roots, grasses and fallen fruits. Sometimes, they will eat eggs, insects, birds and small mammals as well, but they mostly stick to bamboo.

While it is a big part of their diet, red pandas can digest only about 24 percent of the bamboo they eat. They need to consume 20 to 30 percent of their body weight, or about 2 to 4 lbs. (1 to 2 kg) of bamboo shoots and leaves per day. One study found that female red pandas eat about 20,000 bamboo leaves a single day, according to the San Diego Zoo.

Habits

Red pandas are primarily crepuscular — active at dawn or dusk — but they can be active any time of the day, according to the National Zoo. They are solitary creatures; males are territorial and will mark their territory with strong odor from the scent gland at the base of their tail. Like skunks, red pandas can unleash the smell when they are scared to fend off a predator. If that doesn't work, they stand on their back feet and strike out with the claws on their front feet, according to the San Diego Zoo.

These creatures spend most of their time in trees, eating and sleeping without the need to step foot on soil. They also like to lie on branches to sunbathe as they sleep. It can get a bit chilly at night where the red pandas live, so to keep warm, they wrap themselves in their fluffy tails, according to National Geographic. When temperatures drop significantly, red pandas can become dormant. Their metabolic rate gets lower and increases only every few hours to wake them up so they can look for food, according to the National Zoo.

When they wake up, red pandas groom themselves like cats, according to the San Diego Zoo. They lick their front paws and use them to wipe down their fur instead of a full tongue-to-fur bath, though.

Offspring

Female red pandas give birth during the spring and summer after a gestation period of 114 to 145 days, according to the National Zoo, although it may be as short as 90 days and as long as 158 days. Females build birthing dens in stumps, hollow trees or rock crevices. Dens are lined with grass, leaves, twigs, moss and small branches.

Females can have one to four young, though they usually have twins, according to the San Diego Zoo. The baby red pandas are called cubs. Cubs' eyes and ears are sealed until they are around 2 to 3 weeks of age. They nurse until they are 13 to 22 weeks old. They stay with their mothers in their birthing dens for about 90 days and reach maturity at 18 to 20 months. A typical life span for a red panda is 8 to 10 years in the wild and 15 years in zoos.

Classification

Here is the taxonomy of the red panda, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS):

Kingdom: Animalia Subkingdom: Bilateria Infrakingdom: Deuterostomia Phylum: Chordata Subphylum: Vertebrata Infraphylum: Gnathostomata Superclass: Tetrapoda Class: Mammalia Subclass: Theria Infraclass: Eutheria Order: Carnivora Suborder: Caniformia Family: Ailuridae Genus and species: Ailurus fulgens Subspecies: Ailurus fulgens fulgens (found in the Himalayas), Ailurus fulgens refulgens (found in China)

Some taxonomists, as well as the ITIS and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), recognize two subspecies, while others argue for two separate species: the Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (Ailurus stanyi).

Conservation status

The red panda is considered endangered and is on the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species. It is believed that the population has decreased by 50 percent over the past 18 years, and the decline is projected to continue and perhaps intensify in the next three generations. The number of adults in the wild is probably about 10,000 animals, according to the San Diego Zoo, although some estimates put the number at only 2,500.

The population decline is almost solely due to deforestation. Hunting also seems to be increasing, the IUCN says, perhaps partly in response to the increasing number of 'cute' images on social media. There are now worldwide efforts to protect the red panda, according to the San Diego Zoo. In China, there are 35 protected areas; in India, there are 20. There are eight in Nepal and five in Bhutan.

That’s the good news.

The not-so-good news, the report concludes, is that massive infrastructure projects such as railways and high-speed road corridors, as well as industrial, port and mining activities, are beginning to affect the only habitat of the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) and are a major cause of concern for their future.

“During the last five decades (1965–2015), the approach for the Asiatic lion’s conservation is one of the best efforts in the world. Unlike other super predators, the number of lions has increased fourfold and (that of) wild ungulates by over thirteen-fold in the Gir forest,"" said the analysis authored by H.S. Singh.

“Expansion and consolidation of the Gir protected area, habitat of the Asiatic lion, and response of prey and predator to the management and dispersion trend of lions outside the Gir forests are interesting and noteworthy. The distribution range of lions has also expanded to a large landscape in four districts in the state,"" the report said.

In May 2015, the Gujarat government released its latest lion census figures, which said Gir’s Asiatic lion population had grown around 27%, from 411 in 2010 to 523 in 2015.

Asiatic lions, found only in Gujarat, have been classified as an endangered species.

The study explained that the Gir wildlife sanctuary, the first protected area (PA) in Gujarat, was established in 1965 to conserve the Asiatic lion. Subsequently, the core area of the sanctuary was declared a national park, while the sanctuary was expanded to cover peripheral forests. The adjoining area, an integral part of the Gir forest in Amreli district, was declared as the Pania sanctuary. The wastelands and community lands around Gir were notified as protected forests. A patch of forest near Gir in Mitiyala, historically known as a lion habitat, was declared a sanctuary for further consolidation of its habitat. In 2007, Girnar, a lion satellite area, was also declared as a sanctuary. Five PAs—Gir national park, Gir sanctuary, Pania sanctuary, Mitiyala sanctuary and Girnar sanctuary—covering 1,621 sq. km, are presently managed as the Asiatic lion’s habitat.

“In two decades (1995-2015), more than 40% of the total number of lions was spotted outside the Gir landscape. The prey population, predation behaviour of the lion and acceptance of the lion as an honourable animal by the villagers indicate that the present trend may continue in the near future as well,"" the study added.

However, it expressed concern at the massive pace of infrastructure development.

“The development of industries and ports, mining activities, rails and high-speed roads in the coastal area have already impacted the lions. The increased frequency and speed of goods trains in Pipavav-Rajula line has posed a new threat as 10 lions were killed during 2013-15,"" it noted.

“The change in land-use pattern and disappearance of wastelands and community lands are other issues of concern,"" the analysis added.

“The increasing population of lions will not sustain in Gujarat in coming years. Not just lion-human conflicts but other problems too, like unnatural deaths and genetic disorders, will surface. Keeping lions only in Gujarat is also against international norms,"" said Ajay Dubey, secretary of non-governmental organization Prayatna, which has long campaigned for moving lions out of Gujarat.

The Supreme Court, in an April 2013 order, directed the Union environment ministry to shift some of Gujarat’s lions to the Kuno wildlife sanctuary in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. But the order has not been implemented so far.

social proximity associated with group living favors parasite transmission. Despite this cost, sociality is widespread in a large range of taxonomic groups. In this context, hosts would be expected to have evolved behavioral mechanisms to reduce the risk of parasite infection. Few empirical studies have focused on the influence of pathogen-mediated selection on the evolution of antiparasitic behavior in wild vertebrates. We report an adaptive functional relationship between parasitism and social behavior in mandrills, associated with evidence that they are able to gauge parasite status of their group members. Using long-term observations, controlled experiments, and chemical analyses, we show that (i) wild mandrills avoid grooming conspecifics infected with orofecally transmitted parasites; (ii) mandrills receive significantly more grooming after treatment that targets these parasites; (iii) parasitism influences the host’s fecal odors; and (iv) mandrills selectively avoid fecal material from parasitized conspecifics. These behavioral adaptations reveal that selecting safe social partners may help primates to cope with parasite-mediated costs of sociality and that “behavioral immunity” plays a crucial role in the coevolutionary dynamics between hosts and their parasites.

INTRODUCTION Parasites act as selective agents by imposing substantial costs on their hosts, affecting species both at individual and population levels (1, 2). They potentially drive movement patterns (3), affect various life history traits, and may markedly affect the evolution of social life (4, 5). Social species face high risk of infection because group living generates fertile ground for parasite transmission (6, 7). Therefore, parasite-mediated selection has driven the emergence of complex host defense mechanisms to limit the spread of parasites (8–10). In addition to their physiological immune system, animals have developed a “behavioral immune system,” which comprises a sophisticated set of parasite avoidance strategies, such as sanitary behaviors (11–13), that represent a first line of defense in decreasing parasite encounter rates. Parasites may also influence host social relationships because conspecifics themselves represent a high risk of contagion. However, in animal societies, social avoidance of parasitism has been studied almost exclusively in the contexts of sexual selection (14) and kin selection in eusocial species, with reports of self-exclusion of sick animals from the social group (15). We propose that avoidance of parasitized individuals may occur in a much broader social context. Despite the growing acceptance of the idea that parasites may interfere with host behavioral interactions (8, 16), data on parasitism as an evolutionary driver of host social relationships in wild vertebrate populations are lacking. Here, we study the influence of intestinal protozoa, transmitted from host to host by body contact via the orofecal route, on the behavioral strategies of wild mandrills living in southern Gabon. Mandrills are group-living Old World monkeys living in dense equatorial rainforests and facing intensive parasite pressures in their natural habitat (17). As in other primates, allogrooming is a highly valuable social tool, buffering social competition induced by group living and enhancing the well-being and fitness of both groomer and groomee (18). Moreover, allogrooming is possibly an important hygienic behavior (19). However, intimate physical interactions between grooming partners, including the ingestion of particles, such as skin fragments and ectoparasites, should also favor orofecal transmission of protozoa. Here, we examined in a large free-ranging population of mandrills whether (i) parasitized individuals harbor protozoans on their fur, (ii) mandrills show patterns of allogrooming that could indicate that they are avoiding conspecifics with parasitic infections, and (iii) individuals discriminate conspecifics infected with protozoans by the smell of their feces. We carried out coprological analyses of skin smears (one from the perianal area and one from other parts of the body) from 36 individuals of known parasite status. The proportion of smears with infectious protozoan stages was always higher in parasitized than in nonparasitized animals (P ≤ 0.05 for three of the five protozoa taxa infecting these particular samples), and the proportion of positive smears was also always higher when collected around the perianal area than other body parts in parasitized animals (P ≤ 0.1 for three of the four protozoa taxa infecting these particular samples) (table S1). Therefore, grooming parasitized conspecifics is potentially more risky for the groomer than when grooming nonparasitized conspecifics, leading to the prediction that individuals (i) should avoid grooming parasitized, contagious individuals and (ii) should particularly avoid grooming the perianal area of these individuals.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION For 2.5 years (October 2012 to April 2015), we performed behavioral observations using focal sampling on 25 mandrills from the studied population (13 females aged 4 to 22 years and 12 males aged 1.5 to 15 years) with known protozoan status (Supplementary Materials). We calculated monthly individual indices of the time spent receiving or giving grooming. We analyzed these indices in relation to the monthly individual protozoan richness (mean number of taxa per individual per month) and the specific protozoan status for each studied taxon (mean number of fecal samples with a particular protozoan taxon per individual per month) (17). We performed general linear mixed models (LMM) controlling for other confounding predictors (individual’s sex, age, and social rank as fixed effects and individual identity as a random effect) and used a multimodel approach to show that the best models for grooming received, but not for grooming given, include protozoan richness [n = 105 individual.month (one individual sampled in a particular month)] (Table 1A). We considered that a predictor was plausible when its importance score, that is, the sum of the Akaike weights (20) of models incorporating this predictor, was higher than the expected value (“expected ratio”) under the assumption that all tested models have equal Akaike weights. In agreement with our first prediction, individuals parasitized by a large number of protozoan taxa received less grooming from their conspecifics than individuals bearing low protozoan richness (Table 1A). When we performed models with a specific parasite status for the seven studied protozoan taxa, instead of richness, we found that only Balantidium coli decreased the grooming received in parasitized individuals (importance, 0.53; expected ratio, 0.50; estimate, −0.33) (table S2). However, the best model that includes protozoan richness had a lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) than the best model that includes B. coli (190.51 versus 196.79, respectively). Because no such relationships were observed between the grooming given and parasitism (Table 1B), the direction of allogrooming appears to be crucial regarding protozoan transmission: The observed effect is not simply due to spatial exclusion or self-isolation of parasitized individuals but is due to selective grooming from social partners. In line with this result, we further found that fine-grained spatial associations among a subset of 13 individuals, equipped with proximity data loggers for a year, were independent of their protozoan status (multimodel LMM approach). Several properties of the generated spatial networks (daily degrees and numbers of contact) were independent of an individual’s protozoan richness (importance < expected ratio) (table S3). Table 1 Effects of predictors on the index of (A) grooming received and (B) grooming given and on (C) the proportion of grooming events, including the perianal area. For each predictor, we calculated the sum of Akaike weights of the models, including the predictor (importance) and compared it to the expected value under the assumption that all tested models have equal Akaike weights (expected ratio) to show the plausibility of each predictor. Plausible predictors (in bold) are those with an importance greater than the expected ratio. The estimate coefficient associated to each predictor variable and its SEM are reported. Dominance in interaction with sex is not shown in the tables because this interaction was never included in the set of best models. View this table: Mandrills allocate, on average, 9.2% of their grooming time to the perianal area of their conspecifics. We therefore analyzed whether the protozoan status of the groomee predicted the probability that a received grooming event included the perianal area. Using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a binomial distribution, we found that individuals parasitized by a large number of protozoan taxa received fewer grooming events involving the perianal area than individuals harboring few protozoan taxa (n = 31 individual.month, multimodel GLMM approach) (Table 1C), in accordance with our second prediction. To further test our finding that individuals parasitized by a large number of protozoan taxa received less grooming, we deparasitized 16 individuals against protozoa either during regular observations (n = 3 individuals) or during captures (n = 13 individuals). We showed that the frequency of grooming received, but not of grooming given, significantly increased after treatment (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, P < 0.01 and P = 0.14 resp.) (Fig. 1), whereas grooming received and given did not significantly increase for the nine control individuals that were captured but not deparasitized (Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, P > 0.1 in both instances) (fig. S1). Fig. 1 Effect of antiparasitic treatment on the frequency of grooming received. Frequencies of grooming received were retrieved from a 6-week period extending from 3 weeks before treatment to 3 weeks after treatment. Each line represents one of the 16 deparasitized cases. Dotted gray lines with empty symbols represent individuals that received less grooming after than before treatment (n = 4). Solid blue lines with filled symbols represent individuals that received more grooming after than before treatment (n = 12). Of these 12 cases, the thick blue lines represent three individuals that received 10 times more grooming than represented in the figure (frequencies were divided by 10 to fit to the figure). Using both correlative and experimental approaches, we document parasite-induced behavioral plasticity, suggesting that social avoidance behavior evolved in this Old World primate as a host strategy to limit parasite infection. To the best of our knowledge, there are only two other reported cases of social avoidance strategies: Gregarious lobsters do not share dens with individuals infected by a lethal virus (21), and parasite-free bullfrog tadpoles do not swim with infected conspecifics (22). These strategies require efficient recognition mechanisms to discriminate parasitized conspecifics. Individual odors are likely cues of parasitism because infectious diseases often trigger changes in body odors (23). Moreover, mandrills often use olfaction to elaborate olfactory-guided behavioral responses (24), and they also often closely investigate conspecifics’ perianal area. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the observed relationship between grooming behavior and protozoan status in mandrills is mediated by an olfactory mechanism. We analyzed the chemical composition of 59 fecal samples collected from 30 individuals from the study population exhibiting different protozoan richness, using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses. Protozoan richness influenced the chemical composition of fecal odors (permutational multivariate analysis: F = 0.10, R2 = 0.11, P < 0.01) (tables S4 and S5): the least chemically similar pairs of samples were those that showed the largest differences in protozoan richness. As for behavior, this relationship was particularly due to the presence of B. coli (F = 13.3, R2 = 0.07, P < 0.01) in addition to that of Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (F = 9.2, R2 = 0.05, P = 0.01) (Supplementary Materials) and Entamoeba coli (F = 21.4, R2 = 0.10, P < 0.001) (table S4). Each of these parasites modified the chemical composition of fecal material: Among all possible pairs of fecal samples, the ones sharing a given parasite taxon are the most chemically similar pairs (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Chemical similarity (mean ± SEM) between pairs of fecal samples with same or different protozoan statuses, for three protozoan taxa. Gray bars represent the average chemical similarity across pairs of nonparasitized fecal samples (E. coli, n = 435; E. histolytica/dispar, n = 325; and B. coli, n = 105), blue bars represent pairs of two parasitized fecal samples (E. coli, n = 528; E. histolytica/dispar, n = 406; and B. coli, n = 946), and hatched bars represent pairs of fecal sample with different protozoan statuses (E. coli, n = 858; E. histolytica/dispar, n = 870; and B. coli, n = 660). Significant differences are indicated for two-by-two comparisons (Kruskal-Wallis test, ***P < 0.001 for all instances). Finally, we conducted 30 olfactory tests on 16 semi–free-ranging mandrills to experimentally confirm that olfactory cues contained in mandrills’ fecal material provide information about host protozoan richness. During these tests, we presented pairs of fecal samples (rubbed on bamboo shoots) to temporarily isolated mandrills. Each pair of fecal samples, obtained not more than 3.5 months apart, was collected during the course of the study from the same individual from the free-ranging population. One sample contained at least two more protozoan taxa than the other sample. Individual subjects spent less time in proximity (<1 m) to the highly parasitized fecal sample than to the other, less parasitized fecal sample (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P = 0.014; n = 30) (Fig. 3). This last result shows that olfaction is one possible proximate mechanism mediating the relationship between parasitism and sociality: Mandrills chemically discriminate fecal odors on the basis of the bearer’s protozoan status. Fig. 3 Differences in time spent in proximity (<1 m) to non- or sparsely-parasitized samples versus highly-parasitized samples. n = 30 behavioral tests. Each bar represents the time difference (in minutes) recorded during one test. Blue bars, subjects spent more time in proximity to the highly-parasitized fecal sample than to the non- or sparsely-parasitized fecal sample (n = 9); gray bars, subjects spent more time in proximity to the non- or sparsely-parasitized fecal sample than to the highly-parasitized fecal sample (n = 19). For two tests, subjects spent equal time near the two fecal samples. This study reports social avoidance strategies combined with an accurate detection mechanism of contagious risk in a long-lived vertebrate. In the coevolutionary process linking parasites to their hosts, the latter continually evolve new strategies to counteract the costs of parasitism, whereas parasites adapt to bypass new host defense mechanisms (25). Although the evolution of the physiological immune system has been at the core of studies on host defense, theoretical studies have suggested that “behavioral immunity” could play a crucial role in host-parasite coevolutionary dynamics, driving the evolutionary trajectory of both species and influencing epidemiological parameters (26). The ability of mandrills to recognize and choose safe social partners, which we report here, helps explain how social species offset the costs of parasitism linked to frequent social interactions. However, social avoidance strategies should incur costs for the hosts because grooming is beneficial for both social partners involved (18). Therefore, hosts face a trade-off between these costs and the gain in fitness due to the avoidance of infection. These strategies are therefore expected to evolve only if the costs of being parasitized are high, that is, for virulent parasites. Interestingly, B. coli, which affects both grooming rates and fecal odorants in the studied mandrills, causes dysentery syndromes that are sometimes lethal in humans and other primates (27, 28). In addition, E. histolytica, which is also detected in the population (Supplementary Materials), may cause fatal amoebiasis in humans and several other primates (29). Even low infection levels of gastrointestinal parasites may alter components of hosts’ fitness (30, 31) or lower performance and growth (32–34). Consequently, even if the protozoa studied here do not present conspicuous acute syndromes in mandrills, they are likely to act as selective agents driving the evolution of social avoidance strategies in hosts. Similarly, in human societies, the reported aversion to diseased individuals has been proposed to shape many aspects of our biology, some characteristics of human personality traits such as xenophobia and ethnocentrism, as well as cultural differences (35). Therefore, the constant coevolution between parasites and their hosts has not only driven the evolution of defense mechanisms but has also profoundly shaped the evolution of social systems.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Study populations We studied two populations of mandrills living in southern Gabon. The free-ranging population comprises ~120 to 130 habituated individuals living in a private park (Lékédi Park). This population was founded in 2002 when 36 mandrills were released from a captive population (36). Starting in 2003, wild males joined the group and reproduced with females born in captivity. In 2006, 29 other captive individuals were released into the initial group. During the first months after release, they were provisioned three to four times a week with bananas and monkey chow in quantities that never fulfilled their caloric need. The pace of this supplementation decreased rapidly (2008 to 2012) and completely ceased in April 2012. Tourists have regularly visited the group since 2004 (one visit a week on average), and the group consequently remained habituated to human presence. The frequency of tourist visitation decreased rapidly from 2012 to about one visit per month and ceased in June 2014. A long-term field study of this population—the “Mandrillus Project” [www.projetmandrillus.com (37)]—was set up in January 2012. At that time, more than 80% of the population was wild-born. Owing to daily monitoring, more than 100 individuals were individually known, and several field assistants collected day-long behavioral, demographic, and group-living data as well as fecal material from known animals. With the exception of the olfactory behavioral tests (see below), all analyses were performed on this population. The second study population comprised ~200 individuals housed in two forested enclosures (6 and 3.5 ha; hereafter named “semi–free-ranging population”) at the Centre International de Recherches Médicales de Franceville (CIRMF). These animals forage freely, but animal keepers supplemented their diet with fruits, vegetables, and monkey chow on a daily basis. The food is placed in small closed areas that allow isolating animals for particular protocols such as behavioral tests. Tests based on olfactory cues were performed on individuals from this population. Do parasitized individuals harbor protozoan cysts on external body parts? Experimental protocol. Taking advantage of a scheduled trapping session, in July 2014, we estimated the protozoan richness (total number of protozoan taxa) (17) of 36 anesthetized individuals by taking skin smears from three different parts of their body. We also collected their feces. The anesthetics used were IMALGENE 1000 (7 mg/kg for adults and 5 mg/kg for juveniles) and xylazine (3 mg/kg for adults and 5 mg/kg for juveniles). The skin smears for each individual were obtained by rubbing a gauze on the perianal area and another one on other parts of the body (chest, arm, leg, and back). We carried out qualitative parasitological analyses on the three samples (two smears and fecal material) of each of the 36 mandrills. Coprological analyses were performed using sedimentation, following standard procedures (17). We used a similar method to analyze the skin smears by just replacing the fecal material with the gauze. We recorded protozoan cysts according to their morphological characteristics (17). Of the seven protozoan taxa known to infect individuals from the studied free-ranging population (17), six were found in the fecal material of the 36 studied individuals. Of these six protozoan taxa, Coccidia sp. parasitized only five individuals and was therefore not included in the statistical analyses discussed below. Statistical analyses. For each of the five studied protozoan taxa, we first performed Fisher’s test to compare the proportions of positive skin smears in parasitized versus nonparasitized individuals. Even nonparasitized animals may still harbor protozoan cysts on their fur because of, for example, contact with soiled environments and/or a nondetectable low level of parasitism. For the parasitized individuals, we performed additional Fisher’s tests to compare the proportions of positive skin smears when collected from the perianal area versus from other body parts. We adjusted P values for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni corrections. All statistical analyses, here and below, were performed using R version 3.0.3. How does protozoan status influence behavioral patterns of allogrooming and spatial associations? Behavioral observations. From October 2012 to April 2015, trained observers performed behavioral observations on known animals from the free-ranging population, using a 5-min focal sampling (38). The observers had no knowledge of the degree of protozoan infection of any of the mandrills. In the following analyses, we kept only individuals for whom at least 30 min of focal time was available in a given month (mean ± SEM, 175 ± 17 min of focal time including 3.4 ± 0.5 min of grooming received and 5.5 ± 1.8 min of grooming given per individual per month). We calculated a monthly frequency of grooming received and given by dividing the time spent being groomed by, or grooming, any conspecific by the total focal time performed on this animal this month. To control for variations under ecological conditions and differences in sampling effort across months, we calculated monthly indices of grooming received and given by dividing the previous frequencies by the frequencies of grooming received and given (respectively) recorded in the whole population [following the study of Silk et al. (18)]. High monthly indices of grooming received or given (>1) represented individuals that received, or gave, more grooming than the average individual found in the population during that month. Starting from July 2014, we used ad libitum data in addition to the focal data to further examine whether each allogrooming event (considered here as a discrete variable) included or not the perianal area (yes or no). Protozoan status. We have monitored the presence of parasites in the feces of known individuals since 2012 (17). We assessed monthly individual protozoan richness by recording the average number of protozoan taxa in all fecal samples obtained for each individual each month. We restricted our analyses to those months for which at least three fecal samples were available per studied animal (mean ± SEM, 4.5 ± 0.17 fecal samples per individual per month). We further assessed monthly individual specific protozoan status corresponding to the average number of positive samples—for each of the seven protozoan taxa known to occur in the mandrill population—in all samples collected from one individual during that month. In preliminary analyses, we checked that the origin of the studied animals (captive-born versus wild-born) did not influence protozoan richness and specific status (t tests, P > 0.1 in all comparisons). Spatial association. In July 2014, we equipped a subset of the population with proximity data loggers (ELA Innovation). These small radio transceiver units record spatial proximity among equipped individuals, that is, from a few centimeters (<10 cm) to 2 to 3 m, through the periodical exchange of radio packets. The proximity logger system consists of an ultrahigh frequency transceiver that broadcasts a unique ID code, while simultaneously “listening” to others. Each unit also contains a very high frequency transmitter, which pulses at a periodic rate like a beacon. At intervals of 7 min (from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.) or 1 hour (at night) and during a 20-s period, the receiving unit queries an onboard real-time clock and begins counting when one or more units are within the range and their detected ID code(s). The ID code, date, and time of the encounter are stored in a nonvolatile memory in the hardware of the collar devices and are downloaded daily by field observers using a portable reading device. We estimated two indices of spatial associations (that is, degrees and contact). “Degrees” measure the number of individuals that have been in contact with the focal individual on a given day, whereas “contact” measures all contacts with the focal individual (regardless of the identities of the contacting animals) on a given day. Statistical analyses. To study the relationship between allogrooming behavior and protozoan status, we performed LMM (nlme package, R). We investigated the effect of monthly protozoan richness as well as monthly specific protozoan status on indices of grooming received and given. These models were run using individuals that were observed (i) for at least 30 min and (ii) from whom at least three fecal samples were collected in that month (25 individuals: 13 females and 12 males aged 1.5 to 22 years, representing n = 105 individual.month). We log-transformed indices of grooming to meet normality assumptions. We used a multimodel approach to test for all possible combinations of predictors that best explained the variables of interest [that is, models associated with the highest Akaike weights based on corrected AIC (AICc)] (20). We then used model averaging with the R package MuMIn to calculate the average values of coefficients of the predictors included in the subset of models with a ΔAICc inferior to 10. We considered the following as predictors: the individual’s age (continuous predictor, in years), sex (categorical predictor, two modalities), and dominance rank (categorical predictor, three modalities) of the studied animals as well as their monthly protozoan richness or their specific protozoan status. Dates of birth of released individuals born in captivity were exactly known owing to the daily monitoring at CIRMF. The exact age of most individuals from the free-ranging population was known for those born after the beginning of the Mandrillus Project. The age of older animals born in the wild was estimated using general body condition and, for some individuals, patterns of tooth eruption and wear. Female and male monthly dominance ranks were evaluated using the outcomes of approach-avoidance interactions. We attributed their mother’s rank to the four studied males below 5 years of age. For both sexes, we considered three classes of dominance rank (low, middle, and high). “Dominance” was only included in the model in interaction with “sex” because dominance is set differently according to sex (17). We further included a random effect linked to the individual’s identity and added a structured temporal autocorrelation of the form ARMA (autoregressive moving average), to correct for potential biases due to autotemporal correlations within the data set. Second, to study the relationship between spatial association (that is, degrees and contact) and protozoan status, we used a similar multimodel LMM approach. We log-transformed the response variable contact to meet normality assumptions. We considered the sex, age, dominance rank (in interaction with sex), and monthly protozoan richness as fixed predictors and the individual’s identity as a random effect. We associated to daily degrees or contact the corresponding monthly protozoan richness for individuals equipped with proximity data loggers from whom at least three fecal samples were collected in that month (13 individuals: 11 females and 2 males aged 6 to 16 years, representing n = 40 individual.month and n = 1026 individual.day). As in the analyses described in the previous paragraph, we added a structured autocorrelation of the form ARMA. Finally, to study the relationship between monthly protozoan status of the groomee and the probability of receiving grooming events that included the perianal area, we performed GLMM, using a multimodel approach. We used a binomial distribution with a logit-link function, by treating grooming events as “yes” (those including the perianal area) and “no” (those that did not include the perianal area). We used the grooming data recorded from behavioral focal samplings and ad libitum behavioral observations. We further considered age, sex, and dominance rank in interaction with sex as fixed predictors and the individual’s identity as a random effect. As in the two previous analyses, we included only individuals from whom at least three fecal samples were collected in a given month (14 individuals: eight females and six males aged 4 to 22 years, representing n = 31 individual.month). How does experimental antiparasitic treatment influence allogrooming behavior? Antiparasitic treatment. From January 2014 to August 2015, we deparasitized 15 adult individuals on 16 occasions (one individual was deparasitized twice) using metronidazole administered either orally (n = 3) or by intravenal perfusion (n = 13). During regular behavioral monitoring, individuals were deparasitized by oral ingestion of small pieces of bananas containing 400 mg of metronidazole for five consecutive days or 5 days within a 1-week window. During trapping sessions (July to November 2014 and May 2015), individuals received slow (30 to 40 min) perfusion of metronidazole (5 mg/ml) (adult males, 200 ml; adult females, 100 ml). We were unable to systematically collect fecal samples after treatment. However, the medical drug we used is highly recommended to eradicate protozoa in veterinary and human medicines. We therefore assumed that the intensity of protozoan infection decreased in treated animals compared to untreated individuals. As controls, we used nine individuals that were captured but not deparasitized. For treated and control individuals, we calculated frequencies of allogrooming received and given by dividing the time spent by the animals receiving or giving grooming behavior by the total time the individual was observed during the two periods: 3 weeks before treatment and 3 weeks after treatment (for the 3 weeks before treatment: mean ± SEM, 204 ± 39 min of focal time per individual including 3.5 ± 0.8 min of grooming received and 8.7 ± 3.8 min of grooming given; for the 3 weeks following treatment: mean ± SEM, 225 ± 41 min of focal time per individual including 10.1 ± 1.9 min of grooming received and 11.8 ± 4.8 min of grooming given). These 3-week windows were long enough to allow the acquisition of good estimates of grooming indices. A longer period of observation would have greatly increased the probability of reinfection in treated individuals. Statistical analyses. We performed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the frequencies of grooming received and given 3 weeks before and 3 weeks after treatment or after anesthesia without treatment for control individuals. We performed two additional Wilcoxon signed-rank tests by alternatively considering only one deparasitizing event for the individual that was treated twice. This modification did not change the results. Exploration of an olfactory-guided mechanism to parasite avoidance Chemical analyses. Odor sampling, extraction and GC-MS analyses. We collected odors from 59 fecal samples obtained from 30 individuals from the free-ranging population (20 females aged 4 to 19 years and 10 males aged 4 to 14 years) with different protozoan statuses. A few hours after collection, we stored a small pellet of fecal material, previously mixed for homogenization, in a solvent-washed chromatography vial for 1 to 3 months at −20°C before shipping from Gabon to France. In France, samples were stored at −80°C until analyses were conducted. We used the solid-phase microextraction method to extract volatile compounds emitted by fecal material. After thawing the samples for 20 min, we introduced an adsorbent-coated fiber into the collection vial. Chemical extraction was run for 20 min. We collected and extracted “blanks” using similar protocols. Blanks included a random collection of volatiles present in the area where fecal samples were collected and in the laboratory where analyses were performed. We analyzed the 59 extracts on a GC-MS (Shimadzu GCMS-QP2010 Plus), equipped with a generalist ZB-5MSi (Phenomenex) capillary column (L = 30.0 m; thickness, 0.25 μm; Ø = 0.25 mm). Samples were injected in splitless mode. We set the injector temperature at 200°C and the ion source at 250°C and used helium as the carrier gas (constant linear velocity, 35 cm/s). Masses were scanned from 50 to 525 uma (unified mass in electron ionization mode in 1 s). We used the following method to discriminate chemical compounds: total run time lasted 43 min by ramping the temperature from 40° to 200°C at a rate of 5°C/min, then from 200° to 240°C at a rate of 16°C/min (held at 240°C for 4 min). We manually detected volatile compounds by integrating peaks that comprised at least 0.05% of the overall area of the chromatogram and that were not present in blank chromatograms. Because of the complex chemical composition of fecal odors, we used a semiautomatic method to group volatile compounds with similar mass spectra into clusters, without prior alignment of retention time, based on the recognition of similar mass spectra rather than on retention times or indices (39). We manually checked retention times to control the quality of the clusters. We subsequently identified the corresponding molecule for each cluster by consulting the National Institute of Standards and Technology (v.05) and Wiley (9th edition) libraries, comparing the mass spectra of representative peaks of each cluster with the reference database. Finally, we created a matrix of presence/absence (0/1) for each of the major compounds identified present in at least 20% of the chromatograms analyzed (n = 75 molecules) (table S5) to simplify a highly complex database composed of more than 150 molecules and to limit detection or identification errors. We generated a chemical distance matrix for all possible pairs of fecal samples. We used a probabilistic index (Raup-Crick) for presence/absence data that considers samples sharing rare volatile compounds as more similar than samples sharing common volatile compounds. Statistical analyses. We first studied whether differences in protozoan richness between all possible pairs of fecal samples influenced their chemical similarities, using permutation analyses (5000) with pseudo–F ratios (vegan package, adonis procedure). We controlled for the following predictors: the time lag between fecal sample collection and GC-MS analyses (quantitative predictor), the season (categorical predictor, four modalities: long-humid, short-humid, long-dry, and short-dry seasons) (17), and the sex of individuals sampled (categorical predictor, two modalities). We added an individual stratum to this model to control for multiple sampling on the same animals. In additional models, we tested for any relationship between chemical similarity and the presence (or not) of each protozoan taxon, except Pseudolimax butschlii, which was not found in the samples analyzed, controlling for the same predictors as above and adjusting P values for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni corrections. For the three protozoan taxa found to modify the chemical composition of fecal samples, we performed Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare the chemical similarity between pairs of fecal samples with identical or different protozoan statuses (Fig. 2), adjusting P values for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni corrections. Olfactory tests. Fecal sample collection. Fecal samples were collected from 11 individuals (seven females and four males aged 4 to 14 years) from the free-ranging population that served as odor donors to constitute a total of 15 pairs of fecal samples. Each pair of fecal samples used in each behavioral test was collected from the same individual not more than 3.5 months apart. We selected pairs of fecal samples that differed the most in their protozoan richness: one fecal sample (“the highly-parasitized” one) was parasitized by at least three different protozoan taxa, whereas the other (“the non- or sparsely-parasitized” one) was parasitized by zero to two protozoan taxa. There was a difference in richness of at least two protozoan taxa between paired samples. We avoided potential biases due to storage time by randomizing the age of the fecal sample and the associated protozoan status (the oldest sample of each pair was the most parasitized in 7 of 15 pairs and the least parasitized in 8 of 15 pairs). Finally, to avoid an obvious potential source of biases, we never used fecal samples collected from sexually receptive females. Experimental design. In September 2014, we performed 30 behavioral tests on 16 semi–free-ranging mandrills (“subjects”) aged 4 to 26 years in their living enclosure [one to three session(s) of 10 min per individual] and temporarily isolated from their companions. Before each session, subjects entered into a first closed area (C1) that communicates with a similar area (C2) in which behavioral tests were performed. In C2, we attached three bamboo shoots (30 cm long) in a line along the fence, each 2 m away from the preceding one and facing the observers. First, during preliminary experiments, we rubbed an herbaceous plant on the three bamboo shoots to verify that individuals were not more attracted toward the bamboo located on the middle or on the edges (n = 6 tests performed). During the actual experimental stage, we rubbed a pellet of fecal samples (one sample per bamboo shoot) thawed 20 min before use at the middle of the two external bamboos (“scented bamboos”). We alternated the position of the highly-parasitized and non- or sparsely-parasitized fecal samples between each test. As a control, we rubbed an herbaceous plant on the central, control bamboo shoot. Subjects were in visual contact with the observer during deposition of fecal material on the bamboo shoots. Each session started when the subject entered into C2. An observer, ignorant of the protozoan richness of the fecal samples, faced the three bamboos and recorded the number of olfactory investigations performed (sniffing, touching, or licking the bamboo) as well as the time spent in proximity (<1 m) to each bamboo. At the end of the test, the individual was released into C1. After each test, the enclosure was cleaned, and another pair of fecal samples was rubbed onto new bamboo shoots. Fecal samples were stored in an icebox between tests. To avoid multiple freeze-thawing, we only used each pair of fecal samples one to three times in the same half-day, depending on the number of tested individuals. Statistical analyses. In a first preliminary analysis, we confirmed that focal individuals were not more attracted toward one localization using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the number of olfactory investigations performed toward and the time spent in proximity to each of the three bamboo shoots (P > 0.1 for all two-by-two comparisons). In a second preliminary analysis, we verified that mandrills behaved differently toward the two outer, scented bamboo shoots compared to the central, control one. We used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the number of olfactory investigations performed toward and the time spent in proximity to the control bamboo to the average number of olfactory investigations toward and the average time spent in proximity to the two scented bamboos. We found that subjects, on average, investigated more and spent more time near the scented bamboos than the control bamboo (P < 0.01 for both variables). By investigating a conspecific’s fecal material, mandrills may obtain crucial information on the bearer’s social, sexual, and, whenever possible, parasite status, which may explain why fecal samples induced more interest from subjects than the control, unscented bamboo. Thereafter, we performed Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to compare the number of olfactory investigations performed toward and the time spent in proximity to each of the two scented bamboos.

When a visitor to Gir Forest National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat, India caught sight of a magnificent Asiatic lion prowling a road, he just had to get some close-up video.

The viewer, tucked away in his car, but foolishly with the window wide open, trails closely behind the lion, as the creature continues his stealth, deliberate pace.

The Asiatic lion in Gir National Park in India is loping along the side of the road minding his own business

A visitor decides to follow the beast in his car, filming with his videocamera

Soon, the King of the Jungle grows tired of being followed, and turns his penetrating, golden eyes directly on the interloper. A few moments pass as the lion sizes up the human stalker, and then the lion gives one very loud, spine-tingling growl.

The visitor quickly rolls up his window and then exhales in what sounds like a moment of pure terror.

The lion majestically continues on his way and the visitor wisely doesn't follow.

Fed up, the King of the Jungle turns and gives the visitor a long, withering stare

Titled 'Do not tease the lion,' the video was uploaded to YouTube in 2016 by RC's Videos and has over 400,000 views. Most commenters were firmly Team Lion.

'Leave the lion alone!' said one commenter.

The Giant Panda is China’s national treasure, and a powerful symbol for species conservation. The Red Panda, also called the “lesser panda,” doesn’t get nearly as much attention.

But it’s managed and cared for in much the same way.

CGTN’s Hendrik Sybrandy reports.



Zoo in Colorado works to save red pandas from extinction Denver Zoo is part of conservation efforts to protect and expand red panda population

At the Denver Zoo recently, all eyes were on this animal enclosure. It was time to said goodbye to Lali and Masu, two female Red Panda cubs, who were about to be shipped to two other zoos in the U.S.

For years, giant pandas have dominated the panda market. Their cute looks and their story of near-extinction grabbed the public’s attention.

Zoo officials said red pandas, which also come from western China and pre-date giant pandas, are every bit as endangered: only about 1200 in captivity worldwide. And they have lots of fans, too.

Lali and Masu’s departure was mandated by the Species Survival Plan, a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. Its goal is to maintain genetically diverse populations of threatened animals like the red panda.

Suzanne Braden is head of Pandas International, a non-profit organization based in Colorado whose mission is to help save the giant pandas. Those animals are bred in much the same way.

“Everybody knows that if you don’t have a large enough gene pool, then if you’re inbreeding, the species is going to get weaker, they’re going to be more susceptible to disease and health issues,” Branden said.

Giant pandas are known as an umbrella species. Efforts to protect them and their Chinese habitat also help red pandas in the wild. Red pandas also feast on bamboo. These animals, which resemble foxes or raccoons, are known for their shyness.

Their parents, Faith and Hamlet, will stay behind while Lali and Masu go their separate ways for the benefit of their species and whole new groups of devoted followers.

The red panda is a red cat bear, which is called Habre in Nepali and Punde Kundo in eastern Nepal. It is a Himalayan member of Carnivora, whose scientific name is Ailurus fulgens and is also called the lesser panda. An adult has about 93 cm to 100 cm in length and 4 kg to 6 kg weight on average. It loves to feed on leaves and shoots of highly fibrous bamboo (nigalo or malingo) though it ingests some other kinds of plants, such as fruits or berries, as their seasonal supplement.

A broad-leaved mixed temperate forest with bamboo is an essential habitat feature for it. It lives in a range of altitudes from 2,500–4,000 m, however; it has been reported to have come down to 1,500 m to 5,000 m. It generally avoids south-facing slopes preferring cooler climate. Habitat loss is affecting over 2,000 mammal species. Habitat fragmentation, habitat destruction and habitat loss due to deforestation, haphazard collection of forest products, uncontrolled livestock grazing, unmanaged road construction, inefficiently managed tourism are serious threats for it. Domestic dogs and poaching are other threats to a red panda.

According to Red Panda Network, the global population of red pandas is estimated to be less than 10,000 in the wild. Population of red pandas is estimated at 237 to 1061 in Nepal. Its population is declining due to low fecundity, high infant mortality rate, parasitic infection, population isolation, bamboo flowering and anthropogenic threats. It is a protected species in Nepal, India, China, Bhutan and Myanmar.

Around 22,400 km2 of Nepal is a suitable habitat for red pandas, which is 56.25 percent of potential red panda habitat in the Hindukush Himalaya. About 36 districts of Nepal are potential habitats for it. Its occupancy has been confirmed in 24 districts of Nepal so far. LNP (Langtang National Park) is one of the prime habitats of red pandas. LNPBZ (Langtang National Park Buffer Zone) covers an area of 418.3 km2 adjoining Nuwakot, Rasuwa and Sindhupalchok districts of Nepal. There are altogether 21 User Groups of LNPBZ. Red panda poaching and anthropogenic pressure on it should be controlled immediately. More people oriented conservation programs would increase effectiveness. Sufficient drinking water, proper education, health facility and electricity in such buffer zone communities would avoid biotic pressure not only on red pandas but also on biodiversity conservation as a whole.

The Mahatma Phule Vastu Sangrahalay is one of the most serene and calm locations on the busy Ghole Road. It was founded in 1875 as the Poona Industrial Museum after an industrial exhibition organised by the Poona Exhibition Committee. The museum, which was renamed as the Lord Raey Industrial Museum in 1885, has some of the rarest artefacts from the country’s incredible history. Rajeev Bedekar, administrator of the museum, shares, “The stuffed animals, birds and fishes are the highlight of the museum. Their - almost real - appearance makes it a memorable visit for many.”

The 3,000 sq ft area is equipped with a library, museum, study centre and several social activities are conducted throughout the month. “People are aware of the library, but the museum is still a hidden gem. People should come down to view the handicrafts, textile objects, oil paintings, armours and stone carvings. The museum holds a rich compilation of brassware, stone carvings, and marble statues too,” added Bedekar.

One thing that one cannot miss here is the taxidermy (preserving of animal bodies), the cheetah, Indian lion, birds and fishes,which are a great view in glass shelves. ( HT PHOTO )

The museum collection is divided in halls which cater to several sections, such as industries and engineering; geology and minerals; handicrafts and cottage industries; agriculture, forestry, natural history and armoury. “The botanical garden surrounding the museum building proposes to raise over 600 plants. The library contains books on various sections and are classified according to Dewey’s decimal classification system.

The premise also conducts many social events and encourages students to participate in courses conducted by them. “We have a study centre for students appearing for competitive exams. We also hold cultural programmes that help create awareness among the citizens,” said Bedekar.

This historical birth occurred on July 27 in Chile”s Buin Zoo, 35 kilometers south of capital Santiago, reports the Radio Cooperativa.

Pantaleon, son of Hannah and Oliver, weighed 62 kg and drew its first breath amid a 30-min birth work.

Pantaleon, belonging to Ceratotherium simum species, is the first of its kind to be born in South America.

Healthy and with a weight gain of 40 kg in just 20 days thanks to its mum’s feeding, Pantaleon was named after the Catholic saint.

Experts have recalled it is a threatened and endangered species. It is believed that there are between 19,000 and 21,000 animals of this kind all over the world.

The achievement with Pantaleon is remarkable, according to scientists, because a pair of rhinos can breed one every four years and the state of pregnancy lasts 18 months. In addition, the mother must breastfeed the newborn during two years."~[]

A pair of mandrill baby monkeys recently born at the Los Angeles Zoo will make their media debut Tuesday.

A female baby was born on Aug. 3 to five-year-old mother, Juliette.

A male baby was born on Aug. 17 to four-year-old mother, Clementine.

The first-time mothers were brought to the zoo in April 2016 from Parc Zoologique de La Palmyr in France.

The babies share the same first-time father, six-year-old Jabari, as part of a species survival program.

“This is a very new breeding group of mandrills that has only been together for about a year, so we’re incredibly happy with how well things are going so far,” said L’Oreal Dunn, an animal keeper at the zoo. “This species comes from a small area in Africa that isn’t accessible to most people, so it’s very special that our guests can now observe babies here for the first time in over 40 years.”

Mandrills in the wild live in the rainforests of western Africa in Cameroon, Gabon and southwestern Congo, according to the zoo.

Their population is declining due to habitat loss and the spread of agriculture and human settlement.

The primates are often hunted as bushmeat as many Africans consider them to be a delicacy."~[]

Born in the early hours of Monday, October 9, the week-old monkey is the second born to mum Niari and third for dad Tabah.

Adelaide Zoo senior primate keeper Sophie Miller said the tiny youngster, which is the ninth of its species to be born at Adelaide Zoo, was thriving.

""It was certainly a nice surprise to arrive at work last week and be greeted by Niari and her new arrival,"" she said.

""The little one is already getting a lot of attention from the rest of the mandrill family, but Niari is being a very protective mum and has a strict hands-off policy with the rest of the family.

""Big sister Mayombe is particularly keen to get a closer look at her new sibling but the infant is clinging tightly to mum.""

The infant's gender is yet to be revealed.

Mandrills, the largest species of monkey, are classified as vulnerable to extinct in the wild following habitat loss caused by deforestation and hunting for the bushmeat trade.

The latest new arrival follows the birth of five baby meerkats in August."~[]

The endangered four-year-old tiger was recently spotted in the same region where he was exiled this time last year.

Vladik first made headlines in October 2016 when he wandered into the far eastern Russian town of Vladivostok, his namesake. The Siberian tiger population in this area has been low after habitat loss and hunting caused their population to plummet in the 1930s. It's extremely rare for residents to see a tiger in the streets, so when 300-pound Vladik sauntered into town, they panicked.

The Siberian Times reported that police patrolled the streets with machine guns and drones. Vladik was eventually captured after police received a tip about his whereabouts, tracked him down, fired a sedative shot into his neck, and transferred the comatose tiger to the Amur Tiger Center, a group that works to rescue and rehabilitate Siberian tigers. (Read more about Vladik's capture.)

For seven months, Vladik stayed at the center, where veterinarians monitored his health and tested his hunting skills. For his release, Amur, World Wildlife Fund Russia, and Russia's Natural Resources Ministry sponsored a helicopter to fly the big cat into Bikin National Park.

It was a conservation success story with a happy ending. But Vladik had other plans.

For months, the tiger has been roaming the region, preying on Himalayan black bears, crossing a highway, traversing a railroad track, and bypassing several small towns. He walked nearly 400 miles south, where he was spotted just outside of his old stomping grounds, Vladivostok. This time around, however, Vladik seems to be exercising more caution and keeping a lower profile.

The center admitted they've known for months that Vladik moved out of the park but only recently made that knowledge public, out of fear for the cat's safety. Officials know where the tiger is because they fitted him with a GPS tracking collar before he was released into the park, in part to study movements of the species.

So far, Vladik hasn't walked in front of the camera traps the center has rigged along his predicted path, so they've only been able to track his motion from afar.

""We are joking that this might be a 'victory lap,'"" said Andrey Shorshin from the Amur Tiger Center.

Large male tigers like Vladik are known to roam large distances in search of territory that may provide access to a mate and a steady food supply.

Ten percent of the world's endangered Amur tiger population resides in Bikin National Park, and officials speculated that Vladik may have left because of overcrowding. Reconciling a slowly rebounding tiger population with increasing development is a difficult problem for the Amur Tiger Center and other conservationists. Roughly 500 Siberian tigers can be found in the region, and their population is expected to grow."~[]

We may have just finally discovered where red pandas belong in the tree of life, and they are unlike anything else alive today. These small mammals are distinguishable by their rusty red–coloured fur and bushy ringed tails. They live in Southern China, Myanmar, Nepal, and India in high mountains within bamboo forests. Unfortunately, they are currently endangered.

They have been confusing biologists for almost 200 years

Other names for the red panda include cat-bear, bear-cat, lesser panda, fox bear, Himalayan racoon, and firefox (yes, the web browser is named after it). When they were first discovered by Frédéric Cuvier in 1825, he placed them in the same family as racoons because of their head shape, teeth, and ringed tails. A 1977 Nature paper also placed red pandas in the same family as racoons. Then, because of their similarity to panda bears and DNA composition, red pandas were thought to be part of the bear family. Now, they are the only members of the Ailuridae family, which is most closely related to the group containing weasels, racoons, and skunks.

Their closest relatives are long gone

Red pandas have no living relatives.Their most recent fossil ancestor, Parailurus, had a large distribution across Eurasia tens of millions of years ago. There may have been three different species of Parailurus that are all larger and had a more robust head and jaw than the red panda. The family, Ailuridae, contains seven extinct genera of animals. Fossils of jaws and other bones from extinct red panda relatives have been found in Spain, Eastern Europe, and the US. The UK is also home to a giant panda—no it’s not the cuddly black and white giant panda, but an extinct relative of the red panda. A lower jaw and fossil molar of this cougar-sized beast were found in 1888.

Almost a wah?

An English naturalist, Major General Thomas Hardwicke, presented the discovery of the red panda to the Linnean Society in London in 1821. He was likely the first Western scientist to discover the red panda, which he did so during his service in India. He gave a presentation entitled “Description of a new Genus of the Class Mammalia, from the Himalaya Chain of Hills Between Nepal and the Snowy Mountains.” He thought that it should be called a “Wah” because of the sound of its call for which the locals called it the Wha or Chitwha. Hardwicke’s paper was only published two years after Cuvier’s description in 1825, which meant that he lost the right to name the species.

Red pandas are not giant pandas

Actually, red pandas were the first animal to be called “panda”. Frédéric Cuvier, a French zoologist, first described the red panda in 1825 and called it Ailurus fulgens (fire-coloured or shining cat) after its cat-like appearance and bright fur colour. The origin of “panda” is unknown but could be from the Himalayan language or the French name for the Roman goddess of peace and travellers. The giant panda was not described until 1873 and also named panda because of its similarities to the red panda.

Both the red panda and giant panda eat mostly bamboo and live in high-altitude forests in Asia. Both pandas have a sort of thumb created from a modified wrist bone that is only used for holding the bamboo when they feed. This is an example of convergent evolution, as the animals are not closely related, though the thumbs evolved in the two pandas for different reasons. In contrast, giant pandas are not picky at all and will eat every part of bamboo, while red pandas only eat leaf tips and shoots, which are more nutritious.

Vegetarian by choice

Although red pandas are most closely related to carnivores and they have a carnivore stomach, they mostly eat bamboo and other plants. On rare occasions, they’ll hunt a small mammal or bird and eat bird eggs. This trait is also similar to most species of bears, which also eat a mostly vegetarian diet, with the exception of the polar bear.

Other unique facts

When presented with water and sweetened water, red pandas preferred the water with artificial sweeteners, making them the only known non-primate to be able to taste aspartame. In colder temperatures, red pandas become dormant, with a very low metabolism rate, which they only shake out of to get food. Additionally, they mark their territory with a clear liquid produced by glands between their footpads. The red pandas have a cone-like structure at the bottom of their tongues to test odours and bring items close to a gland in their mouths.

Even though we know how to classify red pandas, they are still unique animals that need our protection so that they don’t go the way of the rest of their taxonomic family."~['US']

action fund~"In 2017, Rainforest Trust expanded its global reach and worked in Australia for the first time. With 150,486 acres protected across Asia, the conservation organization made huge strides forward to protect critical habitat and endangered species.

A great accomplishment was the protection of the 44,726-acre Caloola property on the Cape York Peninsula of Australia. This was the largest land purchase that Rainforest Trust has supported and remarkably, this property is almost entirely undisturbed habitat. The Caloola property strategically creates a permanent connection among a vast network of protected areas that spans over 700,000 acres. The area contains 28 regional ecosystems, 20 of which have low or no representation in the Australian protected area network. Water for Cooktown is sourced from the Annan River that runs beside the Caloola property. The presence of a very significant population of the Endangered Northern Quoll has been confirmed on the protected area, as well as Bennett’s Tree Kangaroos and several Vulnerable and Near Threatened bat species.

In addition to supporting its Australian partner in the purchase of the Caloola property, the conservation groups also helped create the 173.5-acre Misty Mountain Nature Reserve. This site now functions as a wildlife corridor and safeguards the remaining missing link to complete a nearly 3 million-acre high priority rainforest mosaic in Australia’s Wet Tropics World Heritage Area. While this region has been a national priority, the high altitude rainforests on volcanic basalt have been very extensively cleared and are highly fragmented. Connecting the remaining areas was essential for the long term survival of many charismatic rainforest species within Queensland.

Rainforest Trust also worked to expand the Daintree National Park. The Daintree Rainforest is among the oldest rainforests on Earth and is the largest continuous area of tropical rainforest remaining in Australia. Because of the Daintree’s unique evolutionary history and wealth of wildlife, it has been declared a Wet Tropics World Heritage Site, with Daintree National Park lying at the center of protection efforts. However, encroaching housing development around the park’s borders threatens to fragment forests and disrupt wildlife through human traffic and the introduction of exotic plants. Purchasing and securing private properties in this area has helped reduce the risk of habitat fragmentation and consolidates protected areas within the Daintree.

In the Philippines, Rainforest Trust and a local partner established a refuge for the Critically Endangered Palawan Forest Turtle, one of the 25 most threatened turtle species in the world. 2,413 acres were designated by the municipal government of Mendoza, and Rainforest Trust is working diligently with its partner to expand this protection to total 4,552 acres. Rainforest Trust also worked with another local partner to establish the Hibusong Wildlife Sanctuary of 1,390 acres on the biodiverse island of Dinagat. The sanctuary is the first in a series of four new protected areas that will comprise more than 17,800 acres in the coming year to secure forest and coastal habitat. Dinagat Island is recognized as a Key Biodiversity Area, with numerous threatened species such as the Golden-crowned Flying Fox, Dinagat Bushy-tailed Cloud Rat and the Dinagat Moonrat. Before the sanctuary was established by Rainforest Trust and its partner, there were no protected areas on Dinagat.

In Malaysia, Rainforest Trust permanently protected a 34,414-acre former logging concession in the last great forests of Northern Borneo. This vital habitat for Critically Endangered Bornean Orangutans and Sunda Pangolins is now incorporated into the Kuamut Forest Reserve, which safeguards the last vulnerable flank of the pristine forest of the world-renowned Danum Valley Conservation Area.

Rainforest Trust also supported a land purchase to create a critical wildlife corridor in Borneo to secure a safe passage for Pygmy Elephants. This project with a local partner protects the Kinabatangan Corridor which links two wildlife reserves and provides orangutans and elephants with safe passage along the northern banks of the Kinabatangan River, one of Malaysia’s most beautiful rainforest wetlands. This land within the corridor was sought by the oil palm industry, making its protection all the more urgent. Now a lifeline for Pygmy Elephants, the new protected area is frequented by other imperiled wildlife such as Sun Bears, Clouded Leopards and Bornean Ground-cuckoos. The corridor’s benefits even extend to the local community, conserving traditional fishing grounds and providing ecotourism opportunities to support their livelihoods.



In Indonesia, Rainforest Trust and a local partner conserved vital nesting grounds for the Endangered Maleo in northern Sulawesi. As one of Asia’s most iconic birds, Maleos build mounds to incubate their eggs through volcanic and solar-heated sand in large colonial nesting grounds, a natural spectacle that leaves the eggs exceptionally vulnerable to harvesting. With a nearly 90 percent decline in population size since 1950, it is estimated that fewer than 5,000 of these birds remain in the wild. These 316 acres secured by Rainforest Trust and its local partner will contribute to the overall project which will form a 47,328-acre protected area of nesting sites, coastal habitat, forest conservation area and agroforestry buffer zone.

In the Republic of Palau, Rainforest Trust supported a crucial land purchase to save Endangered Megapodes. The reserve is the first private land converted to a protected area on the island of Peleliu, and it protects a vital foraging area for the Micronesian Scrubfowl, known locally as the Micronesian Megapode. The site also contains a famous WWII memorial, as it is notoriously the location of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Pacific war.

In Myanmar, Rainforest Trust and a local partner created the 66,965-acre Kaydoh Mae Nyaw Wildlife Sanctuary which protects subtropical broadleaf forest and provides a safe haven for wildlife such as the Asian Elephant, Tiger, Dhole, Banteng, Phayre’s Leaf-monkey and two species of Pangolin – the Sunda and Chinese – both of which are Critically Endangered. Rainforest Trust’s local partner is ensuring that the protected area is managed by the indigenous community, and conservation efforts will focus on collaborative management and capacity building in the form of patrolling and law enforcement, protected area infrastructure and awareness programs. Community development and education programs as well as agricultural assistance and alternative livelihood programs ensure ongoing community commitment to conservation.

Thank you to the generous support of our friends around the world and the SAVES Challenge, for making these projects a success.

celebrated as a national animal of Korea. It is also widely considered to be extinct on the peninsula.

Where at the beginning of the twentieth century the animal’s range encompassed the endless forests of what is now the Russian Far East, Manchuria, and Korea, now it is largely confined to a handful of reserves dotted throughout Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsk Krai, and northern China.

Only around five hundred Siberian tigers remain in the wild, stalking wild boar or roe deer through the woods, or else stalked themselves by avid wildlife documentarians eager to capture the elusive cat on film.

In Korea, absence has made the heart grow fonder. The image of these animals, at least south of the DMZ, has been thoroughly sanitized. Shorn from the memory is their regular predation on livestock and, occasionally, on people, and the tiger is now fondly appreciated as a playful, even cuddly, symbol of national pride.

It is an impression cemented by the stunning remove of the South Korean landscape from the archipelago of small towns and dense forests that preceded it. Seoul, for one, is no longer the same warren of wooden houses and royal palaces that channeled tigers through its gardens, parks, and sewers.

And yet, there remain a few isolated stretches of the Korean peninsula where one might imagine a handful of these animals continuing to eke out a sheltered, if fragile, existence. The forests of North Hamgyong province, composed of broadleaf and pine forests, support boar, roe deer and other ungulate populations – it is an ecosystem that could conceivably sustain a small number of tigers all year round.

NARROW ACCESS

It was to find a way to prove this that, in 1997, brought Anatolii Kachur to Pyongyang. As deputy director at the Pacific Geographical Institute in Vladivostok, Kachur had been involved in conservation projects in the region for almost two decades.

The organization had been exchanging data on Siberian tigers with scientists from the DPRK for a number of years, yet without sources of funding, no joint field survey had been attempted.

Only around five hundred Siberian tigers remain in the wild

A pitch to UNESCO broke this impasse. “When the funding was approved, we immediately contacted the Korean side and arranged a meeting,” Kachur says.

The talks in Pyongyang proved difficult; access to the desired survey sites by foreign conservation workers was not a realistic possibility. On the last day of negotiations, however, the mood abruptly changed.

“According to our Korean colleagues, the final decision was made by Kim Jong Il, who personally considered the goals of this project and approved its implementation.”

Before an international team would be allowed into the country, it was agreed that specialists from the North Korean Institute of Geography would conduct their own preliminary survey in the Paektu Mountain Area.

It was there, close to the quasi-sacred sites of the Korean revolution, that all sides hoped evidence of the elusive tiger might soon be discovered.

SAVAGE GOD

In the beginning, Hwanung, son of the Lord of Heaven, descended unto Mount Paektu to found a new civilization. The culture prospered, and one day a bear and a tiger prayed to Hwanung that they, too, might be transformed into people, so that they could have human children. He agreed, on the condition that the two animals shelter in a cave for one hundred days and only eat magic herbs.

After twenty days, the tiger could suffer this regime no longer and left the cave. The bear endured, however, and after her hundredth day into the cave transformed into a human woman and married Hwanung. Together they had a son, Tangun, who would establish the kingdom of Gojoseon, the first Korean state.

For centuries, the tiger was considered indivisible from Korean culture: present at its beginning, it would probably remain there until its end, prowling across its hills and forests, its folktales and proverbs.

Throughout, its conduct would remain unpredictable. The Korean word for tiger is horang-I, Ho deriving from the Chinese character referring to the physical animal, and rang meaning “young boy.” According to religious scholar Edward R. Canda, the effect is to portray the tiger in the Korean imagination as childlike in temperament, pointing towards its “ambivalent nature: dangerous, powerful, innocent, harmless.”

This dual state would have proven little comfort to any Korean unfortunate enough to face the animal alone. For much of Korea’s history, tigers were known for routinely killing and eating individuals in the countryside, especially in mountainous areas.

As early as the 14th century, the Joseon dynasty employed specialists to hunt the animals, to guard against further attacks and skin them for fur. These men – accompanied by trained dogs and armed with matchlocks, lances and short swords – were celebrated for their bravery and skill, often having only one chance to bring the animal down lest they, too, be devoured.

“According to our Korean colleagues, the final decision was made by Kim Jong Il, who personally considered the goals of this project and approved its implementation.”

Not all tigers killed in the pre-modern period were killed in self-defense. The animals were, at times, so common that hunts were deliberately organized for sport and the collection of furs. As Canda notes, tiger artifacts were prized for their ability to ‘magically enhance human power.’

Tiger skins were used as luxurious household objects, lain on floors and chairs to assert wealth or nobility. Tiger cheeks and whiskers were sewn into hats worn by the royal bodyguards of the Yi dynasty. Tiger claws were given by husbands to their wives as tokens of their courage, or worn around the neck by children as lucky charms. Tiger bones were broken up and their gelatin extracted, to be mixed with wine and drunk to increase sexual potency. Pictures of tigers were even hung on front doors, to ward off evil spirits.

This semi-permanent state of vigilance among Koreans led to dozens of proverbs using tigers as a jumping-off point for wider illustrations of common sense.

Popular sayings included “Block a hole in a window at the sight of a tiger,” a fatalistic reference to the precautions one must take against imminent danger to life (Korean windows were often made of hanji paper, and would provide little defence against a tiger determined to leap into a house); “the wolf at the front gate, the tiger at the back”, implying a choice between two undesirable outcomes; and “Speak of the tiger and then he appears,” a phrase explaining link between an obsession with danger and its inadvertent invitation. The proverb is almost identical in meaning to its counterpart in English, which substitutes the presence of the tiger for the devil himself.

MADNESS AND SHADOWS

Stepping off the train at Rajin, Dale Miquelle was hoping the devil might appear for him. An expert on Siberian tigers and a biologist with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in Primorsky Krai, he had spent the first half of the 1990s, trapping the animals in the wild and analyzing their movements.

WCS had worked closely in collaboration with its counterparts in Russian scientific organizations, including the Pacific Institute of Geography, on conservation measures for the Siberian tiger.

When Kachur and his colleagues returned from Pyongyang, it was perhaps only natural that WCS was included in the next stage of the proceedings: a meeting between all stakeholders in Rajin, to present the results of a preliminary North Korean field survey and discuss future conservation measures.

Initially, Miquelle hoped that this would involve a joint Russian-North Korean expedition: “Russian field biologists are exceptional at identifying the species, at least, [from] tracks, and for tigers, sometimes, you can identify the sex of the animal based on the size of the [footprints.]”

Unsurprisingly, given the somewhat obscure location of the meeting, Miquelle and his colleagues were watched at all times, and largely confined to their hotel. It was “unusual for me, as an American, to be in that little corner,” he recalls. “It was probably best that everyone just assumed I was Russian, along with my Russian colleagues, except for the few individuals from the Institute who knew better.”

Eventually, they met with director of the North Korean Institute of Geography Kim Jin Rak. It was an awkward encounter, not least for the director, who Miquelle assumes had not spoken to an American before.

“It was probably best that everyone just assumed I was Russian”

“And to be honest, it was the first time for me to be in North Korea talking to officials,” he admits. “But I think that there was a genuine common interest in the fate of tigers and leopards in that part of the world that allowed us to work through all the differences that exist between the countries, to find a common ground for the discussion of tigers.”

As planned, the North Koreans provided the results of their survey. They had chosen a search area of 6,000km2 of land in Ryanggang Province. Within that, the scientists had trudged along 700km of survey routes, and interviewed over a dozen local people – farmers, hunters, fishermen – about possible sightings. The team also investigated the density of ungulates in the area, to determine whether a tiger population could be supported in the heavily forested landscape.

The report they produced was detailed. In forests near Mudubon and Sandubon, locals had observed the seasonal migration of tigers over the border between the DPRK and China, as they followed roe deer across the porous frontier.

Another villager reported spotting a female tiger accompanied by two small cubs at the foot of a cliff, likely sheltering from the wind. Two or three more were reported to have had overlapping ranges near one mountain, while another local resident, a ranger who lived in Syanyan Town in Pkhekam District, reported finding a dead tiger “with a rotten belly” the previous winter.

That same year, “a tiger appeared in a lonely peasant house.” Fear, the report said, had driven the owner mad.

When he read the report, Miquelle was skeptical. Ultimately, there was little information inside that could be verified. All they had were photos. “We were not able to confirm that any of the tracks, in the pictures that they showed us, were actually [made by] tigers,” he says.

Ultimately, the proof that the Miquelle wanted would have to been provided by a joint survey. The conservationist was hopeful that both sides could come to some form of agreement. But then, after Miquelle and his colleagues left Rajin, the North Koreans broke off communication.

“I have no idea why,” says the conservationist, still perplexed at what happened. “We never got a response when we attempted contact.”

Serious efforts at a joint field survey would not resume until 2005, this time with WWF Russia. After being handed an invitation via the Russian Academy of Sciences, the organization dispatched a trio of scientists to conduct a short survey in the forests outside Rajin and in the steppe-like landscape of the Tumen river valley. Denis Smirnov, then a coordinator of WWF-Russia’s forestry programme, was part of the team sent to North Korea.

“It was quite a short visit,” says Smirnov, comprising several official meetings and three outdoor expeditions. Snow blanketed the forest floor. “The tracks of different animals were clearly visible,” Smirnov recalls, including some the team attributed to either a leopard or a tiger.

After Miquelle and his colleagues left Rajin, the North Koreans broke off communication

“With such a short visit, it [was] unfeasible to get direct evidence,” says Smirnov. Even so, his colleague Mikhail Kretchmar considered prey density good enough for tigers to survive in the forest, and found tracks that the team attributed to either a leopard or a tiger. Interviews with local residents were also encouraging.

One forester said that he had spotted a tiger in 1998 and in the previous year the carcasses of several wild boar that could only have been mauled by “a large cat.” Another man, a hunter, testified to the presence of boar carcasses that very same year, and felt the leopards and tigers did live in the local area, albeit in low numbers.

The team left the DPRK shortly thereafter. Smirnov would visit the country again over a year later, this time to sign a memorandum of understanding, before officials from the Peoples’ Committee of Rason visited Russia to learn how the country’s system of protected reserves was managed. After that, however, any hope of further collaboration ebbed away.

Smirnov believes it had something to do with the lack of available manpower WWF Russia could have devoted to a full-scale survey; the forester spent a period of time himself overseeing four provinces after one colleague resigned. Looking back, he attributes his enthusiasm for greater involvement in North Korea to youthful exuberance.

“Probably I underestimated the possible problems… which we could meet starting work in North Korea,” Smirnov says. He does not believe, for one, that the DPRK’s institutional knowledge of Siberian tigers was sufficient to allow meaningful scientific collaboration with WWF Russia.

After three years spent navigating a maze of government bureaucracy to combat illegal logging in Laos, he also appreciates how difficult it may have been to guarantee prolonged access to the desired survey sites closer to the Sino-Russian border.

“The results of most conservation projects in Laos are very modest,” he says. “I could imagine how long it would take in North Korea to reach some solid results.”

LONELY HARBINGER

The decline of Siberian tigers on the Korean peninsula is popularly assumed to have taken place in the first half of the 20th century, roughly coincident with the Japanese occupation.

In truth, it is more likely that their numbers began to fall by the 18th century, thanks to organized extermination campaigns ordered by the Korean state. Records of the time regularly boasted of dozens, sometimes up to a hundred tigers killed in a single hunt. Given the detrimental impact the hunting and human disturbance has on the reproduction rate of big cats, it was small wonder that they quickly became endangered.

Hunting expeditions during the Japanese occupation served to depress numbers even further.

Villagers continued to look towards the state, as they always had, to defend them and their livestock against tiger attacks. Yet, by the 1930s, the only confirmed cases of the animals being captured or killed were taking place in North Hamgyong province.

It was only with the ejection of the Japanese from the peninsula in 1945 that some of the first conservation measures were enacted. In 1947, the DPRK banned any unlicensed hunts of tigers, along with bears and leopards. It was a short reprieve.

“I underestimated the possible problems… which we could meet starting work in North Korea”

Bombing campaigns by both sides in the Korean War decimated forests up and down the peninsula, severely restricting available habitat for tigers. This effectively left isolated northeast of the DPRK, close to the Sino-Soviet border, as the only plausible area where the animals might continue to survive.

One last sighting is reputed to have been made in the late 1950s by a team of Soviet and North Korean scientists in the area of Mt Paektu. Another Siberian tiger was gifted by the DPRK to the Prague Zoo in 1967, although it is possible that this animal originated from the Soviet Far East.

Thereafter, the presence of tigers on the peninsula devolved to the realm of informed speculation. In 1979, the Fauna Protection Society received a letter from a correspondent in North Korea asserting that conservation measures taken around Mt Paektu had resulted in about 50 tigers living in that area, “a considerable increase on the estimate of 10-20 when the republic was established.”

Without confirmation by international science organizations, however, the best chance of seeing a tiger on the Korean peninsula will still entail a trip to the zoo or local wildlife sanctuary.

Even if they are not currently present in the DPRK, Miquelle believes that making the border areas readily accessible to tigers could enhance the recovery of the species.

“The thing that’s important in terms of tiger conservation in this part of the world is that tiger densities are extremely low,” he explains, concurrent with the low numbers of ungulates present in what has always been, historically, the most northerly part of the species’ range. An individual Siberian tiger therefore roams over a huge area in search of prey, with males known to have territories of over 1000km.

“Korea represents another landscape where more tigers could exist.”

By demarcating new reserves in the Russian Far East and northern China, conservationists like Miquelle have successfully brought the Siberian tiger back from the brink of extinction. In his opinion, a similar recovery of the population might be possible if the North Korean government institute basic protective measures. Then, he says, “tigers will naturally move across the Tumen river back into the Korean peninsula.”

There is a small chance that they may have done so already. In 1991, tiger tracks leading from the North Korean border were discovered outside a Chinese village. In 2015, it was reported that a female with two cubs was spotted crossing the Tumen River into the DPRK from Russia by local border guards.

While the sightings are not evidence of a permanent population living on the Korean peninsula, it is certainly gratifying to think that, many years ago or yesterday, new tigers may be treading both sides of the riverbank, searching, perhaps, for a new home in an old kingdom.

However, there is no need to worry. Experts say the effect of a volcanic eruption is temporary; the forest will eventually recover naturally, and fast, and wildlife will thrive once more, ensuring that the cycle of life goes on.

Natural disasters like flash floods, landslides, droughts, forest fires, or worse, volcanic eruptions, underscore the need to preserve as many key biodiversity areas as possible to ensure the recovery of degraded ecosystems.

These key biodiversity areas would provide shelter to animal wildlife in the event of disasters and would also become the source of seeds to be dispersed by nature’s best farmers—the birds, the bees and bats—later on.

Volcano country

The Philippines sits on a unique tectonic setting ideal for volcano formation, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs).

The entire archipelago is surrounded by subducting plates as manifested by the trenches that are related to volcano formation, the Phivolcs, an agency of the Department of Science and Technology, said in its official web site.

There are 24 active and 26 potentially active volcanoes in the Philippines, including Mayon Volcano.

Also known as Mount Mayon, the popular volcano, a world-renowned natural wonder because of its perfect, symmetrical conical shape, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world.

The most destructive eruption of the Mayon Volcano occurred on February 1, 1814, during which volcanic debris—mostly dark ash devastated the town of Cagsawa. The trees around it burned and the rivers that sustain life around it were severely damaged.

Ash accumulated to 9 meters in depth. During the eruption, 1,200 locals in Albay province died, according to Mayon Volcano’s historical records available in various literatures attributed to the accounts of the Phivolcs.

Natural park

Although deadly, the enchanting volcano is the centerpiece of the Mayon Volcano Natural Park, which covers a total land area of 5,775.7 hectares.

It is first protected as a National Park in 1938 but in 2000 it was reclassified as Natural Park by virtue of Proclamation 412 signed on November 21, 2000.

The volcano is in the province of Albay and is shared by eight cities and municipalities, namely, Camalig, Daraga, Guinobatan, Legazpi City, Ligao City, Tabaco City, Malilipot and Santo Domingo.

The peak of the Mayon Volcano is the highest elevation in the entire Bicol region at 2,462 meters or 8,077 feet.

Heritage site

The Mayon Volcano is a central property of the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) Albay Biosphere Reserve.

The Mayon Volcano Natural Park (MVNP) is included in the tentative list of Unesco World Heritage Site.

“For its height, unrivaled shape and remarkably symmetrical contours, Mayon Volcano was believed by the pre-Hispanic Bicolanos to be the abode of their ancestors and, thus, its confines were subjected to taboo, including violation of its natural resources and even climbing its peak. It was also held as the sacred mountain of both the deity Mayong and Gugurang, the supreme god of Bicolano animist beliefs,”the Unesco said in its web site.

The beauty of the volcano has inspired local artists, allowing culture and arts to flourish in the region. Because it is active, having erupted over 50 times in the last century, it has caused devastation in surrounding areas.

Nevertheless, its frequent eruption has made people living around it more resilient to natural disasters.

Biodiversity profile

The natural park is home to 156 floral species belonging to 36 families and 83 species of trees, including the single dipterocarp found in the area, locally known as baguatsa or gisok-gisok (Hopea philippinensis); and one near-threatened species from the rare family Nepentheceae, the pitcher plant.

Plant biodiversity found within the park is composed of 71 woody species belonging to 49 genera and 33 families. About 32 percent of these species are endemic, while others are indigenous.

It is a habitat for 104 species of land vertebrates, including 57 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians, 24 species of reptiles and 13 species of mammals.

Of the 13 mammal species, seven are endemic of which three are listed as vulnerable: the Philippine brown deer, Philippine warty pig and giant golden-crowned flying fox.

The bird fauna includes 37 endemic species with three species listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list: the nearly threatened Luzon bleeding heart, vulnerable Philippine eagle-owl and the critically endangered Philippine cockatoo.

The 10 amphibian fauna are all endemic frog species with four listed in the IUCN red list: the nearly threatened Luzon fanged frog, Luzon forest ground frog and Guenther’s forest frog, and the vulnerable banded pygmy tree frog.

The MVNP also houses one endemic butterfly, seven endemic stick insects and nine endemic spiders in the registered insect and arachnid fauna.

These were the considerations submitted by the Philippine government to the Unesco to include the MVNP in the tentative list of Unesco World Heritage Site.

A separate profile prepared by the Biodiversity Management Bureau’s (BMB) Parks and Wildlife Division of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) revealed that there are several rivers and creeks within the MVNP.

These are the Maagolgol, Bulawan, Bangliwan, Baranghaun, Bariw and Buang rivers; and the Miraya, Sabangan, Cabcab, Sidon, Uyangan, Pepe, Angtol, Ogob, Manadela, Mabalnos, Magsapit, Magasadit, Subangan, Tabiguian and Tancopan creeks.

Its biological features are also unique. The area is predominantly dominated by dwarf trees, grasses and few dipterocarp trees not fit for commercial purposes.

Wild pigs, civet cats and monitor lizards, likewise, thrive within the park.

Threats and danger

With the unpredictability of volcanic eruptions, such as the current activity of Mayon Volcano, Science Undersecretary Dr. Renato U. Solidum Jr. for disaster-risk reduction and climate change said there are strong possibilities that lava flowing out of the crater would eventually block and spill over the gullies.

The impact of a volcanic eruption to its surrounding environment, Solidum added, depends on the mineral deposit emitted by the volcano. Although deadly, most of the time, these minerals emitted by the volcano are beneficial to the environment. The ash spewed by Mayon that is currently covering Guinobatan town would block the gullies and spill over to farmlands.

“Fortunately, there are no farms along the path of the lava,” said Solidum, who is also the officer in charge of the Phivolcs.

Areas covered by thick ash, lava, volcanic rocks and other debris would be rendered useless for agriculture for years, he added.

The lava would kill forest vegetation—trees, shrubs and grass—and cover vast portions of some rivers and creeks, damaging the ecosystem.

The ashfall, which is common, during volcanic eruptions, often has little negative impact on the environment, except for the temporary air pollution.

In fact, Solidum said, later on the ash will be beneficial to the soil as the mineral deposit spread over vast land areas will replenish the soil cover with minerals and make it fertile in the long run.

Years after a volcanic eruption, the threat of lahar remains as heavy rains would eventually wash away downstream the debris accumulated on top of the hills, potentially “killing” rivers and adversely affecting other water bodies. However, again, Solidum said ecosystems affected by volcanic eruption will eventually recover as the soil becomes fertile.

“In general, a volcanic eruption has its benefits. Besides enhancing soil fertility, it also promotes tourism,” he said.

Unless covered by lava or lahar flow, trees in the forest would grow back, he added, agreeing to the observation that despite the frequency of Mayon’s eruption, its lush forest eventually bounces back and sustains life because of the fertility of the soil brought by the minerals sprinkled by the volcanic eruption.

Effect on biodiversity

A volcanic eruption often has an adverse environmental impact that threatens the biological diversity near the volcano, the country’s top biodiversity official said.

Director Theresa Mundita S. Lim of the DENR-BMB said as ashfall, lava or lahar affect forest and forest vegetation, animal wildlife tends to migrate or transfer to safer grounds.

“Volcanic eruption affects biodiversity as it affects the vegetation and the animal wildlife species around the area that are not mobile,” Lim said.

“What is important,” she added, “is to protect the remaining biodiversity-rich areas which can serve as shelter and sanctuary of natural pollinators and seed dispersers that will evacuate from the affected areas.”

According to Lim, even a massive volcanic eruption will not cause the extinction of plant or animal species for as long as the same species continue to exist in other areas.

Areas that are not affected by the volcanic eruption, she said, will be the source of seeds and seedlings of, hopefully, native species of plants and trees that will regenerate the forest and lure back animal wildlife that were lost from the eruption.

“On the positive side, the soil will be very fertile and will allow natural regeneration to take place more quickly,” she added.

In the case of affected areas in Albay, she said she expects the population or distribution of animal wildlife to drop, albeit temporarily.

Animal species that could not move quickly, she said like amphibians, flightless insects and arachnids, could easily detect danger and transfer to safe grounds long before a volcanic eruption occurs.

“In any case, if there are other areas in Albay or the Bicol region where the same plant species can still be found, then we still have sources for propagation and restoration. All we need are the birds and the bees and bats,” she said.

“What is important is that people are aware of these areas so we can exert more effort in protecting these identified alternative natural gene-pool sites,” she explained."~[]

But now, the health of this rare rhino is failing, and the subspecies might be one step closer to extinction.

Sudan, a 45-year-old male northern white rhino, is suffering from a nasty infection on his back right leg, which festered underneath an age-related ailment he developed last year. This new infection is not responding to treatment, and his keepers are considering euthanasia if the pain gets to be too much for him. (Read: ""To Rescue or Not, That is the Question With Distressed Animals"")

""It has been a struggle,"" says Kaddu Sebunya, president of the African Wildlife Foundation. ""We're so concerned that the male rhino is now ailing, and we might lose him. We're in a hopeless situation.""

View Images A platoon of armed guards watch over Sudan, one of the last northern white rhinoceroses brought from a zoo in the Czech Republic in an effort to save the almost extinct species. Photograph by Ami Vitale, Nat Geo Image Collection

""This is a very good example of Africa losing the heritage,"" says Sebunya, who is based in Nairobi, Kenya, but from Uganda. ""How can we explain this to the next generation of Africans? We can't be so arrogant and neglect other African species.""

Slipping Away

Even from this shrunken population, northern white rhino numbers continue to dwindle. In November 2015, a 41-year-old female northern white rhino named Nola had to be euthanized at the San Diego Zoo because of a string of painful illnesses. A few months earlier in July of that same year, Nabiré, a 31-year-old female, died at a zoo in the Czech Republic after complications from a ruptured cyst. A 34-year-old male named Suni died in October 2014 due to natural causes.

Natural breeding doesn't seem to be a viable option at this point, and it's practically impossible unless a male can be found in the wild. But that situation is unlikely, so scientists have turned to the lab for ideas on how to save this dying species. They've harvested sex cells from the living rhinos and have made steps toward in vitro fertilization with southern white rhino surrogates. But this effort could take more than a decade. (Related: read about how scientists get rare animals to mate.)

Orphaned By Poachers, a Baby Rhino Makes a New Friend WATCH: In South Africa's Pilanesberg National Park, a baby rhino was orphaned by poachers, but with the kindness and hard work of park staff and animal welfare organizations, she's now in a safe home, and even has a new friend.

What About Southern White Rhinos?

White rhinos are one of five species of rhinoceros. They're further divided into two subspecies: northern and southern white rhinos. Northern white rhinos are smaller than southern ones, with straight backs, flat skulls, no grooves between their ribs, hairy ears and tails, and squat front horns. Southern white rhinos are larger, have concave skulls and backs with pronounced shoulder humps, more overall body hair, grooves between their ribs, and longer front horns.

Like their northern counterparts, southern white rhinos have faced similar population declines. At the turn of the century, there were only a handful of the subspecies left—they're historically native to parts of southern Africa. Government conservation efforts have helped to revitalize the population in South Africa to some 20,000 rhinos, thanks to breeding and relocation programs, as well as controlled but controversial sport hunting.

The lion, which once roamed across southwest Asia but is now restricted to the 1,400 square kilometre (545 square mile) Gir sanctuary in Gujarat state, was listed as critically endangered in 2000, with its population under threat due to hunting and human encroachment on its habitat.

A recent unofficial count found more than 600 lions in the area, up from 523 in a 2015 census, Gujarat’s chief minister Vijay Rupani said.

“Our efforts for lion conservation with support of local people have yielded good results. The number of lions now in Gujarat has reached the 600 mark,"" Rupani said.

In the late 1960s only about 180 Asiatic lions were thought to survive but an improvement in numbers prompted conservationists to raise their assessment to endangered in 2008.

The population is currently growing at about two percent a year, according to A.P. Singh, a state forest and wildlife conservationist.

The cats are cousins of the African lion — they are believed to have split away 100,000 years ago — but are slightly smaller and have a distinctive fold of skin along their bellies.

They are a major tourist attraction in Gujarat where in the past they were the target of poachers.

Priyavrat Gadhvi, a member of Gujarat’s wildlife board, credited conservation schemes, well-trained staff and vets as well as help from farmers for the recovery in numbers.

“There is tremendous support from the local population in Gujarat who are tolerant despite lions attacking their cattle. This is coupled with effective conservation management and skilled staff at ground level,"" he told AFP.

Gadhvi predicted a “steady growth"" in numbers in coming years. The next official census will be in 2020.

Conservationists have suggested relocating some of the cats to another sanctuary, to reduce human-animal conflict and avoid the risk of the Asiatic lion being wiped out by disease or a natural disaster.

together bring approximately close possible “to point island still provide ecosystem functioning required limited developmental activity sustain native life system made boracay boracay”~"It’s all hands on deck to save the ailing Boracay, an island paradise in the Western Visayas region.

Boracay is the country’s top tourist destination and known is for its white sand beaches and pristine waters.

The island in municipality of Malay, Aklan province, has obviously exceeded its carrying capacity as it continues to draw local and foreign tourists from all over the world.

Besides water pollution, which has affected water quality in some of the beaches, Boracay is also facing a serious threat because of the buildings that mushroom in timberlands, wetlands and beachfront.

This resulted in the degradation of important ecosystems that otherwise would ensure sustainable ecotourism in the island paradise.

Actually, there is more to the white-sand beaches and pristine waters in Boracay which most tourists, and even local communities, failed to appreciate.

Biodiversity experts are now on a mission to save Boracay’s biological diversity and restore the valuable ecosystem services to which it owes much of its ecotourism values, Director Theresa Mundita S. Lim of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources’s (DENR) Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) said.

Boracay’s forest

The remaining forest over limestone, beach forests and mangroves on Boracay are uniquely distributed across the island in barangays Yapak, Balabag and Manoc-Manoc, according to the DENR-BMB head in a telephone interview on February 27.

The largest remaining patch of limestone forest is found in the northern section of the island in Barangay Yapak. It represents the largest remaining limestone forest in the Negros-Panay Faunal region.

In Barangay Manoc-Manoc, on the eastern side of the island, a huge concentration of mangrove belonging to four different species can be found.

Sonneratia alba, or perepat or mangrove apple, the most adapted mangrove species on the island based on its distribution in the mangrove forest, is the dominant species on the island.

High-value biodiversity sites

The country’s top biodiversity official said Boracay Island has high-value biodiversity sites.

The only colony of flying foxes on Panay Island roosts in the limestone forest of Yapak. Flying fox colony comprise of three species—critically endangered golden-crowned flying fox, large flying fox and the common island flying fox.

Boracay is home to the puka shell, a unique shell to which one of the famous beaches was named after—the Puka Shell Beach. It is adjoining the limestone forest of Barangay Yapak, which is relatively pristine and home to the green sea or marine turtles.

Boracay caves

Boracay also has several caves, which experts say, are special ecosystems within an ecosystem.

According to the DENR-BMB, the only colony of flying foxes on Panay Island roosts in the limestone forest of Yapak.

Three of the five caves on Boracay Island were already classified.

Lapu-Lapu’s Paradise Cave in Barangay Balabag is a Class 1 cave; the Ilig-Ilagan Cave in Sitio Ilig-Ilagan in Barangay Yapak is Class 2; and Crystal Cave also in Sitio Ilig-Ilagan in Barangay Yapak is Class 3.

According to the DENR-BMB’s Cave Classification Manual, Class 1 caves are those with delicate and fragile geological formations, threatened species, archeological and paleontological values, and in extremely hazardous conditions. Among its allowable uses are mapping, photography, educational and scientific purposes.

Class 2 caves have portions, that have hazardous conditions and contain sensitive geological, archeological, cultural, historical and biological values or high-quality ecosystem.

Hazardous caves are “off limits” and only experienced cavers or guided educational tours or visits are allowed.

Class 3 caves are generally safe. They have no known threatened species, archeological, natural history, cultural and historical values. They may be used for economic purposes, such as gathering of guano and edible birds nest collection.

All of Boracay’s classified caves are target for Management Effectiveness under Presidential Development Plan 2017-2022.

The Balabag caves in barangays Balabag, Yapak and the dark side of Paradise Cave in Barangay Balabag remain unclassified.

Each of the classified caves on Boracay Island have unique features.

The Bat Cave is home to the Karstarma philippinarum, a new species of karst-dwelling crab, besides being the dwelling of the four different species of bats that can be found on the island.

The Bat Cave has abundant stalactites and draperies bats, birds, reptiles, crabs, cricket, spider, pseudo scorpions and ants; connects to the sea; pool connected to the sea The Crystal and the dark side of Paradise Cave are also home to bats, crickets, spiders and pseudo scorpions.

Wetland ecosystems

There used to be nine identified wetland areas within the forestland areas of Boracay Island.

However, lately, four of the wetlands were “nowhere to be found” at shown by latest satellite images.

Hotels, resorts and informal settlers have encroached on the wetlands.

Early this month, Environment Secretary Roy A. Cimatu vowed to recover the “missing” wetlands.

The wetlands are in the forestland areas in barangays Yapak, Balabag and Manoc-Manoc.

According to the DENR, the wetlands on Boracay Island are composed of a complex of marshland, mangrove swamp and lagoon. These wetlands provide important ecosystem functions. Besides being catch basins, they also prevent flooding.

The destruction of the wetlands—which were backfilled for building construction—is being eyed as the reason for flooding that is now being experienced in some parts of Boracay.

Coastal and marine biodiversity

According to the DENR, Boracay is blessed with rich coastal and marine ecosystem—corals, seagrass and mangrove.

Based on its topographic map, coral reef fringes the entire island of Boracay. Seagrass on the other hand, was only observed in Balabag East, Manoc-Manoc East and Balusbos.

It has nine locally managed marine parks or marine-protected areas, which doubles as the designated scuba diving sites.

“Within these marine parks, fishing, collection of corals and other marine products, dropping of anchors, dispensing of motor oil and other pollutants, belching and vandalizing, and scraping of corals are prohibited, while snorkeling and diving are allowed,” Lim said.

Issues and threats

Lim said among the issues that need to be addressed on the island are threats to primary roosting sites of flying foxes which are within the 80-hectare property of the Boracay Property Holdings Inc. (BPHI).

She bared that the master development plan of BPHI covers its 17-hectare property in the Barangay Yapak in Malay.

The DENR Western Visayas region has earlier proposed the declaration of the flying fox roosting sites, including the adjoining inland and coastal areas, as Critical Habitat.

The initiative, however, did not materialize due to the refusal of the landowners and developers. Instead a memorandum of understanding was entered into by DENR-Western Visayas, BPHI and LGU-Malay.

Moreover, the flying fox habitat has been declared as “No Flying Zone” for helicopters.

Lim noted that strict prohibition of cutting natural grown trees without prior clearance or permit and observance of 200-meter buffer zone from the flying fox roosting site were integrated in the Sangguniang Bayan Resolution.

In March 2008 the DENR in Western Visayas noted that the destruction of the wetlands on Boracay Island is one of the major causes of flooding in the area.

Illegal reclamation

In a February 2008 report, a wetland area in Sitio Mangayad, Barangay Manoc-Manoc, which used to be connected to the Dead Forest, was reported to be illegally reclaimed by the Boracay Crown Regency Hotel and Convention Center without a valid environmental compliance certificate.

A cease and desist order was issued against the property developer, but a civil case was filed by J. Kings and Sons Co. Inc. against a concerned DENR personnel on February 29, 2008.

Besides the destruction of wetland ecosystems, the indiscriminate dumping of household wastes in nearby wetlands flowing into Darkside of Paradise Cave, poaching of bats in Bat Cave and Crystal Cave, and the degradation of speleothems (blackening) due to irresponsible human activities in Crystal Caves were reported by the DENR Western Visayas.

The DENR earlier reported the occurrence of algal blooms due to eutrophication (excessive richness of nutrients in the body of water due to runoff from the land, which causes the death of animal life from lack of oxygen) from improper sewer disposal and other organic refuse, something Boracay is now beginning to be associated with.

Lim said there is also a need to address the illegal collection and overharvesting of puka shells in the area. She noted that the shells have very important ecosystem function, and its extinction may cause ecological imbalance and affect the network of coastal and marine ecosystems.

Way forward

The official said the DENR-BMB team is still conducting a comprehensive assessment in the area and will come up with various recommendations to save its unique biodiversity and ecosystems.

“Boracay’s biodiversity has clearly been impacted by unsustainable development. This is already evident in the decline of the population of species in the area, the loss of ecosystem services from healthy wetland ecosystems, the loss of marine habitats and biological resources; the damages in the unique ecological features on the island, like caves and rock formations,” Lim said.

“What we need to assess now is: Are these damages or destruction irreversible or can we still do something to restore them? At this time, I think we need to be hopeful,” she added.

According to Lim, while the DENR-BMB may no longer be able to restore the biodiversity of Boracay to its original state, various stakeholders can all work together to bring it as approximately close as possible “to the point where the island can still provide ecosystem functioning required for limited developmental activities and sustain the native life system which made Boracay, Boracay.”"~[]

A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of every 24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times a day. It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant panda's daily dietary needs, and it hungrily plucks the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function rather like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds or rodents as well.

Behavior and Habitat

Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool and wet—just as pandas like it. They may climb as high as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer season.

Pandas are often seen eating in a relaxed sitting posture, with their hind legs stretched out before them. They may appear sedentary, but they are skilled tree-climbers and efficient swimmers.

Breeding and Population

Giant pandas are solitary. They have a highly developed sense of smell that males use to avoid each other and to find females for mating in the spring. After a five-month pregnancy, females give birth to a cub or two, though they cannot care for both twins. The blind infants weigh only 5 ounces at birth and cannot crawl until they reach three months of age. They are born white, and develop their much loved coloring later."~[]

But when he died on Monday night, the news was met with international dismay.

The 45-year-old male rhino had been living under armed guard at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Earlier this month, Sudan developed an infection on his back right leg. He had already been suffering from age-related complications, and the infection worsened his condition.

Now, only two female northern white rhinos remain at the conservancy—the last of their kind on Earth.

Sudan, the Last Remaining Male White Rhino, Has Died

Is All Hope Lost?

Sudan's death is largely seen as the final signature on the species' death warrant.

There was a major conservation push to help Sudan produce an offspring. In one last ditch effort to raise money for the rhino's care, conservationists created a Tinder profile for Sudan.

Documenting Sudan and the species decline was a major project for National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale.

""Today, we are witnessing the extinction of a species that had survived for millions of years but could not survive mankind,"" Vitale wrote in an Instagram post sharing the news.

Vitale was with Sudan when the rhino was transferred from a zoo in the Czech Republic to the Kenya reserve in 2009. It was thought that the African climate and having more room to roam would stimulate the rhinos to breed. (Meet the heroes who protect the last northern white rhinos.)

Because he is past reproductive age and the two females are unable to produce offspring naturally, scientists were attempting to breed a new rhino in a lab.

Sex cells were harvested from the living northern white rhinos, and scientists are hoping to use IVF to impregnate southern white rhino surrogates. The technology to pull this off is still being perfected.

""There's no guarantee that [IVF] will work,"" says Philip Muruthi, vice president of species protection at the African Wildlife Foundation. And he adds that it's extremely expensive and could cost more than $9 million.

""This is a bitter lesson of species conservation,"" says Muruthi. He notes that, while protection is costly, ""the costs of recovery are even higher.""

Rhinos in Africa

In 2014, there were only seven of the sub species on the planet—all in zoos. By the summer of 2015, the number had dwindled to four; a few months later there were only three.

But when the northern white rhino population began to decline, it was lightning fast.

In Sudan's last days, rangers at Ol Pejeta kept the three rhinos under 24/7 armed guard. Despite the species precipitous conservation status, the animals face an intense threat from poaching.

Like elephants, rhinos in Africa are aggressively hunted for their lucrative horns and skin.

In 2013, another rhino subspecies, the western black rhino, was declared extinct. The eastern black rhino, numbering around a thousand, could be the next rhino species facing extinction."~[]

But perhaps few were as personally struck as the caretakers who had the crucial job of protecting his life.

A team of veterinarians, conservationists, and armed guards watched over the critically endangered animal at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.

On Saturday morning, the conservancy held a memorial service for Sudan, whose death leaves just two of his kind remaining on Earth.

The ceremony, a tribute to his life, began with the Kenyan national anthem, a poem, and a minute of silence. (See heart-wrenching photos of rhinos fighting to survive.)

""Fare thee well Sudan,"" the conservancy posted on its Facebook page. ""You have done your work to highlight the plight of rhino species across the world; now the onus is on us to ensure that rhino populations thrive across our planet.""

One of the speakers was James Mwenda, who was among Sudan's keepers and spoke about the rhino's life, urging the world not to let his death be in vain. A carrot—the rhino's favorite food—was placed on a ceremonial plaque.

The guest of honor, Cabinet Secretary for Wildlife and Tourism Najib Balala, also spoke at the event.

Poaching Pandemic

Sudan's health began failing early this year. In early March, he developed an infection on his back leg that, combined with age-related complications, proved too much for the rhino to overcome. The conservancy euthanized him after realizing he was barely able to stand.

Sudan, the Last Remaining Male White Rhino, Has Died

While Sudan's death paints a grim picture, the conservancy doesn't want to lose sight of the conservation issues Sudan brought to the forefront.

Rhino horns, used in some Chinese medicines and crafts, are some of the most lucrative animal parts o the illegal wildlife market. (Read National Geographic's 2016 investigation of the deadly trade.)

Just over 29,000 rhinos are left on Earth, but before the 19th century, they numbered in the hundreds of thousands. Rhino poaching has dramatically increased over the past decade.

""It’s a war,"" said Xolani Nicholus Funda, chief ranger at Kruger National Park, said in the 2016 article. ""That’s our frustration. The rhino war—it’s like drugs.""

Shining a Spotlight

Last April, Sudan famously helped spread awareness about rhino conservation when his keepers created a profile for him on a dating app.

Seemingly lighthearted, the profile was intended to raise money to fund artificial insemination research.

Sudan's daughter and granddaughter are the only two remaining northern white rhinos. One is infertile and the other is not able to reproduce on her own. The genetic material of several northern white rhinos, including Sudan's, has been stored away."~[]

From a conservation perspective, this does not sound like a big deal. Sudan was one old rhino. He was well past breeding age. So why did his death make headlines?

Sudan was the last surviving male northern white rhinoceros, a subspecies known to scientists as Ceratotherium simum cottoni that went extinct in the wild about 20 years ago thanks to poaching. He was captured and removed from the wild in 1975, the last wild-caught northern white rhino. Sudan’s daughter Najin, and granddaughter Fatu, are now the only two left, and they are both old and incapable of reproduction even if they had a mate.

It is a strange situation. On the one hand, it matters a lot. The northern white rhino is extinct, it just doesn’t know it yet. Conservationists refer to such populations as “the living dead”.

On the other hand, does it really matter? Despite persistent misreporting in the media (and some debate among scientists) the northern white is generally recognised as “only” a subspecies of the white rhinoceros. It is survived by its relative the southern white rhino, Ceratotherium simum simum, around 20,000 of which remain. The species as a whole is not currently endangered.

Resurrection?

The importance of Sudan’s actual death remains unclear, partly because it seems increasingly possible to bring his subspecies back to life. The northern white rhino may be resurrected by Jurassic Park-style technology. That would require conservationists to collect eggs from the remaining females and develop IVF techniques that are as yet unproven on rhino.

Jason Gilchrist , Author provided

DNA has been stored from 13 northern white rhino that died in recent years, including Sudan, and it would be combined with similarly-frozen eggs and sperm. The embryos produced would then be implanted within surrogate female southern white rhino. I recently spoke to Professor Thomas Hildebrandt, a global leader in conservation reproduction and pioneer of this technique, and he was confident it would work.

If these optimistic plans play out, the first northern white rhino calf born since the year 2000 could be produced before the death of the two remaining females. An alternative would be to produce a genetically-engineered baby rhino that is a hybrid of both northern and southern species. If plans to resurrect the extinct woolly mammoth via hybridisation with Indian elephants are possible, then a white rhino hybrid is not unachievable.

Nevertheless, we are talking not about saving a subspecies from extinction, but resurrecting an extinct subspecies – a much more challenging proposition.

Southern white rhinos to the rescue

The second issue, that clouds the importance of the almost certain extinction of the northern white rhino, is that the white rhino survives through its southern subspecies which may (with help) be able to replace the northern white rhino in its historical range across central Africa. In doing so, it could fill the vacant ecological niche.

Jason Gilchrist , Author provided

We, as a society, have to be pragmatic and economic with the resources available to protect wild animals. Can we justify spending an estimated £7.1m (US$10m) to try to bring back to life a subspecies from stored DNA with limited genetic diversity? Even if the animals were all alive and breeding, there would still be fears of the “founder effect” that can occur when a population is started from just a few individuals, with some traits lost and others dominant within the resulting population.

As a near-extinct subspecies, the conservation argument for continued investment to save the population is based upon whatever adaptive genetic diversity it holds that differentiates it from the other subspecies. But it is not clear exactly what genetically-useful traits are found in the sample of 13 northern white rhinos that are not also present in the southern white.

To be direct, if millions of pounds can be raised to try and resurrect the northern white rhino, should it not instead be invested in protecting the southern white rhino (still at risk from poaching)? Or alternatively, direct the money towards even more vulnerable Asian rhinos.

Living museum exhibits

It is easy to see why cutting edge reproductive technology is so appealing now that the planet’s sixth mass extinction crisis is well under way.

Jason Gilchrist , Author provided

But the only economic and practical long-term solution to biodiversity loss is to conserve wildlife in the wild and to prevent it from reaching the sorry state of the northern white rhino. After all, if humans cannot save a species in nature while it is alive, what future for animals that we manufacture? My worry is that they would simply be living museum exhibits, destined to live out their lives in zoos, with habitat loss or poaching preventing life in the wild. Where would this end? Do we want to repopulate the world with lab-produced engineered organisms?

It is difficult to be positive about our ability to manage these incredible animals to survival. We have already failed the northern white rhino, let us ensure that we do not let down the remaining rhinoceros species and all the other endangered animals out there that need our help."~[]

His conviction came under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972.

Here is a 10-point guide to understanding what Salman Khan was convicted for:

1. Salman was convicted under Section 9 of the WPA.

2. The text of this section reads, ""Prohibition of Hunting. No person shall hunt any wild animal specified in Schedule I, II, III and IV except as provided under section 11 and section 12."" Salman Khan was found guilty of hunting an animal listed in Schedule I.



3. Schedule I is the highest level of protection that an animal can have under Indian law. It is this Schedule that provides ultimate protection to the National Animal (Royal Bengal Tiger), National Bird (Peafowl), other important animals like the Indian Lion and endangered species such as the Olive Ridley Turtle.



4. Schedules II, III and IV offer differing levels of protection to the animals and plants listed in them. The penalties for harming or killing these animals vary in severity with each Schedule.



5. The Blackbuck (Antelope cervicapra) is protected under the Schedule I. It is the second animal on the alphabetical list.



6. Sections 11 and 12 create exemptions for reasons of safety and scientific study. They give certain government officials the power to give permission to hunt animals that pose a threat to human life, for eg a man-eating tiger or lion. It also provides officials the power to give permission to hunt animals to be studied as part of scientific research or for the conservation. These exemptions clearly do not apply to Salman Khan's case.



7. Section 51 of the WPA lays out the penalties for any offences committed under the law. The basic punishment under this section is either imprisonment that can extend to three years or a fine of up to Rs 25,000, or both. But it is not under this provision that Salman Khan was given the 5-year sentence.



8. The judge could have given Salman Khan a sentence of 6 years, but gave him only 5 years. He also slapped a Rs 10,000 fine on the Bollywood star.



9. The provision that allowed the judge to sentence Salman to jail for 5 years to ""… where the offence committed is in relation to any animal specified in Scheduled I…, such offence shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than [one year] but may extend to six years and also with fine which shall not be less than [five thousand rupees].""



10. Another provision of Section 51 also ensures that Salman Khan cannot get any leniency for good behaviour, a good track record of public service or any other factor that is not connected with the crime. These concessions are allowed in Section 360 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) and under The Probation of Offenders Act of 1958.

Maybe.

In the 120 years since ""Dracula"" came on the scene and spooked us into believing bats are bad, we're beginning to get a grasp on the truth: Their voracious appetite for insects turns them into a living pesticide that saves farmers billions of dollars a year and helps rid our backyards of insects like mosquitoes, moths, grasshoppers, flies and beetles. Some species are critically important pollinators for crops ranging from bananas to agave.

Still, there is plenty of false fodder contributing to their scary reputation. Bats aren't flying mice. In fact, according to Bat Conservation International, they are more closely related to humans. Bats don't get tangled in your hair. Bats aren't blind. Of the three species out of 1,300 that feed on blood, only one targets mammals. All of these are limited to Latin America. (If you really want to know, they don't suck blood, they lap it ""like kittens with milk,"" BCI says on its website.)

Most importantly, bats are no more likely to get rabies than other mammals. However, in any given year, some bats likely do contract and develop the disease, said Dana Sanchez, wildlife specialist with Oregon State University Extension Service.

""People should report and avoid any contact with a bat that acts oddly, such as flying during the day, approaching people or crawling on the ground,"" she said ""It could be affected by rabies or another disease, such as white-nose syndrome.""

Report sightings to the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife or your local health department where there are professionals to advise you on the steps to take.

Bats need little encouragement to hang around. They roost in dead trees, caves and other dark, quiet places, including bat houses. You'll see them at dusk and can recognize them by their zigzagging flight pattern.

To attract them to your garden and to help with their conservation, construct a bat house or provide other roosting places, said Dan Crannell, an OSU Extension Master Gardener.

""One of the biggest problems that bats are facing right now is loss of habitat,"" he said. ""We can try to mitigate that with bat houses.""

Other factors threatening bats, Sanchez added, are wind energy development, white-nose syndrome and broad changes to water and foraging resources due to climate change.

Bat boxes resemble large bird houses but are open on the bottom and partitioned into several narrow spaces. For patterns, refer to Extension's publication called The Wildlife Garden: Create Roosts for Bats in Your Yard.

Of the 15 species of bats in Oregon, the most common are the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), long-legged bat (Macrophyllum macrophyllum) and big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus). The Western pipistrelle (Pipistrellus hesperus), the smallest bat in the U.S., weighs in at one-tenth of an ounce and can be found in Eastern Oregon.

Learn more about bats in Extension's Bats in the Garden and The Wildlife Garden: Little Brown Bats (Myotis lucifugus).

More bat facts

Bats are the only mammal capable of true flight.

Bats can be found everywhere in the world except some islands and the polar regions.

Bats hibernate in winter.

The size of bats is quite varied. The bumble bee bat in Asia has a wingspan of only 7 inches, while the giant golden-crowned flying fox in the tropics of Asia, Africa and Europe can have one of up to 6 feet.

Some bats are solitary and some live in colonies of 20 million.

In addition to insects, some bats feed on fish, frogs, lizards and fruit.

Many bats are listed as threatened or endangered.

More than 1,400 species listed as Endangered and Critically Endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature are threatened by tourism. This can be a consequence of habitat destruction caused by tourism development or disturbance caused by tourists.

The golden-capped fruit bat, for example, is an endangered species that is endemic to the Philippines. One of the major threats it faces is disturbance at the roost site caused by tourists. Not only can this disturbance stress the animals, it can also lead to the abandonment of pups. Together with other threats, such as deforestation, this disturbance contributes to pushing this and other species towards extinction.

Nature tourism can be a primary source of income for entire communities or even countries. For example, in 2010 nature tourism in Scotland was worth £1.4 billion and generated 39,000 jobs. £127m of that is attributable to wildlife watching alone.

Consequently, we need to find ways to manage these activities so that the targeted wildlife can continue to thrive and the businesses that depend on it can remain economically viable. This is not an easy task.

The first obstacle is a lack of data. It is difficult and expensive to “track” people during their recreational activities, especially over large areas and long periods of time. Surveys allow experts to ask people about their recreational activities, but they are expensive to run and the response rate can be poor.

A picture of hope

Here’s where social media can come to the rescue. Platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have billions of users, who share large amounts of information about their activities.

Flickr is a photo-sharing website that has been active since 2004. Most of the photographs uploaded onto Flickr have a time stamp indicating when the photo was taken. Some of them have geographical coordinates indicating where the photo was taken, too. Users can also add text to their photos, which gives an indication of their content.

Wildlife watching, and nature recreation in general, is closely associated with photography, making Flickr an ideal source of information to quantify these activities on a large scale and in fine detail.

As ideal as this may sound, however, Flickr data would be useless for conservation purposes if it didn’t reflect patterns of actual visitation. To address this, my co-authors and I compared the distribution in space and time of Flickr photographs to spatial and temporal trends from visitor statistics obtained from surveys.

We found that the monthly numbers of visitors to the Cairngorms National Park in Scotland obtained through surveys corresponded to the monthly numbers of people taking photographs in the Cairngorms National Park and sharing them on Flickr. Since not all tourists are social media users, there are fewer Flickr users than visitors, but the trends showed by the two datasets are very similar.

We found the same correspondence between the spatial distribution of geotagged Flickr photographs of wildlife taken in Scotland and the spatial patterns of wildlife watching activities according to an online Scotland-wide survey. Moreover, this relationship was true down to an area as small as 10km.

All the data used in this study are publicly available and were downloaded following the terms and conditions of the data provider (in this case Flickr). We did not use the actual photographs but only the data associated with them, which was completely anonymised so as to avoid any privacy issues.

How it works

By mapping where the most Flickr nature photographs were taken, we could then identify some of the most popular wildlife watching destinations in Scotland – and thus where certain species might face added pressure from tourism. Chanonry Point in the Moray Firth, for example, was identified as a hotspot for Flickr photographs of dolphins – and the beach is indeed one of the best locations in the UK to watch bottlenose dolphins from land, as is Aberdeen, which was also a hotspot for Flickr images of the mammals.

Meanwhile, a map of Flickr photographs of seals showed, among other locations, Forvie Nature Reserve in Aberdeenshire as a hotspot. This is an official seal haul-out site (a site on land where seals come ashore for resting, moulting or breeding) that now holds more than 1,000 grey seals.

Now we know that these areas are home to large numbers of animals and attract significant numbers of people eager to view them – so it is important to monitor these sites to avoid impacts on the wildlife.

The first obstacle on the path to managing nature tourism sustainably can be overcome by harnessing the power of the internet and social media. We can use this data to identify areas where wildlife is under strong pressure from recreational activities and intervene, perhaps preventing any significant impacts on the wildlife. We can also investigate whether nature recreation is helping countries to achieve biodiversity and sustainability targets, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. For example, we can look for associations between nature tourism growth and progress towards biodiversity and sustainability goals in different countries.

Wildlife watching is always an exciting experience and I want the next generations to be able to enjoy it.

These bushy-tailed tree dwellers resemble a cross between a raccoon and a fox, and are slightly larger than the domestic cat. About half of red pandas live in the Eastern Himalayas. Their unique markings, including a black belly and limbs and white faces, have made them a favorite of zoo-goers and unfortunately, those wanting to do them harm.

Poaching and illegal trade of the animals in Nepal has contributed to their decline, along with loss of habitat caused by deforestation. Red Panda Network works to stop the illegal red panda trade and hopes to create the first protected corridor for red pandas in eastern Nepal.

This year marks the ninth anniversary of the holiday. Zoos across the world have organized events to expose the illegal red panda supply chain and educate the public on why red pandas don’t make good pets and their need to stay in the wild. At the events, children can become Red Panda Rangers by helping to spread the word about the adorable creatures.

Help protect these precious mammals by sharing the message on social media with the hashtags #SaveTheRedPanda and #NoPandaPets, and check out 16 adorable photos of red pandas on Instagram below!

union fellow currently fellow echoing green foundation new york~"AS the world faces an increase of 1 degree Celsius to 1.5°C global warming by year 2030, the number of Earth’s life forms threatened with extinction has increased, the world’s global watchdog of flora and fauna, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), said in its September 2018 report.

In its latest Red List, the IUCN said an additional 26,000 species are threatened with extinction today, out of the 27 percent of all assessed species worldwide.

Of the number, 41 percent are amphibians, 5 percent mammals, 34 percent conifers, 13 percent birds, 31 percent sharks and manta rays, 33 percent corals and 27 percent selected crustaceans.

The IUCN Red List is the most comprehensive, objective global approach for evaluating the extinction risk of plant and animal species that started in the 1950s as a card index of species that were considered to be threatened with extinction.

Over time, the Red Data Books grew and transformed into the Red List to include more species. The ethos of the program also shifted to incorporate the status of all species, not limiting it to only those threatened with extinction.

Today, the IUCN Red List, regarded as the most influential source of information for species conservation in the world, holds conservation information for over 93,500 species of plants, animals and fungi, with a mission to increase the list to 160,000 species by 2020.

Biodiversity hot spots around the world

THERE are 35 biodiversity hot spots in the world where these threatened life species are located. These areas compose 2.3 percent of the Earth’s surface but have more than half of the world’s endemic plant species.

These are in the California Floristic province, Madrean Pine Oak Woodlands, Mesoamerica of North and Central America; Caribbean Islands; Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, Chilean Winter Rainfall Valdivian Forest, Tumbes Choco Magdalena and Tropical Andes in South America;

Mediterranean Basin in Europe; Cape Floristic Region, Coastal Forests of Eastern Africa, Eastern Afromontane, Guinean Forests of West Africa, Horn of Africa, Madagascar and Indian Ocean Islands, Maputuland Pondoland Albany, Succulent Karoo in Africa; Mountains of Central Asia; Eastern Himalayas, Nepal, India, Indo-Burma, India and Myanmar, Western Ghats and Sri Lanka in South Asia;

East Melanesian Islands, Philippines, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Polynesia-Micronesia, Eastern Australian Temperate Forests, Southwest Australia, Sundaland and Nicobar Islands of India, Wallacea all in Southeast Asia and Asia Pacific; Japan, Mountains of Southwest China in East Asia; Caucasus and Irano-Anatolian in East Asia.

These are considered hot spots because they are biogeographic regions with significant reservoir of biodiversity but threatened with destruction.

The purpose of biodiversity hot spots is not simply to identify regions that are of high biodiversity value, but to prioritize conservation spending.

Culprits behind ugly face of extinction

THE worst threat endangering biodiversity in the global hot spots is internal—citizen-initiated, aggressive, relentless, unethical to a point, God-less—destruction of habitat. As if the future does not matter.

Man has begun to overuse or misuse most of these natural ecosystems. Due to this “unsustainable” resource-use, the once productive forests and grasslands have been turned into deserts and wasteland have increased all over the world.

Mangroves have been cleared for fuelwood and prawn farming, which has led to a decrease in the habitat essential for breeding of marine fish.

Wetlands have been drained to increase agricultural land. These changes have grave economic implications in the longer term.

The current destruction of the remaining large areas of wilderness habitats, especially in the super diverse tropical forests and coral reefs, is the most important threat worldwide to biodiversity.

Scientists have estimated that human activities are likely to eliminate approximately 10 million species by the year 2050.

There are about 1.8 million species of plants and animals, both large and microscopic, known to science in the world at present.

The number of species, however, is likely to be greater by a factor of at least 10. Plants and insects, as well as other forms of life not known to science, are continually being identified in the worlds’ hot spots of diversity.

Unfortunately at the present rate of extinction, about 25 percent of the worlds’ species will undergo extinction fairly rapidly. This may occur at the rate of 10,000 to 20,000 species per year, 1,000 to 10,000 times faster than the expected natural rate!

Human actions could well exterminate 25 percent of the world’s species within the next 20 years or 30 years.

Much of this mega extinction spasm is related to human population growth, industrialization and changes in land-use patterns.

A major part of these extinctions will occur in “biorich” areas—such as tropical forests, wetlands and coral reefs. The loss of wild habitats due to rapid human population growth and short-term economic development are major contributors to the rapid global destruction of biodiversity.

Philippines, 18th most endangered biodiversity hot spot

THE Philippines—the world’s second-largest archipelago—is one of the few nations that is, in its entirety, both a hot spot and a megadiversity country, placing it among the top priority hot spots for global conservation.

But its unique biodiversity is threatened. Having the highest rates of discovery in the world with 16 new species of mammals discovered in the last 10 years, such endemism, however, may be lost faster than discovered.

Threatened are 9,250 vascular plant species, which includes gingers, begonias, gesneriads, orchids, pandans, palms and dipterocarps. Some 150 species of palms are included on the hot spot list and 70 percent of the 1,000 species of orchids found in the country.

Among its over 530 bird species, 35 percent or over 60 are threatened. These are found in seven Endemic Bird Area hot spots: Mindoro, Luzon, Negros and Panay, Cebu, Mindanao and the Eastern Visayas, the Sulu archipelago and Palawan.

The best-known endangered bird species is the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi, CR), the second-largest eagle in the world.

The Philippine eagle breeds only in primary lowland rain forest. Habitat destruction has extirpated the eagle everywhere, except on the islands of Luzon, Mindanao and Samar, where the only large tracts of lowland rain forest remain.

Today, the Philippine eagle’s total population is estimated at less than 700 individuals. Captive breeding programs have been largely unsuccessful; habitat protection is the eagle’s only hope for survival.

The other threatened endemic species are the Negros bleeding heart (Gallicolumba keayi, CR), Visayan wrinkled hornbill (Aceros waldeni, CR), scarlet-collared flowerpecker (Dicaeum retrocinctum, VU), Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor, CR), and Philippine cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia, CR).

With regards mammals, the tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis, CR), a dwarf water buffalo that lives only on Mindoro Island, is the most threatened. A century ago the population was10,000 individuals; today only a few hundred animals exist in the wild.

Other mammals are endangered, like the Visayan and Philippine warty pigs (Sus cebifrons, CR and S. philippensis, VU); the Calamianes hog-deer (Axis calamaniensis, EN) and the Visayan spotted deer (Rusa alfredi, EN), which has been reduced to a few hundreds on the islands of Negros, Masbate and Panay; and the golden-capped fruit bat (Acerodon jubatus, EN), which, as the world’s largest bat, has a wingspan up to 1.7 meters.

In the reptilian world, the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis, CR) is considered the most threatened crocodilian in the world. Other unique and threatened reptiles include Gray’s monitor (Varanus olivaceus, VU), the Philippine pond turtle (Heosemys leytensis, CR) and a newly discovered monitor lizard, Varanus mabitang, only the second monitor species known in the world to specialize on a fruit diet.

Among all amphibians, 22 are considered threatened, including the Philippine flat-headed frog (Barbourula busuangensis, VU), one of the world’s most primitive frog species.

With regards freshwater fishes, most threatened is Sardinella tawilis, a freshwater sardine found only in Taal Lake. Sadly, Lake Lanao, in Mindanao, seems likely to have become the site of one of the hot spots’ worst extinction catastrophes, with nearly all of the lake’s endemic fish species now almost certainly extinct.

Destruction of forests but decimated most of RP’s biodiversity

Forests, the leading natural habitat of the Philippines’s biodiversity, are rapidly disappearing.

By 2040, there may be no virgin forests, many forestry experts predict. Nonbelievers scoff at this, saying it is an exaggeration. But the figures cannot be wrong. The effects of deforestation are not figments of the imagination.

The rate of deforestation in the country is among the highest in the world. The worst deforestation happened during the period of 1990 to 1999, where 750,000 acres of virgin forest were lost.

Today, only 1.75 million acres remain of the nation’s virgin forests.

The loss was incredible. The rate of deforestation in that decade was almost 75,000 acres a year. It also came at a time when the logging ban was imposed in some select sites in the country.

As a result, flooding, soil erosion and degradation pegged at 100,000 tons of soil yearly, loss of species diversity and genetic material, loss of human lives and properties, and aesthetic and recreational loss were at their worst.

Much of the blame is on the government that, over the years, have passed laws favorable to logging concessions and implemented forest protection poorly. Government negligence has prompted the devastation of the forests.

Today, much of the remaining forests are still being invaded by commercial loggers.

Philippine forestry laws passed since 1930 have failed to provide adequate security provisions for virgin and secondary growth forests, thus, the forests had virtually no protection at all. For instance, there is only one forest guard for every 7,500 acres.

But even then, many official policies and strategies from the very start were faulty.

And many polices continue to be faulty.

The decision came two days after three Asiatic lions were run over by a goods train in Gir.

Here are the highlights of the project:

1. The main objective of this project is to work for the conservation of the world's last ranging free Asiatic lions population and ecosystem associated with it.

2. The minister said the total budget of the project for the next three years will be funded through a centrally sponsored scheme, the Development of Wildlife Habitat, with the contributing ratio of 60:40 for central and state share.

3. ""The Asiatic Lion Conservation Project will strengthen the ongoing measures for conservation and recovery of Asiatic Lion with the help of state-of-the-art techniques, regular scientific research studies, disease management, modern surveillance techniques,"" Union Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan said at a review meeting.

4. It will be supplemented with sufficient eco-development works ensuring a stable and viable Lion population in India.

5. Less than 50 lions survived in the Gir forests of Gujarat by late 1890's, the ministry said in a statement, adding, ""With timely and stringent protection offered by the state government and the Centre, Asiatic lions have increased to the current population of over 500.

6. Asiatic Lions which once ranged from Persia (Iran) to Palamau in Eastern India had almost been driven to extinction by indiscriminate hunting and habitat loss.

7. A single population of less than 50 lions persisted in the Gir forests of Gujarat by late 1890's. With stringent protection offered by the state and the central governments, Asiatic lions have increased to the current population of over 500.

8. The 2015 census showed a population of 523 Asiatic Lions in the Gir Protected Area Network of 1648.79 sq. km.

About Asiatic lions:

Lion is one of five pantherine cats inhabiting India, along with the Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, snow leopard and clouded leopard. It was also known as 'Indian lion' and 'Persian lion'. Asiatic Lions are listed as 'Endangered' under the IUCN Red List. Its population is restricted to the state of Gujarat in India.

In response to the mounting death toll among critically endangered Asiatic lions, India’s government has launched a project to save Asia’s last free-range population of lions in the state of Gujarat.

“The Asiatic Lion Conservation Project will strengthen the ongoing measures for conservation and recovery of Asiatic Lion with the help of state-of-the-art techniques, regular scientific research studies, disease management, modern surveillance techniques,” Harsh Vardhan, a government minister, said.

Unlike their cousins in Africa, Asiatic lions aren’t doing all that well in the wild. The last few Asiatic lions now live in Gir National Park and adjacent areas in Gujarat, where a recent viral outbreak led to the deaths of more than 30 lions within a matter of weeks.

The felines may have contracted the canine distemper virus from stray dogs, prompting conservationists to call for a relocation of a number of wild lions from the area in an effort to save them. “Lions could either have caught CDV directly from them or from other carnivores — hyenas, jackals or leopards,” Hari Shankar Singh, a member of India’s Wildlife Board, was quoted as saying.

Asiatic Lions which once roamed far and wide from Iran all the way to Eastern India, but they were nearly driven extinct a century ago by hunting and habitat loss. In 1913 there were a mere 20 wild lions left in 1913.

Thanks to conservation efforts, however, they now number around 500 animals in Gujarat. Yet that is twice the number that the protected area can support so many of the predators have been venturing outside the protected area, which places them at increased risks.

Since 2015 a number of lions have been hit by passing trains and trucks, while more than a dozen are known to have fallen into village wells. Several others have died of electrocution at electric fences erected by local farmers to keep wild animals out of their plots and away from their houses.

Just a few days ago three lions died after being run over by a goods train."~[]

blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is the largest animal known to have existed in history. These enormous marine mammals have been known to reach up to 110 feet (34 meters) long, and the largest individuals likely weigh at least 150 tons (136 metric tons), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries. That's a little more than twice the length of a school bus and more than three times the weight of a semitrailer truck.

""You never cease to be impressed by the force and presence of these animals,"" said Richard Sears, a marine biologist and founder of the Mingan Island Cetacean Study, a nonprofit research organization that studies marine mammals. The full enormity of a blue whale may not be obvious from above the water's surface, but ""when you're next to a blue whale underwater, it's magnificent,"" Sears said. ""That's when your heart gets pumping.""

Taxonomy and evolution

Blue whales belong to a group of whales called rorquals, which are baleen whales with folds or grooves in their skin that allow their mouths to expand to swallow larger volumes of water when feeding. Many scientists describe blue whales as belonging to one of three subspecies, with groups found in the Northern Hemisphere and the Antarctic, and a third, the pygmy blue whales (B. musculus brevicauda), in the Indian and Southwest Pacific oceans. Pygmy blue whales are smaller whales, but they may still grow to 79 feet (24 m) in length.

The distant ancestors of blue whales had legs and walked on land, but ventured into the water to find food. Over many generations, these creatures developed adaptations suitable for living in water full time, such as fins, blubber and blowholes. Although the fossil record is murky, research suggests that some of these animals lost their teeth and fed by sucking their prey into their mouths. These ancient, toothless whales are thought to have eventually developed baleen — brush-like plates with small gaps — to filter food out of the water they were sucking in.

Research published in 2017 revealed that blue whales likely began growing to such tremendous size only relatively recently, from an evolutionary standpoint — perhaps in just the past 3 million years.

Blue whales have been successful in reaching their humongous size because their water environment supports most of their mass compared to animals on land, and they've adapted to feed so efficiently on krill, Sears said. [Whale Album: Giants of the Deep]

Diet and habitat

Blue whales are found in oceans around the globe. Scientists keep track of populations in the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, as well as whales throughout the Southern Hemisphere.

The whales migrate long distances to find food in cold waters and rear calves in warmer areas during the coldest few months of the year. These trips extend from the tropics to the polar circles and cover thousands of miles.

Some whales have been spotted returning to the same locations year after year, but not always. Searching for whales by boat has its limitations, Sears said, so it often isn't clear to researchers if the ""missing"" whales just went somewhere else that year, or simply weren't seen by whale spotters.

Blue whales almost exclusively eat krill — small, shrimp-like creatures. The whales seek out large concentrations of their tiny prey, which they engulf in a large amount of water, sometimes spinning about as they do it. The water in one of those massive gulps weighs as much as the whale itself, Robert Shadwick, an animal biomechanics researcher at the University of British Columbia, previously told Live Science.

The whales push the water back out across their baleen filter, which catches the krill. Unlike toothed whales, blue whales lack teeth and instead have baleen, which are thin, semirigid plates that grow down from the top of the whale's mouth. The plates are lined up closely to one another and are made of a protein called keratin — the same protein that builds fingernails and hair. The amount of krill a blue whale captures in one gulp of water may provide nearly half a million calories of energy.

Life cycle

Scientists estimate that blue whales may live as long as 80 to 90 years. Sears has been tracking blue whales in the North Atlantic Ocean for over 40 years, and he continues to see some of the same individuals that he saw when he first started.

One of the reasons blue whales are able to live so long is their lack of predators. Blue whale calves are small enough that they're occasionally targeted by orcas, but adult whales are so large that even the most vicious ocean predators steer clear. Humans pose the biggest threat to a blue whale's survival.

Blue whales can communicate over long distances with extremely loud, low-pitched calls that are below the range of human hearing. Scientists are still learning about the context for these calls and mating behavior.

Blue whales appear to reach sexual maturity somewhere around 9 years old, but researchers and whale trackers have been unable to determine if there are specific breeding-ground regions for blue whales.

What scientists do know, however, is that mother blue whales usually give birth to single calves, which are 20 to 23 feet (6 to 7 m) long, and weigh up to 6,000 lbs. (2,700 kilograms). Calves nurse for six to eight months and may stay with their mothers until they are around 2 to 3 years old.

Conservation status

The World Wildlife Fund lists blue whales as endangered. Commercial whaling is no longer the major threat it once was, but climate change, pollution, human-made noise and shipping traffic are still concerns. Nonetheless, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), the global population of blue whales is increasing.

Sears estimates there may be anywhere from 10,000 to 18,000 blue whales worldwide. It's difficult for experts to determine a more exact population size because blue whales traverse such vast portions of the ocean, which makes them tough to track, Sears said. ""We don't really have a handle on it.""

And although blue whales are gigantic creatures, they're still really good at hiding from humans. The whales can frequently hold their breath for 20 minutes at a time and travel long distances in that time, which makes it difficult to follow them, even once they've been spotted, Sears said. ""The study areas we give ourselves can already be pretty broad in terms of humans, but in the scale of blue whales, it's a joke,"" he said.

Sears estimates that researchers may glimpse only 5 percent of the blue whale's life when they come close enough for observation. The remaining decades of a blue whale's life may become easier to document with technology like drones and improved satellite tags. It may take two or three generations of biologists, said Sears, before there is a ""comfortable"" understanding of blue whale behavior and social interactions.

With that in mind, we take a closer look at the biggest of them all…

The blue whale is the Largest animal ever, some specimens weighing in at a colossal 200 tonnes (440,000 lb), although 100–150 tonnes (200,000–300,000 lb) is the average. Even dinosaurs didn’t reach that size – for instance, it’s nearly 20 times heavier than a T. rex! The blue whale can grow up to 30 m (98 ft) long – around the same as a Boeing 737.





Found in all the world’s oceans, the blue whale travels thousands of miles every year, breeding in the tropics during the winter and swimming to more extreme latitudes to feed in summer. This also makes this species the Largest migrant in the animal kingdom.

Perhaps surprisingly, this behemoth of the deep feeds mainly on some of the ocean’s smallest inhabitants: tiny crustaceans called krill that reach no longer than a few centimetres. It swallows them in great gulps of seawater before raising its tongue to its mouth, straining the briny liquid through baleen plates but retaining its prey. This unparalleled difference in size between predator and prey represents yet another natural record.

Intensive whaling in the early 20th century devastated the world’s blue whale populations. But thankfully, since being designated a protected species in 1966 its numbers have started to rise again. With our continuing support, blue whales will be around for future generations to marvel at for many years to come.





RECORD-BREAKING BLUE WHALE BIOLOGY

1: Each upper jaw features about 400 plates of bristle-like keratin called baleen, which traps the krill that the whale feeds on

2: Weighing in at 4 tonnes (8,800 lb), it is the Heaviest tongue of any animal

3: The brain is proportionately tiny. It tips the scales at around 6 kg (15 lb); for context, human brains weigh about 1.4 kg (3 lb)

4: That huge body demands a lot of oxygen, so little wonder that they also boast the Largest lungs, with a capacity of 5,000 litres (1,320 US gal)

5: The Largest heart of any living creature weighs in at around 680 kg (1,500 lb) – about the size of a VW Beetle car! It beats just four to eight times a minute – the Slowest heart rate for a mammal

6: The tail flukes are 7.6 m (25 ft) wide – nearly as long as a London double-decker bus

Nikita has started training sessions with me, though she is still a bit nervous and guarded. Part of her training is just getting used to our animal care team and desensitizing her to the new environment. All of the husbandry training that we do with our cats is completely voluntary. It is always up to the animal whether they choose to participate or not. If they do, they receive positive reinforcement in the form of a treat—typically a meatball or beef chunk.

The first training we did was with the target buoy; she has to touch her nose to the buoy in order to receive a reward. This lets me get a good look at her body and make sure she has no injuries that our veterinarians need to address.

When she is in estrus, she is super-friendly and the sweetest cat. But she is so interested in playing that she doesn’t want to train. Instead, she will take the beef chunk from me, toss it up in the air and roll around on her back.

Do Nikita and Pavel have favorite enrichment items?

Nikita likes smelly stuff—especially perfumes and spices!

She has three indoor enclosures, one of which has a hammock bed made of firehose. Whenever we spray the hammock with perfume, she will rub her whole body against it to get as much of the scent onto her fur as possible.

In the next enclosure, there is a large log that also serves as enrichment, which we spray with perfume or sprinkle with spices—her favorites being fennel, paprika and sage. On any given day, she will also receive large, heavy-duty boomer balls to stalk, pounce upon or roll around. But, by far, anything scented with perfume is her favorite.

Pavel’s favorite enrichment items are cardboard boxes and bags stuffed with hay shavings—anything he can destroy! The moat is one of Pavel’s preferred places to rest and play, so it stands to reason that toys that float are among his favorites. One such toy is a boomer ball that is tethered to the bench in the moat. He seems to really enjoy wrestling with that and literally making a splash! Another of his favorites is a giant corrugated tube, which he drags into and out of the water. It is a testament to how strong he is. Soaking wet, the tube weighs around 70 pounds!

When Pavel first when out on exhibit, it was 5 degrees below zero and he got into the water in the moat—twice! He stayed outside for two hours, and we watched him explore the whole time."~[]

Yuri, an 8-year-old, 435-pound Amur tiger, arrived in late January all the way from the Bronx Zoo, according to Denver Zoo officials.

The tiger was brought at the recommendation of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan, which aims to ensure the animal's survival and the health of their gene pool.

Zoo officials hope to pair Yuri with 8-year-old Nikita, “and, with any luck, make a very valuable contribution to his endangered species.”

Curators are now waiting for Yuri to adjust to her new home in order to introduce him to Nikita.

“The two tigers can already see each other from various points in the exhibit, and Nikita is showing signs that she's ready to meet her new mate,” said Assistant Curator of Carnivores Janee Zakoren. “You can hear them ‘talking’ to each other most afternoons. She is definitely excited by his presence.”

Zoo officials say that because Yuri hasn’t sired any cubs yet, his genetics are “particularly valuable to the zoo’s collective efforts to save the species and maintain a healthy, genetically-diverse population of Amur tigers.”

Amur Tigers are considered an endangered species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

The biggest threats to these tigers come from poaching, both for their fur and their other body parts, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine.

But in reality, these “scary creatures” have an extremely important role in our environment, managing insect populations and pollinating plants.

Just like bees, bats pollinate many plants and facilitate seed dispersal. Bats also eat bugs, thus reducing the amount of pesticides used by farmers (which also means less pesticides polluting the environment). In fact, scientists estimate bats in the U.S. have saved us somewhere between $3.7 and 54 billion in pest control services every year.

According to Iman Memarian the last remaining Asiatic lion was sighted about 80 years ago in Iran. He went on to explain that before and after the Islamic Revolution (1979) Iran made attempts to bring back Asiatic lion to Iran, but Indians did not cooperate.

Tehran Zoological Garden has put in efforts to bring back Asiatic lion to Iran for 6 years, he said, adding that, “we submitted our request to the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).”

“We also developed a lion pen which complied with EAZA's standards,” Memarian highlighted.

According to the National Geographic nearly all wild lions live in sub-Saharan Africa, but one small population of Asiatic lions exists in India's Gir Forest. Asiatic lions and African lions are subspecies of the same species.

European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) recommended that a male and a female lions will be brought to Iran, however, U.S sanctions against Iran has complicated the transfer.

And now after years of collective attempts on Wednesday morning Tehran Zoological Garden will celebrate the return of the Asiatic lion to the country, Memarian concluded.

Asiatic lions once prowled from the Middle East to India. Now, only a fraction of these magnificent animals survive in the wild. Its range is restricted to the Gir National Park and environs in the Indian state of Gujarat. The Gir Forest's dry teak woods were once a royal hunting ground. Today they are a reserve where these at-risk big cats are heavily protected.

On the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy. It was also known as ""Indian lion"" and ""Persian lion"".

Until the 19th century, it occurred in eastern Turkey, Iran, Mesopotamia, and from east of the Indus River to Bengal and Narmada River in Central India. Since the turn of the 20th century, it is restricted to the Gir Forest National Park and surrounding areas.

Historical records in Iran indicate that it ranged from the Khuzestan Plain to the Fars in steppe vegetation and pistachio-almond woodlands. It was widespread in the country, but in the 1870s, it was sighted only on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains, and in the forest regions south of Shiraz. Some of the country's last lions were sighted in 1941 between Shiraz and Jahrom in Fars province, and in 1942, a lion was spotted about 65 km northwest of Dezful. In 1944, the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of Karun River in Khuzestan province.

Conflicts with humans, wildfires, poaching, canine distemper virus, decreases in population sizes of native ungulates are of the threats to the lions.

With just two northern white rhinos remaining in the world, both of whom are female, scientists are racing against the clock to rescue the species from the brink of extinction. Decades of poaching and habitat loss have led to their dramatic decline. Hope for their survival now rests on scientists’ ability to develop innovative methods for repopulating the species.

Enter a flexible, snakelike robot that could make it easier for zoologists to perform artificial insemination and embryo transfer on rhinos. That’s the type of tool that San Diego Zoo Global researchers and UC San Diego roboticists have teamed up to create. They are currently seeking crowdfunding to help design and build the robot.

“It’s essentially a long, thin catheter that can be steered through a rhino’s cervix to deliver a specimen to the uterus,” said Michael Yip, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC San Diego.

A unique challenge

This may at first sound straightforward, but navigating a female rhino’s reproductive anatomy is incredibly complicated. “The rhino cervix is very large and tortuous,” said Barbara Durrant, who serves as Henshaw Endowed Director of Reproductive Sciences at San Diego Zoo Global. It has a series of twists and turns like switchbacks on a steep mountain road. This goes on for 8 to 12 inches. Add to that a fairly long vagina plus the uterine body leading up to the uterine horn, and that totals up to 27 inches worth of rhino anatomy to get through before depositing semen or an embryo.

To make their way through this labyrinth, Durrant’s team currently uses a stainless steel catheter, 5 millimeters in diameter, with a 45-degree bend at the end. They have to guide this through the rhino’s cervix by hand. “It’s difficult and requires a bit of manipulation to negotiate and twist this through gently, so it doesn’t damage the cervical tissue,” Durrant said.

This technique has worked so far for doing artificial insemination. It’s typically performed when a female rhino’s estrogen levels are high, which causes her cervical tissue to soften and open.

But it gets even trickier when researchers have to do an embryo transfer. This procedure is usually done later in the rhino’s cycle when her progesterone levels are high. That causes her cervix to stiffen and close. “So, we can’t use anything that’s rigid,” Durrant said.

The solution that Durrant and her team were looking for happened to be just 30 miles away. At UC San Diego, Yip and his Advanced Robotics and Controls Lab were already at work building flexible robotic catheters. These are two to three-millimeter-diameter robots, measuring a couple meters in length, that can be shaped and maneuvered through complex spaces deep in the body with high precision.

Quest to repopulate an endangered species

Because neither of the remaining northern white rhino females are able to carry a pregnancy, Durrant’s team will use the robotic catheter on a related subspecies, the southern white rhino. The plan is to first create northern white rhino eggs and sperm using stem cells from previously collected frozen cell lines, then fertilize them to generate northern white rhino embryos. Researchers would then use the robot to implant the resulting embryos in surrogates.

“The ultimate goal is to produce a self-sustaining herd of northern white rhinos, first in captivity and then back into the wild,” Durrant said. “That’s still many, many years down the line, but we have excellent collaborators both here and around the world that are working with us and helping us move steadily in that direction.”

Yip’s original plan was to develop the flexible robotic catheters for human use in procedures like colonoscopies. But when Durrant learned of Yip’s technology, she saw a perfect opportunity for collaboration and reached out. Yip invited her to visit his lab, and after seeing how useful the robots could be for the zoo’s work, a partnership was born.

“As we were talking, we started realizing some of the surgical robotics that we were developing for humans could potentially be translated to the conservation of endangered animals,” Yip said. “And with the San Diego Zoo essentially in our backyard, this presented a great opportunity to work closely together.”

Yip’s robot can snake through extremely complicated canals, like the rhino’s cervix, more easily and gently than conventional tools. To flex back and forth, it uses a series of tendons running along its length. Pulling on a tendon on the left side of the device would make it turn left. Pulling on a tendon on another side would make it turn another direction.

“You can basically marionette the device to curve into any shape you want,” Yip said. “And you can control it to make very fine, delicate movements so that procedures could be done in the animal safely and non-traumatically.”

The robot will be equipped with a small camera head at the tip to help an operator see where it’s going. It will also have a channel for delivering its cargo — semen or an embryo — to the uterus.

“At the end of the day, I hope that technologies like this can be used to both repopulate critically endangered species and counter some of the unfortunate human poaching that has been going on around the world,” Yip said."~[]

Species reintroduction is the deliberate release of a species into the wild, from captivity or other areas where the organism is capable of survival. The goal of species reintroduction is to establish a healthy, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population to an area where it has been extirpated, or to augment an existing population.

Species that may be eligible for reintroduction are typically threatened or endangered in the wild. Because reintroduction may involve returning native species to localities where they had been extirpated, some prefer the term ""reestablishment"".

Disappeared for 80 years, Persian lion once prowled from the Middle East to India, while currently only a fraction of these magnificent animals survive in the wild, which range is restricted to the Gir National Park and environs in the Indian state of Gujarat.

A male Persian lion, born 6 years ago, was sent to Tehran Zoological Garden from Britain’s Bristol Zoo on May 1, under a population management program aiming at endangered species reproduction by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).

Iran will soon host a female lion of the same subspecies from Ireland to accompany the recently returned male lion through the conservation program.

And now speculation are running rampant, as some are starting to predict that the animal will be reintroduced into the Iran’s wild once again after long decades of extinction

On the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, Asiatic lion is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy.

Conflicts with humans, wildfires, poaching, habitat loss, canine distemper virus, decreases in population sizes of native ungulates were among the threats pushed the lions toward extinction in Iran, while lack of protection measures and plans is not deniable either.

“DOE welcomes Asiatic lion’s return to the country after decades of disappearance, however, we have only permitted the return of the animal to the zoo and will monitor its condition and have no plans for its reintroduction for the moment,” IRNA news agency quoted Kharrazian-Moqaddam as saying on Wednesday.

Currently the only purpose of the return of the animal is keeping it at the zoo, he highlighted.

DOE’s priority is to protect the species which are already existing in the country [and not reintroduction of the extinct ones], he stated.

The DOE official went on to say that in order to reintroduce a species into the wild it is essential to restore its former habitats meaning minimizing human conflicts, increasing prey population, and in general omitting current threats to the animals.

Maybe in the future we decide to plan a reintroduction scheme for Asiatic lion in the country, however, making the necessary arrangement may take years, he concluded.

Historical records in Iran indicate that the Asiatic lion ranged from the Khuzestan Plain to the Fars in steppe vegetation and pistachio-almond woodlands. It was widespread in the country, but in the 1870s, it was sighted only on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains, and in the forest regions south of Shiraz.

northern woodland magazine sponsored wellborn ecology fund new hampshire charitable foundation~"There is a broad, craggy precipice in Franconia Notch, NH, not far from my home, called Eagle Cliff. It was named in the 1800s for the golden eagles that nested there, back when the region was full of open farmland that was conducive to the giant raptors’ lifestyle. While the fields have grown up and the eagles are long gone, the cliff has been home to nesting peregrine falcons each year since 1981.

Once completely absent from the eastern United States, peregrine falcons have been making a steady comeback since the 1980s. Those falcons that nested on Eagle Cliff in 1981 marked the first successful re-occupancy of a historic cliff breeding site. Since then, recolonization has been steady, if slow.

“The population hasn’t been growing very rapidly,” said Chris Martin, a senior biologist with New Hampshire Audubon and director of that agency’s Peregrine Falcon Monitoring and Management Program. “Peregrines are just inching up. If we find a new nest site in a year, that’s a good year.”

There have been lots of good years since that first pair of falcons fledged two chicks in 1981. Last year, for example, New Hampshire Audubon staff – in collaboration with the state’s Fish & Game Department – documented 17 nesting pairs of peregrine falcons and 43 chicks. The numbers are rising similarly in Vermont, where a single pair of peregrine falcons fledged two chicks in 1986; by 2017, there were 44 documented nesting pairs raising 63 chicks. In New York peregrine nest on two bridges in New York City in 1983 have become more than 50 nesting pairs statewide.

Although removed from the federal Endangered Species List in 1999, peregrine falcons are still categorized as endangered in Maine and New York and as threatened in New Hampshire.

Vermont has upgraded peregrines to recovered status.

These crow-sized raptors are best known for their speed. In regular flight, a peregrine falcon can accelerate from around 25 miles per hour to close to 70 miles per hour while pursuing prey. They can go even faster when performing a dive-bombing-style “stoop,” reaching speeds upwards of 200 miles per hour while zeroing in on a chickadee or woodpecker or small duck.

“They’ll pull their wings in and look like a torpedo or a bullet dropping through the air,” said Martin.

The small raptors are able to slightly dislocate the shoulder joints of their wings to obtain a more streamlined shape. A bony structure at the opening of each nostril deflects air when the falcon is in a stoop so its lungs don’t overfill. Peregrine falcons also have incredible eyesight, allowing them to track prey at long distances.

All of this allows falcons to surprise and kill their prey efficiently. Peregrine falcons can chase and catch other birds, but they often strike their quarry with a killing blow in mid-air. The adults teach chicks to hunt by dropping food for the young birds to practice catching. Peregrine chicks will also snag dragonflies – a slightly easier target than songbirds – while learning to hunt.

These skillful flyers were decimated in the mid-twentieth century, in large part due to widespread use of the insecticide DDT. The chemical caused their eggs – and the eggs of other top-of-the-foodchain raptors – to become thin-shelled, which meant they either broke during incubation or failed to hatch.

The chemical was banned in 1972. In cooperation with other agencies, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service started peregrine recovery efforts in the late 1970s, when chicks were hatched in captivity and released into the wild.

As peregrine falcons have gradually recovered in the Northeast, participating agencies have worked to protect natural nesting sites and enhance new sites on manmade structures. Peregrine falcons typically choose sites on high cliffs, and a pair will return each year to the same area, building a small scrape for laying eggs – or using a repurposed raven’s nest. But biologists have also encouraged nesting on manmade structures – tall buildings, smoke stacks, and bridges – by adding nesting boxes when peregrines are known to be in the area. One such site is the 259-foot tall Brady Sullivan building in Manchester, New Hampshire, where New Hampshire Audubon has set up a peregrine web cam and where falcons have been nesting since 2001.

Still, Martin said about 80 percent of the peregrine falcons in New Hampshire nest on cliff faces, including many locations around the White Mountains and along the Connecticut River. “One of the things that’s unique about northern New England’s peregrines is the vast majority of our birds are still nesting in ancestral, natural habitats,” said Martin. “They’re using the same places they used 100 years ago. These birds are back where they were – plus some other places, too.”

Introducing Jim Knox, our newest columnist

Measuring up to twelve feet from nose to tail, standing five feet tall on all fours, tipping the scales at up to seven hundred pounds and boasting three-inch long canines, Amur Tigers are as humbling as they are magnificent. I’m grateful to have a firsthand perspective on these apex predators. I have prepared their meals, fed them, cleaned their quarters, observed their behaviors, and assisted veterinary teams with their handling and surgical procedures, including root canals—yes, even tigers get cavities!

Possessing the advantage—the privilege—of providing care for tigers, has given me a fathomless reverence for these primal creatures. It has given voice, texture, and force to their extraordinary adaptations. Their two-inch arched claws shred oak and maple logs. Their dense outer fur shields them from prolonged sub-zero temperatures. Their crowned carnassial teeth easily shear through lamb shanks—bone and all!

The tiger is a creature of contradiction. It is designed to kill large prey almost instantly with unstoppable force. Amur tigers are masterful predators and superbly designed killers, capable of dealing a swift death to any creature within their domain. This is an apex predator with few equals, and yet… it is a failure.

With a kill rate hovering at a meager five percent, tigers survive not solely because of their incredible physical adaptations, but also their enviable behavioral adaptations. Through my work, I’ve come to realize that the tiger in, its entirety, is a creature greater than just its scientific self. It’s greatness extends far beyond its jaws and claws.

Their physical adaptations provide a platform for success in stalking and killing their prey such as Red Deer and Wild Boar, it is the behavioral “inner tiger” which wields the true power. In a word, it is the tiger’s tenacity that gets the job done. Stoked by hunger and fueled by failure, this tenacity pushes the tiger to its absolute physical limits to persevere, hunt after failed hunt, until it scores a life-saving kill.

The tiger requires large hoofed prey, up to one hundred pounds of meat, to refuel and repair a body ravaged by the rigors of the hunt at forty below zero. Between these large successes, the great cats subsist on hares, birds, rodents and carrion to keep them going as a bridge between their large meals.

In the human world, not every achievement is monumental, but the path to every monumental achievement is marked by more modest achievements, which enable us to reach our goals.

Expanding one’s own territory or establishing an entirely new home range is a bold move, yet tigers perch with seeming ease atop this knife edge of risk and reward. Dismissing the human element of poaching, tigers must still contend with, among harsh and potentially fatal factors, other tigers. Like house cats and dogs, tigers scent mark territorial boundaries to maintain dominion over the food, water, space and shelter resources within their home range.

They will spray hormone-laced blasts of urine to mark any prominent vertical natural landmark such a boulder, tree or rock face. This is a tiger’s equivalent of an olfactory neon flashing sign which reads: “Keep Out! Enter at Your Own Risk!”

With each cat possessing the strength of 17 full-grown humans, they mean it. Trespassing encroachment on guarded territory and resources can be met with lethal force. If the victor is hungry, the loser may be eaten.

The Amur tiger possesses certain undeniable strengths, and so do we. Specifically, the Amur tiger is equipped with phenomenal raw physical power—the kind of power which enables it to square off against full-grown Eurasian Brown bears. The tiger, capable of covering 50 feet per second, is an explosive ambush predator, which takes the majority of its prey within the first 150 feet of its attack. Its main prey, Red Deer and Wild Boar, are equally fast and can sustain their speed far longer than 150 feet. Such quarry are no pushovers. The Eurasian Wild Boar is a fearsome creature. With a low center of gravity mounted on a seven foot-long, five hundred and fifty-pound frame, it is nature’s bulldozer. Reaching 0-30 mile per hour acceleration in under 1.5 seconds, this bulldozer runs on nitrous oxide. Throw in exceptional hearing, paired five-inch, self-sharpening razor tusks and arguably the planet’s most refined sense of smell, and you’ve got one formidable adversary.

The tiger has its work cut out for it. It must stealthily stalk or secret itself within striking distance to put its strength into play. It has to put itself into a position to unleash its strength or the hunt is over before it begins. We can do the same, giving ourselves the opportunity to wield the advantages we possess.

By concentrating its strengths well and employing them in concert, the tiger gains an incremental advantage, which is sorely needed if the cat is to survive and prevail against capable prey. A tiger gains knowledge from the harsh lessons failure instills. A missed leap or a goring at the business end of a Wild Boar provide powerful incentives to incorporate alternate tactics.

Another core strength the tiger harnesses in its pursuit of success is focus. I’m not talking mere concentration here. I’m talking about intense, unwavering focus—the kind of focus which excludes all non-essential factors. The tiger is single-minded in pursuit of its quarry. While failure is no stranger to this predator, it endures. With every stealthy placement of its leathery foot pads, the Amur tiger is relentlessly hunting success every bit as much as it is hunting Red Deer and Wild Boar.

The great cat prepares for the moment it puts its skills to the test. Readying every sense, it targets its prey, locking its gaze and fixating on its objective. Time becomes suspended and then, it happens. In an instant, all of its energy—every sense, strength and skill coalesce in a potent, fluid burst of energy which launches the tiger to victory.

We all face challenges to achievement and the stakes get higher: passing the Bar exam, landing your first job, publishing your manuscript… the list goes on. By applying behavioral biomimicry—emulating animals as models of success, we can achieve remarkable things. Each one of us has at least one Wild Boar in our sights. With the right game plan we can bring down this daunting quarry. We need look no further than our friend the Amur Tiger to coax it out. To the tiger, failure is not defining. Nurturing the tenacity to succeed five percent of the time after having failed ninety five percent of the time…now that’s defining!

The zoo's male African lion, M'bari, had been suffering from a degenerative kidney, large kidney cyst, and spinal arthritis and under veterinary care before the decision was made to put him down, according to park spokesperson Andrew Jones.

At 15-years-old, M'bari had exceeded expectations of a lion's average lifespan, which is about 10 years in the wild and can exceed 25 years in captivity, according to the zoo.

""In recent days, his condition had steadily worsened, despite attempts by animal care staff to modify his habitat to make him more comfortable,"" a statement from the zoo read. ""This morning, because of his worsening quality of life, animal care staff made the difficult decision to humanely euthanize him.""

M'bari was introduced to locals at the San Diego Wild Animal Park in 2004 with the opening of Lion Camp when he was about two years old. He eventually moved to the San Diego Zoo in 2009, and has most recently lived with his mate, Etosha, in the Harry and Grace Steele Elephant Odyssey habitat.

Perhaps the most vocal of the pride, visitors were routinely treated to M'bari's mighty roar when visiting the park.

""His early morning and late afternoon roars could be heard throughout the entire Zoo,"" officials said.

Kesi was born May 10 and made her public debut Friday, according to a Denver Zoo news release. Kesi is her parent’s first baby and an important addition to a species that is listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Mandrills are a primate native to the rainforests in central West Africa. They have bright blue and red faces and can store almost an entire stomach’s worth of food in their cheek pouches. The species is the largest of all monkeys. The most well-known mandrill is the character Rafiki in “The Lion King.”

Two decades ago, the Denver Zoo experienced a “mandrill baby boom,” according to the zoo. Then, the zoo’s primates stopped procreating.

Kesi’s mother, Kumani, arrived at the zoo last year as part of a plan by U.S. zoos to help threatened species survive. Kumani became pregnant at the end of 2018.

For the best chance to catch Kesi and the rest of the troop, visitors should come to the zoo in the early morning or around lunchtime, according a zoo news release about the birth."~[]

The female lion, born 4 years ago, now is coming back to its motherland after being extinct for 8 decades, YJC quoted Iman Memarian as saying on Saturday.

The 6-year old male lion was sent to Tehran Zoological Garden from Britain’s Bristol Zoo on May 1, he said.

He went on to say that the lion has undergone genetic tests and diagnostics under the EAZA supervision, and the results have showed that the animal is completely healthy.

Both will be kept at Tehran Zoological Garden separately for a period, and then will live together, Memarian concluded.

On the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy. It was also known as ""Indian lion"" and ""Persian lion"".

Historical records in Iran indicate that it ranged from the Khuzestan Plain to the Fars in steppe vegetation and pistachio-almond woodlands. It was widespread in the country, but in the 1870s, it was sighted only on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains, and in the forest regions south of Shiraz. Some of the country's last lions were sighted in 1941 between Shiraz and Jahrom in Fars province, and in 1942, a lion was spotted about 65 km northwest of Dezful. In 1944, the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of Karun River in Khuzestan province.

Conflicts with humans, wildfires, poaching, canine distemper virus, decreases in population sizes of native ungulates are of the threats to the lions.

""No Man's Land"" features the last two remaining northern white rhinos and their carers

The series is part of a greater project on people who dedicate their lives to helping animals

Photographer Justin Mott remembers how he felt the first time he entered the northern white rhino reserve, where the last two rhinos of the species live.

“It just hit me that I was getting back into doing the work that I’m passionate about — work that has meaning to my soul.” For Mott, the experience of photographing the last of an entire species was revelatory.

In his newest photo series, “No Man’s Land,” Mott captures the last two surviving northern white rhinos, Fatu and Najin — both female — and those working on the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya where the rhinos live.

In one particularly poignant photo, one of the primary rhino caretakers Peter Esegon, 47, reaches down to touch Najin's forehead, showing the strong connection between these animals and their keepers. This photo and more are now on display at the Anastasia Photo gallery in New York City's Lower East Side neighborhood.

The series is the first of a greater project, “Kindred Guardians,” which features people who devote their lives to helping animals. In “No Man’s Land,” Mott showcases those responsible for overseeing the remaining days of an entire species. Mott intended for the photo project to be as much about humans as it is about the animals they serve.

“I want people to celebrate the tenderness, bravery and dedication of the caretakers,"" Mott said.

The series stands as a sort of redemption for Mott, who previously shied away from covering animal cruelty stories after visiting a slaughterhouse in Vietnam.

Mott explains, “I knew I had to get back to doing stories that mattered to me and I was slowly starting to open myself up emotionally to learning about animal cruelty…I’m an impulsive person and I had heard about the last two remaining northern white rhinos so I did a little bit of research, secured access and booked my tickets to Kenya to start this project.”

Due to rampant poaching, three out of the five rhino species are critically endangered. The remaining two species are marked as vulnerable by the WWF.

The death of the last northern white rhino male, Sudan, in March of 2018 signaled the end of the subspecies. Many attempts were made to mate Sudan, but all were unsuccessful. A lack of funds to develop the necessary in vitro fertilization technology dashed all hopes for the future of the northern white rhino.

Mott has had his own run-ins with rhino poaching during his time working on an editorial assignment as an undercover buyer. Comparing the experience of holding a severed rhino tusk to touching the horn of Najin was an impactful moment for him. “I was sad and happy at the same time — sad about their plight but happy to see a rhino in person and feel it alive.”

Mott hopes to conjure similarly strong emotions from his viewers. Ultimately, Mott wants people to find sympathy for another species, one that has been pushed to extinction by humans.

“I wish my images can humanize them [the rhinos] in a way that we can all relate to and encourage people to act, speak out and change their ways and actions towards animals.”"~[]

The Dallas Zoo is bringing back three endangered African painted dogs, a species the zoo hasn’t had since 1962.

African painted dogs are one of the most social mammals on earth, with the most structured, organized hierarchy of any carnivorous species, the Dallas Zoo said in a news release.

“African painted dogs are an incredibly intelligent, fascinating species and we know our guests are going to fall in love with these pack animals,” said Harrison Edell, Dallas Zoo’s Executive Vice President of Animal Care and Conservation. “As Africa’s most successful hunters, they’re also very nurturing – they work together for the welfare of the whole pack and care for the young and the ill, so no member is left behind.”

The Dallas Zoo will care for one 8-year-old female named Ola, and two 2-year-old brothers, Jata and Mzingo, making them the only African painted dogs in North Texas.

Guests can meet the trio starting Monday, June 17. They can be found in the former cheetah habitat next to the lions in the Giants of the Savanna. (The cheetahs have moved to the mandrill habitat, which is better suited for them as geriatric animals. The mandrills are now living at Primate Place in a habitat that is specially designed for monkeys.)

Ola hails from the Brookfield Zoo and was the first dog to enter the habitat today (June 12) in the Giants of the Savanna. The two males are coming from The Wilds, a private, nonprofit safari park managed by the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, and will join Ola later this week.

“This is one of the most delicate introductions we’ve ever done because African painted dogs have such an intricate social network. We have to ensure there is little disruption to their hierarchy,” said Keith Zdrojewski, Dallas Zoo’s Curator of Carnivores and Primates. “Ola will naturally assume the alpha female role, and one of the brothers will need to step up to the alpha male role. We’re excited to watch this pack grow and bond together – they’re going to be amazing ambassadors for their endangered species.”

African painted dogs are known for their large, round ears, and mottled pattern of black, yellow, brown, and white fur that helps make the pack look larger, which confuses prey and predators. Their scientific name, Lycaon pictus, means “painted wolf,” but they are not a wolf or a dog – they are a unique species that is the only member of their genus. They live and hunt in packs and have tremendous endurance and stamina to pursue their prey for miles without tiring. Operating as a single unit, they are the most efficient predators in Africa, being successful about 80 percent of the time.

African painted dogs are one of the most endangered carnivores, with fewer than 6,000 dogs remaining in parts of southern and eastern Africa. Their numbers continue to decline due to habitat loss, shooting by ranchers to protect their livestock, disease, and more. There are currently 136 individuals living in U.S. zoos accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums."~[]

""Carli"" is a 6-week-old Siberian tiger cub and only the second cub to be born in Great Adventure's facility. She's named after New Jersey native and soccer star Carli Lloyd, a player on U.S. Women's National Team.

Carli is being raised by Great Adventure's animal care team by hand until she can be reintroduced to her mother, Nadya.

“Nadya showed great mothering skills at first; but when she failed to nurse her cub, we stepped in,” Safari veterinarian Dr. Ken Keiffer said in a statement. “Today, Carli is doing extremely well. She weighs 12 pounds and when full grown, will weigh more than 500 lbs. Her large paws are indicative of the massive cat she will grow to become one day.”

Guests will be able to see Carli in Safari Discoveries soon, the amusement park announced.

Carli's mother, Nadya, was raised in a litter with an African lion three years ago at Great Adventure. The animal care team said it hopes the three cats can be bonded into a trio.

“Tigers are typically solitary animals, while lions are more social,"" Keiffer said. ""The strong bond that Carli’s mom Nadya shares with lion Zuri will hopefully mean that the trio will become their own pride one day.""

Disappeared for 80 years, Persian lion once prowled from the Middle East to India, while currently only a fraction of these magnificent animals survive in the wild, which range is restricted to the Gir National Park and environs in the Indian state of Gujarat.

A male Persian lion, born 6 years ago, was sent to Tehran Zoological Garden from Britain’s Bristol Zoo on May 1, under a population management program aiming at endangered species reproduction by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).

Iran recently hosted a female lion of the same subspecies from Ireland to accompany the male lion through the conservation program.

The female lion now is being kept in the zoo and so far has met her male companion, Fars news agency quoted Iman Memarian as saying on Monday.

“We are trying to get the couple to get to know each other gradually until they get used to living together,” he further noted.

He went on to say that we have plans to reproduce endangered species and save them from extinction, and all the process is under control.

Considering that Persian lion is a symbol in Iran’s wildlife, many environment lovers were interested to see such valuable species but it disappeared due to uncontrolled hunting and lack of prey, he lamented, adding, therefore, we tried to show how important it is to preserve the wildlife by returning the lions back to their motherland.

During the past years, Tehran Zoological Garden has succeeded in becoming a member of EAZA, and the Asiatic lions have been transferred to the Zoo for captive breeding under the association’s supervision, he highlighted.

Two male lion siblings of the same subspecies were inhabiting in Houston city in Texas, United states, he stated, adding, one of them lost his life due to the physical problems, thus, the lion returned to Iran from Britain is the most valuable and healthy one.

Selling or buying animals in European zoos is banned, and the female lion was given to Iran because of our compliance with the EAZA standards, Memarian also highlighted.

Referring to the cost of keeping wild species, he said that lions feed on 10 to 15 kilograms of lamb and poultry daily, which are so expensive.

Criticizing the approaches claiming that zoos endanger wildlife species for their own interests, he said that some think that when an animal is in the cage, it is not feeling well at the moment, however, one should bear in mind that animals have different needs, all of which can be provided at standard zoos.

Previously, we needed to withdraw a blood sample from animals which caused them stress, but now we can test them through their feces and urine, he further stated.

Also, it is possible to measure the amount of hormones in the body through the urine and feces of animals, so researches show that the level of wildlife satisfaction in standard zoos is even higher than their level of satisfaction in nature, he added.

Lion is among the flagship species which is attractive to people, and because of them, smaller animals are known, so, we do our best to conserve the species in the country, Memarian concluded.

In conservation biology, a flagship species is chosen to stimulate people to provide money or support for biodiversity conservation in a given place or social context. The use of flagship species has been dominated by large bodied animals, especially mammals, like Asiatic cheetah.

Threats pushed Persian lions toward extinction

On the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List, Asiatic lion is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy.

Historical records in Iran indicate that the Asiatic lion ranged from the Khuzestan Plain to the Fars in steppe vegetation and pistachio-almond woodlands. It was widespread in the country, but in the 1870s, it was sighted only on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains, and in the forest regions south of Shiraz.

Some of the country's last lions were sighted in 1941 between Shiraz and Jahrom in Fars province, and in 1942, a lion was spotted about 65 km northwest of Dezful. In 1944, the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of Karun River in Khuzestan province.

Conflicts with humans, wildfires, poaching, habitat loss, canine distemper virus, decreases in population sizes of native ungulates were among the threats pushed the lions toward extinction in Iran, while lack of protection measures and plans is not deniable either.

On June 6, 2019 a baby panda was born at the Sacramento Zoo in California. While news of the cub's birth generated some media interest, chances are you didn't read about it in your local newspaper or see it on your news feed. In fact, it seems that people — reporters included — paid more attention to panda Mei Xiang at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington, D.C. when she didn't give birth in 2018.

Why the lack of attention for the Sacramento cub? The answer is simple: The baby was a red panda, not the giant panda so many people swoon over. Never mind that red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) are just as cute. And never mind red pandas are just as endangered. And never, never mind that humans are destroying the habitat of the red panda at an alarming rate. For some reason, there's simply not enough love for these awesome, cuddly looking creatures.

""People think red panda is [a] lesser form of giant panda because of its name,"" Saroj Shrestha, program coordinator for the Red Panda Network in Nepal says via e-mail. The two pandas are not even related, despite both being called pandas.

The Bear Essentials

Regardless, red pandas, which resemble a mix between a bear and a raccoon, are just as adorable as the giant panda. They look like they could have stepped out of a children's picture book, with faces that you want to kiss the fur off. Their eyes are mesmerizing and inquisitive. Some scientists call them the not-so-nice ""lesser panda."" Others call them the ""first panda,"" because they were discovered 50 years before the giant panda. Still others call them ""firefox."" Regardless of their moniker, red pandas are da bomb.

While giant pandas are black and white, the red panda is, well, you guessed it, red with an undercarriage of black, along with white ears and snout. The colors of their coat protect these balls of awesomeness from predators, allowing red pandas to blend into their surroundings. In fact, their red fur is the same hue as the moss on the trees where they spend most of their time.

Red pandas are mysterious creatures. They are rarely seen, but inhabit a ribbon of mountains and forests in Nepal, India, Bhutan, China and Myanmar. Their average length is between 22 and 25 inches (56 and 63 centimeters) and their tails can grow upward of 19 inches (47 centimeters). They use the long tail as a blanket, which covers them snugly as they sleep. The tail is also a stand-in for a downy pillow.

Red pandas conserve energy lounging in trees. They are solitary, seeking out companionship only when it is time to mate. Although red pandas are classified as meat eaters, they'll eat up to 20,000 bamboo leaves a day. Every once in a while they'll shake up their diet by eating raw eggs, an insect or a tiny animal that might scurry by.

Like the giant pandas, red pandas have an extra ""thumb,"" which they use to grab hold of bamboo stems and tree branches. Their claws are cat-like, sharp and hidden until they need to use them. The soles of their feet are like fuzzy slippers, which makes it easier for them to grip slippery surfaces.

Public Enemy No. 1: Humans

Unfortunately, there are only 10,000 red pandas in the wild. Humans are killing them at a rapid rate by destroying their habitat and poaching. Like nearly every other species on the planet, red pandas have to compete with the unquenchable human thirst for land, natural resources and money.

Specifically, humans plow under the panda's habitat to build roads, farms, hydro projects, and to make way for powerlines. Farmers cut down stands of bamboo for firewood, building materials, and to clear land on which livestock graze. Dogs, which herd livestock, chase down and kill the pandas, often spreading disease, including distemper.

""Habitat loss and fragmentation are the result of unsustainable harvesting of natural resources, land management and livestock herding practices, as well as of settlement and agricultural conversion,"" Shrestha says. ""Grazing pressure and the unsustainable harvest of forest resources have placed tremendous pressure on red pandas.""

Climate change is also decimating red panda's habitat and population. Bamboo leaves account for 98 percent of their diet.

""Many bamboo species are vulnerable to climate change because of their unusual extended reproduction intervals, ranging from 10 to 120 years,"" Shrestha says. ""The red panda's habitat is predicted to shift toward higher elevations, resulting in a decline of existing habitat. Loss of bamboo could result in habitat fragmentation, making most of the current habitat unsuitable in the future and decline in red panda population.""

Saving the Red Panda

Efforts are underway to protect this huggable mammal. Scientists, like Shrestha, are identifying ""red panda hotspots"" and ""biological corridors"" in an effort minimize habitat destruction. Deforested areas are slowly being replanted with native trees and bamboo. Advocacy groups, like the Red Panda Network, are giving herders collapsible tents and improved cooking stoves (ICS) so they don't have to slice bamboo trees for temporary shelter and firewood.

""We are also promoting and providing ICS for local households residing in red panda habitat,"" Shrestha says. The stoves have reduced firewood consumption by more than 50 percent, he says.

Moreover, Shrestha says, organizations are encouraging farmers to use ""stall feeding"" for their livestock ""to discourage open grazing inside red panda habitat."""~[]

The cub was born to Moonlight, who you can see snacking on apples and grapes in this video and who in 2017 gave birth to Starlight, who now lives in Rochester, New York. Let’s look at another picture of the new cub being weighed.

Red pandas are an endangered species, and this cub—keepers do not yet know its sex—will stay with Moonlight until it’s at least a year old. Red pandas are also frequent stars of local news coverage, thanks in great part to the efforts of Rusty, a red panda who captivated this town with a daring overnight escape in 2013. He later moved out to Front Royal. Rusty is still alive, zoo spokesperson Devon Murphy tells Washingtonian, though this cub is no relation—Rusty was not recommended to breed this year. Another red panda, Sunny, escaped from the Virginia Zoo in Norfolk in 2017 and has never been found; the animal has since passed into local legend.

Murphy says it’s too early to know where this cub may end up–we can always hope for another one of these magnificent animals in DC—but that two red pandas, Jackie and Asa, are currently at the zoo, and there’s nothing stopping you from seeing them now.

A blue whale and its calf were captured on drone video by photographer Domenic Biagini Wednesday about 12 miles off the coast of Mission Beach.

The beautiful sight isn't something many videographers have the chance to see, Biagini told 10News.

""This kind of footage of a blue whale calf pretty much doesn’t exist. It’s me and the Our Planet documentary people that have ever captured something like this. That’s about it,"" he said.

The large animals generally follow the path of krill in coastal waters, Biagini said. If there's an abundance of krill the whales will spend nearly the entire summer close by, making for some excellent whale-watching opportunities.

""Last few years they haven’t stayed past the end of July because our water gets so warm that it’s not conducive to krill production,"" Biagini said.

But even with the footage, we still know little about the mating and breeding habits of blue whales, Biagini added.

""We have an idea where some of the animals are going to give birth, but that’s only a select few, and still doesn’t include any concrete evidence,"" he said. ""There’s only a handful of people in the world to have filmed a baby blue with any kind of professional equipment. And an even smaller few to film something as intimate as I just did in what has to be some of the calmest conditions imaginable.""

In a long-term study, scientists at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) found male African lions living in human care hit puberty a full year earlier than their counterparts in the wild. The results were published today, July 3, in PLOS ONE. As the population of lions in the wild continues to shrink due to habitat loss, conflict with humans and disease, knowing exactly when male lions reach puberty and are capable of breeding is important for conserving the species.

“There is so little known about lion reproductive physiology, especially the males, so this study provides exciting new evidence on how wild and captive lions differ and how nutrition and other factors may affect them,” said Budhan Pukazhenthi, coauthor of the paper and biologist at SCBI.

Researchers studied 21 male lions from 17 zoos and monitored their fecal and urinary testosterone metabolites along with their body weights. In the wild, male lions start experiencing a rise in testosterone at approximately 2 years old, which signals that the male is becoming sexually mature and it is time for him to leave the pride and search for mates. Male zoo lions start producing the hormone around 1 year old, a full year before wild males. Researchers confirmed that the males had reached puberty by looking for sperm in the urine, which was also present starting around 1 year old. Despite reaching puberty earlier, many zoo-born male lions live with the pride they were born into until they are approximately 3 years old. The research shows that zoos should consider separating male lions from their birth prides at an earlier age and pair them with unrelated females to establish their own prides.

“This research could have a significant impact on how lions are managed in human care,” said Craig Saffoe, coauthor of the paper and curator of Great Cats at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo. “Having this level of insight into the onset of puberty may enable husbandry managers to more effectively decide on the appropriate timing of introducing animals. This could lead to lions breeding at an earlier age and increasing the number of potentially successful breeding opportunities for individual animals—especially females.”

The authors speculate that one reason why male lions living in zoos are hitting puberty earlier is because they are growing and gaining weight faster. Wild cubs often go through long periods without food, especially after they are weaned and must transition to eating meat. However, young males are still dependent on the adults in the pride to hunt and bring them food. Those long periods without food can slow the pace they grow and is one of the most perilous times for a cub. By contrast, lion cubs born in zoos have a constant supply of nutritious food and are not dependent on their parents to hunt for it. They gain on average 7.3 kilos per month until they are 2 years old, whereas wild cubs in Kruger National Park in South Africa gain only about 3.9 kilos per month until they are about 2 years old.

There are about 20,000 lions living in Africa and their numbers have declined by 30% in the past decade. Their habitats are increasingly fragmented and isolated, putting the species at risk of becoming inbred in the wild and susceptible to disease. There are 750 lions living in zoos around the world and breeding those lions to create a genetically healthy population in human care is increasingly important for the survival of the species as a whole.

“This information will help the African Lion Species Survival Plan build a healthy population of lions living in zoos so the species will never go extinct,” said Janine Brown, coauthor of the paper and endocrinologist at SCBI.

Additional authors on the paper include Sarah Putman at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and Ashley Franklin at the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute plays a leading role in the Smithsonian’s global efforts to save wildlife species from extinction and train future generations of conservationists. SCBI spearheads research programs at its headquarters in Front Royal, Virginia, the Smithsonian’s National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and at field research stations and training sites worldwide. SCBI scientists tackle some of today’s most complex conservation challenges by applying and sharing what they learn about animal behavior and reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration and conservation sustainability."~[]

Dating back to the days of woolly mammoths, humans have been obsessed with larger-than-life mammals. And on the aquatic front, there's no bigger mammal than the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), which is the largest known animal to ever grace the planet.

So Exactly How Big Are Blue Whales?

Adam Ratner, a marine scientist with the The Marine Mammal Center, confirms that ""blue whales are the largest animal on the planet and the largest animal identified that has been on this Earth."" No evidence has been found that any other creature — even the largest of dinosaurs — surpassed the blue whale in size. But wait! What about the Megalodon, an extinct shark species believed to be the largest fish on planet Earth (and which you may recall from the 2018 horror movie The Meg)? Well, scientists guess that even the biggest Megalodon only reached a mere 58 feet (18 meters) (though some argue it was up to 82 feet [25 meters]). By contrast, the largest blue whales clock in at a little more than 100 feet (30 meters) long, and on average are between 75-90 feet (23-27 meters) in length. The largest blue whales live in the Southern Ocean near Antarctica.

Care to take a guess at this hefty creature's weight? 5 tons? Nope. 50? 100? Getting closer, but not quite. The blue whale weighs approximately 400,000 pounds (181,437 kilograms), or 200 tons.

Ratner shares some other startling facts about the blue whale's mass.

A blue whale's tongue alone weighs as much as an elephant. About 100 people can fit in a blue whale's mouth.

A blue whale's heart is the size of a car, its eye is the size of a basketball, and a small child could swim through its arteries.

The spray from a blue whale's blowhole is almost as tall as a three-story building (30 feet, or 9 meters, high).

All these statistics are daunting, but what do blue whales really look like? They are blue-gray in color — hence the name, though they also goes by ""sulfur-bottom whale"" due to their yellowish underbelly — with lighter gray patches that resemble splotches of paint. The blue whale is part of the baleen whale family — a group of toothless whales — and so its mouth ""contains up to 800 plates of short, wide, black baleen or 'whalebone,' with thick, coarse bristles used for catching food."" Perhaps surprisingly, female blue whales are usually larger than the males.

What Do Blue Whales Eat?

Because of their enormous size, you'd be forgiven for thinking that blue whales must chow down on some pretty big prey, but that's actually not the case. Despite their massive girth, blue whales rely on very tiny, two-inch crustaceans known as krill as their staple meal. And boy, do blue whales eat a lot of krill.

Ratner shares that ""given their size, blue whales rely on vast quantities of food. Using plates of baleen to filter small zooplankton from the water, they can consume up to six tons, or 12,000 pounds (5,443 kilograms) of krill each day."" He continues, ""In one gulp, the blue whale can take in 125 percent of its body weight of water and krill (250 tons). That is half a million calories!""

Blue Whale Behavior and Communication

Despite all the hubbub over their hefty size, not much is known about blue whales' behavior in group settings, though they are not believed to be aggressive. ""Very little is known about blue whale social structures. We do tend to see blue whales traveling alone or in small groups,"" says Ratner. ""In terms of behavior in the wild, they don't tend to be very belligerent to each other or other animals, but rather focused on feeding or migrating, but again, behavior during breeding season could be very different and is still in need of more research."" But marine biologists are studying one way that blue whales communicate with each other: sound.

""Blue whales produce one of the loudest sounds in the animal kingdom, a low rumble that can be heard hundreds of miles, and even reported to be thousands of miles away in the ocean,"" says Ratner. ""Researchers are still unsure of the meaning of the vocalizations though, with best guesses being around finding mates or signaling opportunities for mating or feeding.""

Jeff Jacobsen, a marine biologist with the Noyo Center for Marine Science, expands on the sounds of blue whales, which scientists use to estimate whale population size, among other factors. When these whale calls are repeated in a sequence, they become known as songs. Only male blue whales sing, however. ""These songs differ by ocean basin, region. Their low frequency calls can be detected at very great distances, depending on ocean conditions,"" says Jacobsen in an email.

The frequency of their songs is affected by noisy conditions caused by objects like passing ships. Blue whales adjust the frequency of songs ""by blowing air through their vocal cords at a faster or slower rate,"" according to a study which was conducted by a group of researchers at Oregon State University and published in August, 2017, after they observed a gradual decline in the frequency of blue whale calls. Scientists are still trying to figure out the meaning of these songs. Though since only males sing, these songs could be a factor in mating and courtship rituals.

If you're curious, you can listen to the sound of blue whales at Blue Whale Vocalization.

Blue Whale Mating and Offspring

According to Ratner, female blue whales give birth to a single baby calf every two to three years, following an 11-month pregnancy or gestation period. These blue whale babes typically are a whopping 25-feet-long (around 8-meters-long) and weigh 7,000 pounds (3,175 kilograms), which is heavier than a mid-size SUV. ""The milk from their mothers is so nutritious that the calves gain 200 pounds (90 kilograms) a day nursing,"" says Ratner.

Little is known about how blue whales mate, however. ""Mating behavior is still being studied, though so far it seems that males defend females from other males. We see impressive surface behaviors during the fall of two males 'fighting' for a female,"" says Jacobsen.

John Calambokidis, a co-founder of the nonprofit Cascadia Research and research biologist who has conducted extensive studies on the movement of blue whales, expands on the whales' possible mating habits, including how they communicate and socialize with each other: ""One feature of blue whales is the extremely loud calls they make, and we have recently discovered these very loud calls are produced only by males, indicating it plays some role in mating or competition with other males."" He notes that blue whales will also form male-female pairs during mating season — notably, with the female leading the pair. Competition for mates can also get a little intense, apparently. ""There is also a competition involving high speed swimming that occurs when more than one male is involved,"" says Calambokidis.

How Many Are There and Are They Endangered?

A blue whale's average lifespan is 80-90 years. However, their existence is increasingly under threat. Blue whales are currently listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. As commercial whale hunting took off in the early 1900s, blue whales dropped from a pre-whaling population of 250,000 to an estimated 10,000-25,000 individuals alive presently, according to Ratner.

Calambokidis, says that ""the [blue whale] population is still under 5 percent of what it was prior to whaling, with most of this decrease from the Southern Hemisphere where blue whales were most numerous.""

Jacobsen agrees, and says that, ""for some reason blue whales were not as impacted by whaling along the [California] coast and we have at least 2,000 individuals here. The population is still recovering around Antarctica."" Jacobsen describes how whales still remain highly vulnerable to collisions with ships, which is how the Noyo blue whale — whose skeleton is being restored at the Noyo Center — was killed. ""For example, it seems that when there are more krill in the shipping lanes, more whales get hit,"" says Jacobsen, citing an article by Oregon State University's Whale Telemetry Group.

Other challenges facing the blue whale include entrapment in fishing gear and climate change affecting the mammal's food sources. But there are some organizations working to make habitats safer for blue whales. Ratner says that the Marine Mammal Center has addressed policies about changing shipping lanes in the San Francisco Bay in order to reduce the likelihood of boats impacting migrating whales. He also suggests that ""individuals around the world can make a huge difference by examining their carbon footprint, and working within their communities (neighborhoods, schools, work) to reduce their use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas for energy and transportation, as well as reducing their use of single-use plastics, one of the most commonly found items of ocean trash that can pose a threat of entanglement or ingestion for large whales.""

Migratory Habits

Like many marine mammals, blue whales migrate as the seasons change, but you can find them all over the globe. Ratner says that ""Blue whales are found in all oceans, minus the Arctic, and can be found both on coastal shelves and deep, oceanic waters."" The whales typically migrate toward the North and South poles, traversing ""into colder waters in the summer to feed, while migrating back towards the equator into warmer waters in the winter to [breed],"" says Ratner. But Calambokidis adds that blue whales' migration patterns are slightly more flexible than other baleen whales, like the gray whale. This is mainly because blue whales are always in search of food to satisfy their large appetites, so their movements are geared more toward finding food sources than adhering to strict migratory paths.

Although there are a number of distinct blue whale populations, they can broadly be grouped into those that reside in the Northern Hemisphere and those that are found in the Southern Hemisphere. One of the larger populations in the Northern Hemisphere is the estimated 2,000-something blue whales that feed off the coast of California and migrate to Costa Rica and Mexico, according to the Marine Mammal Center's website.

""Despite being so large, much of their specific movements and behaviors are still unknown to science, though,"" says Ratner of blue whales. It's also somewhat difficult to track them, because the satellite tagging that you might use on other marine mammals — like sea lions — could cause skin infection in whales. Scientists studying whales will often use a more basic photo identification system to keep track of specific blue whales around the world. ""Blue whales, much like many other whales, have unique markings on their skin and can be individuals can be identified by examining photos of whales in different areas of the world providing us a sense of their migration pattern and life history,"" says Ratner.

And, for some good news, according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, blue whale numbers have likely gone up in recent decades. So, things seem to be looking up for the blue giant."~[]

PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium says their 10-year-old African lion, Razi, has passed away.

The zoo says Razi suffered from a form of epilepsy, and had a grand mal seizure on Sunday. He fell in the exhibit and fractured his jaw.

According to the zoo, Razi’s caretakers determined it was not in his “best interest to attempt the difficult surgery needed” to repair his broken jaw, as well as the difficult post-surgery care it would take to get him back on his paws. They also said his seizure rate was increasing.

In a press release, Zoo President and CEO Barbara Baker said: “It is a sad day for all of us. Our animals are like members of our family and losing a family member is tough. Razi was a magnificent animal, and will also be missed by our visitors who developed a bond with him and his brother Ajani.”

It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our African lion, Razi. Many of us have developed a strong bond and attachment to our magnificent Razi over the years and he will be so deeply missed.

Razi was diagnosed with idiopathic epilepsy, a very rare condition in lions, in the spring of 2013, zoo officials said. He was being treated with anti-seizure medications for the condition.

The zoo’s Director of Animal Health Dr. Ginger Sturgeon says: “Razi was an amazing cat. He allowed us to get voluntary blood samples from his tail every couple of months to check his medication serum levels and his liver function. It’s so hard for all of us at the zoo to lose an animal we have cared so deeply for, but we try to remember all of the good memories and positive impact that he had on our zoo visitors.”

The zoo says they are keeping a very close on on Razi’s brother, Ajani, as the two were inseparable.

“They reached out to me and said, 'We want to get our designers and our artists in contact with zoos that have lions,” she told Denver7 about that initial call.

Hollie is the Vice President for Animal Care at the Denver Zoo. She also coordinates the species survival plan for lions for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, moving lions around the country to maintain strong breeding lions.

“We want a population that’s going to be stable long term, avoid in-breeding, that type of thing,” she said. “We want a population that’s sustainable long-term and we want to make sure that zoos that want lions have them.”

Sustaining the population in zoos is one thing. Increasing the population in the wild is another more pressing task.

“The first Lion King movie came out 25 years ago and since that time and this new movie coming out this summer, we’ve lost half the world’s lions,” she explained.

Today there are only about 20,000 lions in the wild. That’s down from 200,000 a century ago when they roamed ten times as much area in Africa as they do today.

Disney is hoping this new movie brings awareness to the plight of lions and is working with the Lion Recovery Fund, another organization Hollie is a part of, and other lion experts around the world on a project called Protect the Pride.

“I think if we see people walk out of that movie or walk away from what we’re talk about going ‘wow, lions are in trouble and I want to know how I can help,’ I think that would be a great success,” Hollie said.

“The good news is there are still enough lions and the population is still healthy enough that we can save them. We can bring them back.”"~[]

Bengwayan

The Philippines, the world’s second largest archipelago, is one of the few nations that is, in its entirety, both a hotspot and a megadiversity country, placing it among the top priority hotspots for global conservation.

But its unique biodiversity is threatened. Having the highest rates of discovery in the world with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years, such endemism however may be lost faster than discovered.

Threatened are 9,250 vascular plant species which includes gingers, begonias, gesneriads, orchids, pandans, palms, and dipterocarps. Some150 species of palms are included in the hotspot list and 70 percent of the 1,000 species of orchids found in the country.

Among its over 530 bird species, 35 percent or over 60 are threatened. These are found in seven Endemic Bird Area hotspots: Mindoro, Luzon, Negros and Panay, Cebu, Mindanao and the Eastern Visayas, the Sulu archipelago, and Palawan.

The best-known endangered bird species is the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi, CR), the second-largest eagle in the world. The Philippine eagle breeds only in primary lowland rain forest. Habitat destruction has extirpated the eagle everywhere except on the islands of Luzon, Mindanao and Samar, where the only large tracts of lowland rain forest remain. Today, the total population is estimated at less than 700 individuals. Captive breeding programs have been largely unsuccessful; habitat protection is the eagle’s only hope for survival.

The other threatened endemic species are the Negros bleeding art (Gallicolumba keayi, CR), Visayan wrinkled hornbill (Aceros waldeni, CR), Scarlet-collared flowerpecker (Dicaeum retrocinctum, VU), Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor, CR), and Philippine cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia, CR).

With regards mammals, the tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis, CR), a dwarf water buffalo that lives only on Mindoro Island is the most threatened. A century ago the population numbered 10,000 individuals; today only a few hundred animals exist in the wild.

Other mammals are endangered, like the Visayan and Philippine warty pigs (Sus cebifrons, CR and S. philippensis, VU); the Calamianes hog-deer (Axis calamaniensis, EN) and the Visayan spotted deer (Rusa alfredi, EN), which has been reduced to a population of a few hundred on the islands of Negros, Masbate and Panay; and the golden-capped fruit bat (Acerodon jubatus, EN), which, as the world’s largest bat, has a wingspan up to 1.7 meters.

In the reptilian world, the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis, CR) is considered the most threatened crocodilian in the world. Other unique and threatened reptiles include Gray’s monitor (Varanus olivaceus, VU), the Philippine pond turtle (Heosemys leytensis, CR) and a newly discovered monitor lizard, Varanus mabitang, only the second monitor species known in the world to specialize on a fruit diet.

Among all amphibians, 22 are considered threatened including the Philippine flat-headed frog (Barbourula busuangensis, VU), one of the world’s most primitive frog species.

With regards freshwater fishes, most threatene is Sardinella tawilis, a freshwater sardine found only in Taal Lake. Sadly, Lake Lanao, in Mindanao, seems likely to have become the site of one of the hotspots worst extinction catastrophes, with nearly all of the lakes endemic fish species now almost certainly extinct.

Man’s Destruction of Forests All but Decimated Most of RP’s Biodiversity

Forests, the Philippines’ leading natural habitat of the country’s biodiversity, are rapidly disappearing. By 2040, there may be no virgin forests, many forestry experts predict. Non-believers scoff at this, saying it is an exaggeration. But the figures cannot be wrong. The effects of deforestation are not figments of imagination.

The rate of deforestation in the country is among the highest in the world. The worst deforestation happened during the period of 1990 to 1999 where 750,000 acres of virgin forest were lost. Today, only 1.75 million acres remain of the nation’s virgin forests.

The loss is incredible, the rate of deforestation in that decade was almost 75,000 acres a year. It also came at a time when logging ban was imposed in some selected sites in the country.

As a result, flooding, soil erosion and degradation pegged at 100,000 tons of soil yearly, loss of species diversity and genetic material, loss of human lives and properties and aesthetic and recreational loss were at their worst.

Much of the blame is on the government that, over the years, have passed laws favorable to logging concessions and implemented forest protection poorly. Government negligence has prompted the devastation of the forests. Today, much of the remaining forests are still being invaded by commercial loggers.

Philippine forestry laws passed since 1930 have failed to provide adequate security provisions for virgin and secondary growth forests, thus the forests had virtually no protection at all. For instance, there is only one forest guard for every 7,500 acres.

But even then, many official policies and strategies from the very start were faulty.

And many polices continue to be faulty.

comeback using the Siberian tiger subspecies, which detected genetic similarities with the Caspian tiger. But here the question arises that can Iran get a second chance to return the big cats and not lose them again?

Once the tigers were predicted to soon become extinct in the world if effective conservation measures are not deployed, July 29 was observed as a day dedicated to awareness and support worldwide to conserve the tigers whose population dropped dramatically to less than 4,000 individuals in the wild.

Caspian tiger’s roar has not been heard for years

Once upon a time, the Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris virgata) ranged from eastern Turkey through the southern Caspian region of northern Iran to the forested areas in Afghanistan, and northwestern China.

Since the beginning of 19th century, the Caspian tiger was rapidly losing ground to humankind, thus it was deprived of its habitat and prey and soon became a beast in its own territory, so conflicts started to hunt them down as a menace to human settlements.

Therefore, in the mid-20th century, their population whose genetic roots spanned over a million years started to shrink sharply, and finally vanished by the 1950s.

Although, there are reports of the last remaining Caspian tiger which was shot in Golestan National Park in 1953, five years later, some claimed that a tiger has been spotted in Golestan area.

The Department of Environment’s experts have tried to find evidence of Caspian tiger existence searching their previous habitats for several years in the early 1970s, but not a single sign has been found.

Caspian tigers had been protected since 1957, with heavy fines for shooting, but it was too late for the majestic cat to make a recovery. Excessive hunting, poaching, habitat fragmentation, food shortages, poisoning and trapping wiped out the valuable species.

An old picture of Caspian tiger in Iran

Initial attempts to bring back formidable tigers

In the Iranian calendar year 1389 (March 2009- March 2010), two Siberian tigers were sent to Iran from Russia in exchange of two Persian Leopards; aiming to restore the Caspian tiger generation in the country, but after a while the male one died due to an outbreak of glanders (an infectious disease occurs primarily by ingestion of contaminated food or water).

The female tiger was quarantined for five years on the charge of being infected with the virus, but with the help of wildlife enthusiasts and the DOE after undergoing several medical tests, the animal was then moved to a suitable place in Tehran Zoo.

DNA tests added a spark of hope to the sad story

Although, 8 subspecies of tigers have been identified, in 2004 scientists revised the known classification to five subspecies from those previously identified, as they had been from a genetic standpoint that were separated by humans after years.

Lately, researchers and studies proposed that restoring the lost cats is possible, as the Siberian or Amur tiger show genetic kinship to the Caspian, because they once ruled from Caspian Sea's south shore to the forest areas of China and Korea, north to the forested edges of Siberia, while human cleaved their territory in two, separating the Caspian tiger from the Siberian.

But the question come up that whether the current nature of Iran has the capacity to accept and remain such an enormous species? And is it possible to revive a species which once gone extinct in the same region?

How Caspian tiger faded away in Iran?

Kaveh Feizollahi, a zoologist and an expert in the field of tigers, told IRNA that “tigers are flexible species which can adopt to a wide range of habitat and climate conditions, from the tropical regions of Asia to the ever-snowy areas of Siberia.

On the other hand, their reproductive rate is relatively high and the gap between the regenerations is short; it can change its hunting technique depending on the prey and habitat. However, some of its features have made it vulnerable to human development in West Asia.

The first feature of tigers which caused them to disappear was tiger's dependence on the water resources and its presence near river basins, lake edges and sea shores, where the highest concentration of human population exists and the conflicts pushed them toward extinction.

The second one is related to the prey, the natural prey they mainly fed on was deer, and they attracted to northern Iran probably because of the good population of red deer and roe deer.

However, with population of deer declined, the tiger was inevitably feeding on the wild boar, which has severe population fluctuations and is a temporary source of food.

The third item is hunting, tiger hunting intensified during their final periods living in Iran, due to the reduction of prey and hunting livestock.

Tiger cubs were also captured for illegal trade, in addition, land use changes, superstitions and using their organs in traditional medicine were among the other factors eradicated tigers.”

Is it possible to bring back the vanished Caspian tiger?

Feizollahi went on to say that “the word ""possibility"" is usually used in two distinct meanings; if the word means the possibility of a theoretical and scientific idea in an ideal setting, then the answer is yes.

But it is very unlikely, as it is used in its daily sense, according to the records and conditions of the country's wildlife.

Assuming that the word ""possibility"" has been used in the first sense, it should be said that before any such project is started, a feasibility study must first be prepared. However, such a report was not prepared till December 2010, when the DOE representatives went to St. Petersburg to attend the international tiger conservation forum.”

“Certainly, there is no proper habitat for tiger in Iran. If there are intentions to revive the tiger population in Iran, or, in other words, to ensure a stable population of it, a natural habitat must be prepared, including, good vegetation cover, clean water and enough bait.

Before restoring the Caspian tiger in the country, other species of red and roe deer must be increased; for example, 20 tigers in a hypothetical area may need a population of 10,000 large mammals, which may take several years to expand.

After that, the tigers must gradually enter the prepared area; If there is no wild tiger, the tigers kept in captivity should be used as a parent and re-wild their cubs.

The whole process is very difficult, costly, and time consuming.

What the DOE did, the transfer of two Siberian tigers from a Russia to a wildlife park in Iran has nothing to do with a conservation program,” he explained.

He went on to add that to start conservation process, one should initially notice the reason behind Caspian tiger reintroduction in Iran; merely restoring an extinct species out of curiosity or enthusiasm toward history, or using a flag species to attract people's attention and support, while playing the international role of Iran in protecting global biodiversity.

Why conservation of tigers is important?

“In fact, saving the tiger from extinction and maintaining its habitat is the biggest concern of the international community for the conservation of biodiversity, because if we cannot save a precious and flexible specie like tiger from extinction, there is no hope to save the more unknown species that do not attract attention, and the world will be depopulated of animals.

According to an article released in 2010, the cost of protecting each wild tiger was estimated at $10,000 per year, while the price of a tiger skin on the smuggling market is twice that.

This will require an annual budget of $40 million to protect tigers in the world. One of the conservation activists pointed out that the budget in global economy is less than a drop of water,” he concluded.

China has built a monitoring network for engendered Siberian tigers and Amur leopards, covering more than 12,000 square kilometers in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, after nearly 20 years' efforts, said an official on Sunday.

Jiang Guangshun, deputy director of Feline Research Center of the Natural Forestry and Grassland Administration, made the remarks at the International Forum on Tiger and Leopard Transboundary Conservation in Harbin, Heilongjiang province.

With cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data, Jiang and his team have recorded more than 4,000 infrared camera video clips of tigers and more than 600 clips of leopards, according to Jiang's report about conservation and management of Siberian tigers and Amur leopards at the forum.

""By comparing the data of tigers and leopards of China and Russia from 2013 to 2015, we confirmed that 17 tigers and 42 leopards are shared populations of both China and Russia,"" he said. ""Ecological environment has greatly improved since the natural forest protection project started in 1998 and all commercial logging has been stopped, which helped in protecting of tigers and leopards.""

""However, we still face great challenges in the following areas,"" he said. ""Distribution pattern of the two species suggests that the protection of the Amur tiger and leopard requires the establishment of a network of protected patch sites, the construction of international and domestic corridors, and the formation of a permeable landscape. It needs attention and support from all over the world.""

""The protection also needs an international research team to improve the level of the global transboundary data and management of tigers and leopards,"" Jiang added.

Focusing on big cats all around the world, especially tiger and leopard populations, the two-day event attracted more than 300 representatives from 19 regional countries, including Nepal, Russia, Vietnam, and 10 international organizations, including World Wildlife Fund.

Representatives will have discussions on monitoring technology, restoration of populations and habitats, landscape resource allocation in protected areas, conflict resolution and other related technical and policy issues.

Furthermore, the establishment of international exchange and cooperation mechanism for cross-border protection of tigers and leopards is expected to get important progress in the future."~[]

On Sunday, a southern white rhino named Victoria gave birth to a healthy calf through hormone-induced ovulation and artificial insemination.

San Diego Zoo Global explained that the birth lasted 30 minutes and that both Victoria and the calf are doing well. It was the first successful artificial insemination birth of a southern white rhino in North America.

This scientific victory is important because it may help researchers save other species on the brink of extinction or nearing that status.

San Diego Zoo Global’s goal is to potentially utilize the southern white rhinos as surrogates to northern white rhinos, and to use “assisted reproduction” in order to save the species. Unfortunately only two northern white rhino females remain alive, impeding the survival of the species. The last male northern white rhino, Sudan, died earlier this year.

In order to achieve this goal there are many steps that need to be taken. From sequencing their genome to converting cells to stem cells and developing sperm and eggs. The process has already begun in the laboratory of Jeanne Loring, Ph.D., of The Scripps Research Institute. The researchers optimistically speculate that this could happen within 10 to 20 years.

As for Victoria and her newborn, they will be kept off exhibit to allow their bond to grow. Eventually they will join the other five female rhinos who are also under the care of the San Diego Zoo.

Additionally, another southern white rhino is pregnant through assisted reproduction and is due to give birth later this year.

The white rhino is classified as Near Threatened, and around 18,000 remain in the wild. The decline of the population is due to poaching and illegal trafficking of their horn. A rhino dies every eight hours in South Africa as a result of poaching, according to San Diego Zoo Global.

The public can help support San Diego Zoo Global’s rhino conservation efforts through the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy."~[]

PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – A Montgomery County zoo will be adding an exhibit for the largest cat in the world after receiving a donation from a garbage collection service. The Elmwood Park Zoo announced Thursday the J.P. Mascaro & Sons Foundation donated $2 million for the addition of a brand new Amur tiger exhibit.

Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest cats in the world and are a highly threatened species.

The Elmwood Park Zoo says the tigers can still be found in parts of the forest in eastern Russia, parts of China, and possibly North Korea.

This is the first time in the zoo’s 95-year history that tigers will call the Norristown zoo home.

The exhibit is expected to open in 2022.

“J. P. Mascaro & Sons Foundations has provided a tremendous amount of support to the community for many, many years. It’s truly inspiring,” said Al Zone, Elmwood Park Zoo Executive Director and CEO. “They’ve also funded several of the zoo’s programs and services, which has benefited thousands of our guests and the people we meet in our community outreach. J. P. Mascaro & Sons Foundations has helped the zoo to grow and succeed, and their gift of a new tiger exhibit promises to take us to a whole new level.”

The donation is being made in memory of Francesco A. Mascaro and Rosemarie Mascaro Venditti, siblings of the Mascaro company owners.

“The Elmwood Park Zoo in Norristown is a quality operation that is enjoyed by local area residents. Our family has its roots in the Norristown area, and we are happy to be able to make the zoo’s new tiger exhibit a reality,” said Joseph P. Mascaro, Jr., the oldest of the Mascaro brothers. “My brother Frank always had a soft spot in his heart for the zoo, and no one loved animals more than my sister, Rosie. Our company is pleased to make this tiger exhibit donation to the zoo in their memory.”"~[]

The mother, Victoria, was artificially inseminated in March of 2018 and carried the calf for a whopping 493 days before giving birth (can you imagine being pregnant that long?!). This is the first southern white rhino born at the San Diego Zoo after artificial insemination, and the calf’s name is Edward.

“This birth is significant, as it also represents a critical step in our effort to save the northern white rhino from the brink of extinction,” Barbara Durrant, director of reproductive science at San Diego Zoo Global, told The Washington Post in an interview.

How can one species help another? Well, the northern white rhino is related to the southern white rhino, albeit distantly, and only two documented northern white rhinos are alive today (yes, this is horrible). Both of the living northern white rhinos are female, but scientists managed to preserve sperm from males in the species.

Scientists hope that eventually, southern white rhinos will be able to be surrogate mothers for northern white rhino embryos. It’s not possible quite yet, but researchers hope to have a successful birth within 10 to 20 years.

In the meantime, however, it is more than enough to celebrate young Edward’s birthday. The calf and his mother are currently bonding outside of the exhibit and he won’t be visible to the public for a few more months, but zookeepers say the pair are doing well. They posted photos and video to their Twitter account, and it’s easy to see that mom and baby are already a loving pair:

Animal care staff reported that Victoria did extremely well and remained calm during the 30-minute labor. The calf is nursing well, and mother and baby are bonding in a quiet nursing setting. pic.twitter.com/qsyOQMLmRY — San Diego Zoo Safari Park (@sdzsafaripark) July 29, 2019

“All of us at San Diego Zoo Global are elated with the arrival of this special rhino calf,” Durrant said in a press release about the birth. “We are so pleased Victoria and the calf are doing well. She is very attentive to her baby, and the calf is up and walking, and nursing frequently.”

We can’t wait to see more photos of Edward as he grows!

Only two females of this species remain – a captive-born mother and daughter named Najin (40) and Fatu (19), who are both being kept in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Sudan, the father and grandfather to the females, was the last male of the species and died in 2018.

“With the Northern White Rhino species dangerously on the verge of extinction, we consider it our responsibility, as industry leaders in the assisted reproductive technologies for the last 60 years, to offer our help through innovative medical technologies before it’s too late,” says Marie-Andrée Gamache, Managing Director at Merck (Pty) Ltd, English Portuguese Speaking Africa (EPA).

The BioRescue Project, receiving funding of around four million Euro from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), is led by Prof Thomas Hildebrandt from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW), and comprises a global team of scientists and conservationists from Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, Japan and the USA.

The project takes a two-pronged approach to prevent the extinction of the species – in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and stem cell conversions.

IVF

As Najin and Fatu are too old and physically unable to carry a pregnancy to term themselves, their egg cells will be harvested for later use in an IVF procedure (with the permission of the Kenyan government). Fortunately, Sudan’s semen was harvested before he died and is stored at minus 196 degrees Celsius in equipment supplied by Merck, at the Leibniz-IZW.

The fertilization and maturation of the embryos will be carried out at the Avantea Center in Italy, a laboratory of advanced technologies for animal reproduction and biotechnology research, using the Geri® and Geri® Connect and Assess systems from Merck for displaying and remotely evaluating information from distributed devices, to ensure the maximum chance of success.

The embryo obtained will then be transferred into the uterus of a Southern White Rhinoceros via embryo transfer and carried to term by the surrogate mother.

The stem cell approach

For the second approach, the Leibniz-IZW team is cooperating with renowned international stem cell experts with the aim of converting skin cells into pluripotent stem cells (master cells that can give rise to all of the cell types that make up the body) and then maturing them into primordial germ cells (the precursors of sperm and eggs).

In a trial study, the team has already been able to convert skin cells into pluripotent cells, which will be further improved in future.

“The desired outcome will be a self-sustaining, genetically healthy population of Northern White Rhinoceroses that can survive in the wild,” said Richard Vigne – Managing Director of the Ol Pejeta Conservancy.

“Due to the small number of eggs and sperm available, the stem cell approach is important in order to increase the genetic variability of the population.”

The BioRescue project will also consider the ethical issues that could arise following an approach of this type, which is particularly innovative and absolutely revolutionary.

These issues will be openly addressed by the consortium, through the promotion of public debate to identify the right answers to the ethical responsibilities of scientists, governments and citizens regarding biodiversity conservation activities.

Saving the Northern White Rhino is the first such project to use ART to save a species from extinction. After the project, Merck will explore whether our innovative technologies could help any other endangered species in need, potentially slowing or completely preventing the current extinction rate of as many as 2,000 species per year."~[]

IDAHO FALLS — For the first time ever a red panda has been born at the Idaho Falls Zoo. Over the next week or so, you can see the male cub in the Primate Center and watch him being fed at 11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. daily.

You’ll want to jump on the opportunity to see him as he won’t be at the Idaho Falls Zoo for very long. He’ll actually be flown via private jet to his new home at Zoo Knoxville in Tennessee very soon.

Delilah, the zoo’s six-year-old female, gave birth to two cubs on June 29. Unfortunately, one cub passed away shortly after birth. But, the other is doing very well and growing each day. It’s not uncommon for first-time moms to exhibit confusion or disinterest in raising young so the cub is being hand-raised by zoo staff to ensure its health and wellbeing. As it’s not possible for the cub to be returned to his mother, Idaho Falls Zoo animal care staff have been in touch with red panda Species Survival Plan (SSP) representatives at Zoo Knoxville.

Red pandas are endangered so each new cub is extremely important to the future of the species. Your Idaho Falls Zoo participates in the red panda SSP. An SSP is a cooperatively-managed breeding program between facilities accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) that manages captive threatened or endangered species.

He will continue to be hand-raised at Zoo Knoxville with other red panda cubs as being raised with others of his species is crucial to their healthy development.

“We, of course, want to give this little cub the best chance possible for a healthy future,” says Zoo Director David Pennock, “and that means ensuring he’s raised with other cubs of his species.”

The little cub is especially dear to the zoo as his father, Winston, passed away this week due to a medical issue. Zoo staff will be working with the red panda SSP representatives to find a new mate for Delilah.

Part of being an AZA-accredited organization is always providing the highest level of professional attention and welfare for the animals in our care as they serve as ambassadors for their wild counterparts. The red panda cub is a perfect example of the level of professional care provided to animals in accredited organizations as he’ll be flown to Zoo Knoxville in comfort and style aboard a private plane."~[]

A male Persian lion, born 6 years ago, was sent to Tehran Zoological Garden from Britain’s Bristol Zoo on May 1, under a population management program aiming at endangered species reproduction by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).

A female lion of the same subspecies from Ireland also sent to Iran to accompany the male lion through the conservation program.

The female lion has so far met her male companion, but this time they are going to live in together after two months after being introduced to each other, Mehr quoted Iman Memarian as saying on Saturday.

Most animals recognize other animals by sight or smell, although other cues could be used, such as sounds. Odors are also used as cues to familiarity or genetic relatedness in mammals, birds, amphibians, fish and insects; odors mainly come from general sweat glands or from specialized glands in the skin, he explained.

“Some wild species even kill each other after being introduced; therefore, we are so cautious about the lion couple and are under supervision since next few days,” he added.

Referring to reproduction of Asiatic lion, he said that there is not a specific plan yet unless one is announced by European Endangered species Programme (EEP).

Currently, the two animals are controlled with contraceptives, he stated, adding, they undergo birth control measures as long as the purpose for their captive breeding is determined.

Over the past years, Tehran Zoological Garden has succeeded in becoming a member of EAZA, and it is being supervised to ensure the animal’s safety, he highlighted, adding, “We met the internationally defined standards.”

He went on to add that the male lion is the only Persian lion, as its twin sibling died due to severe respiratory problems.

Considering that Persian lion is a symbol in Iran’s wildlife, since past 80 years, many efforts have been taken to turn the valuable species back to the country which faced failure due to different reasons, he noted.

“As selling or buying animals in European zoos is banned, after 8 years of efforts, we could turn the couple back due to our compliance with the EAZA standards,” he said.

Disappeared for 80 years, Persian lion once prowled from the Middle East to India, while currently only a fraction of these magnificent animals survive in the wild, which range is restricted to the Gir National Park and environs in the Indian state of Gujarat.

On the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy. It was also known as ""Indian lion"" and ""Persian lion"".

Historical records in Iran indicate that it ranged from the Khuzestan Plain to the Fars in steppe vegetation and pistachio-almond woodlands. It was widespread in the country, but in the 1870s, it was sighted only on the western slopes of the Zagros Mountains, and in the forest regions south of Shiraz. Some of the country's last lions were sighted in 1941 between

Shiraz and Jahrom in Fars province, and in 1942, a lion was spotted about 65 km northwest of Dezful. In 1944, the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of Karun River in Khuzestan province.

Conflicts with humans, wildfires, poaching, canine distemper virus, decreases in population sizes of native ungulates are of the threats to the lions.

science contributor traci pedersen~"Lions once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe, but are now only found in parts of Africa and India.

Lions are the second-largest cats in the world, after tigers . Known as the ""king of beasts"" or ""king of the jungle,"" these regal felines once roamed Africa, Asia and Europe, but now only live in parts of Africa and India.

Experts have long recognized two subspecies of lion, Panthera leo leo (the African lion) and Panthera leo persica (the Asiatic lion). However, recent studies suggest that lions from West and Central Africa are more closely related to Asian lions than they are to lions from the eastern and southern parts of Africa, according to the Cat Specialist Group, a component of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2017, the Cat Specialist Group published their reclassification of lions into two new subspecies: Panthera leo leo (also called the Northern subspecies) and Panthera leo melanochaita (the Southern subspecies).

Panthera leo leo includes lion populations in Central Africa, West Africa (West African or Senegal lion), India (Asiatic lion) and extinct populations previously found in North Africa (Barbary lion), southeastern Europe, the Middle East, the Arabian peninsula and southwestern Asia. Panthera leo melanochaita includes lion populations from southern parts of Africa (Katanga lion and the Southeast African lion) and East Africa (Masai lion and Ethiopian lion).

Although the West African and Asiatic lions are genetically similar, many of their physical characteristics and behaviors are slightly different. [ In Photos: The Lions of Kenya's Masai Mara ]

How big are lions?

African lions can grow to between 9 and 10 feet long (3 meters) from head to tail, with the tail being about 2 to 3 feet long (60 to 91 centimeters), according to the Smithsonian National Zoo . They typically weigh between 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms), with males reaching the higher end of that range.

Asiatic lions (also called Asian or Indian lions) are slightly smaller than African lions. They are 6.6 to 9.2 feet (2 to 2.8 m) long from head to tail and weigh between 242 to 418 pounds (110 to 190 kg), according to the World Wildlife Federation (WWF).

Lions tend to have loose skin hanging from their midsection, possibly to help protect them from the piercing hooves of their frantic prey. Asiatic lions also have a fold of skin that runs along their belly, a feature rarely seen in African lions, according to African Lion and Environmental Research Trust (ALERT), a research and conservation organization. Compared to African lions, Asiatic lions tend to have shaggier coats, longer hair tufts on their elbows, and a longer tassel on the end of their tail. [ Photos: The Biggest Lions on Earth ]

Not only are male lions generally larger than females, but they also have a distinctive thick mane of hair around their heads that females lack. The biggest and most fabulous manes are more impressive to mating females and more intimidating to competing males, according to the San Diego Zoo . The mane also protects the male's neck during fights over territory or mating rights. African lions tend to have bigger, more magnificent manes compared to their Asiatic cousins.

Where do lions live?

African lions live in Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Tanzania, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Male lions defend the pride’s territory, which may include an area of 100 square miles (259 square kilometers) of shrubs, grasslands and open woodlands, according to National Geographic .

Asiatic lions are found only in the Indian state of Gujarat, Western India, where most reside in the protected Gir Forest National Park , a 545-square-mile (1,412-square-km) wildlife haven. The Indian government designated this land, which includes a deciduous forest, grasslands, scrub jungle and rocky hills, as a wildlife sanctuary in 1965, according to Gir National Park . In addition to more than 500 lions and 300 leopards, the park is home to deer, antelope, jackal, hyenas, foxes, reptiles and more than 200 species of birds.

Lion pride dynamics

Lions are social cats and live in groups called prides. Asiatic and African lion prides are very different, though.

African lion prides typically consist of up to three adult males and around a dozen females and their young, according to National Geographic . Some prides can get extremely large, however, with up to 40 members. Females tend to remain in the pride in which they are born, so they are usually related to each other. Males, on the other hand, wander off to create their own pride when they are old enough.

Asiatic male lions normally won't live with the females of their pride unless they’re mating or have a large kill, according to the Zoological Society of London .

Hunting

African lions tend to hunt large animals such as antelopes, zebras , hogs, rhinos , hippos and wildebeest . Asiatic lions also hunt large animals, including buffaloes , goats , nilgai (a large Asian antelope), chital and sambar (two types of deer). Lions can kill animals that weigh up to 1,000 pounds, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo , but they will also hunt smaller animals like mice and birds when opportunities arise.

Females are the main hunters of the pride, and work cooperatively in hunting parties to surround and take down prey. Lions can run up to 50 mph (80 kmph) for short distances and leap as far as 36 feet (11 m), almost the length of a school bus, according to the Lion Habitat Ranch , a lion sanctuary in Nevada. To bring prey down, lions jump on the backs of very large animals, but will ""ankle-tap"" smaller animals, meaning they reach out their paw and swipe the preys' legs to trip them up, according to ALERT . To kill their prey, lions use their powerful jaws to snap the animal's neck or to strangle it to death.

Very occasionally, males will join in the hunting action, particularly if the prey is extremely large, like an elephant or water buffalo . Otherwise, the main job of the male is to protect the pride. African males who live alone tend to hide in dense vegetation to engage in ambush-style hunting, according to Carnegie researchers.

Lions tend to hunt at night and often lurk around water holes , streams and rivers, as those areas are hotspots for prey. Lions will also scavenge, and won't hesitate to steal other predators' kills or eat the leftovers, according to ALERT.

Mating and raising young

Male lions reach sexual maturity around two years old but are unlikely to breed before the age of 4 or 5 when they are large enough to attempt to take over a pride and have breeding rights, according to ALERT . Males as old as 16 can still produce viable sperm but usually lose their mating rights once they can no longer fight off younger males. Male African lions that are trying to take over a pride will kill all of the cubs to avoid competition. [ In Photos: A Lion's Life ]

Most female lions give birth by the time they are 4 years old. The gestation period for lions is around four months. Females will give birth to their young away from others, and will hide the cubs for the first six weeks of their lives. At birth, the cubs only weigh around 2 to 4 pounds. (0.9 to 1.8 kg), according to Animal Corner , and they're completely dependent on their mother.

All of the females in a pride will mate at around the same time. After the first six weeks of rearing cubs alone, the mother and cubs will rejoin the pride. Other females in the pride will contribute to raising all of their pride's young, and will even nurse other mothers' cubs, according to the San Diego Zoo .

Conservation status

Lions are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN's Red List of Threatened Species . Three-quarters of African lion populations are in decline; their current population is estimated at 20,000 in the wild, according to the World Wildlife Federation (WWF). The population has been almost cut in half in the past two decades because of retaliatory killings by farmers (whose livestock lions eat), as well as from trophy hunting and habitat loss.

Asiatic lions are in an even more perilous position as human encroachment has reduced their habitat. The most recent census, taken in 2015, counted 523 lions living in Gir Forest National Park, according to PBS.org . Although small, this number is welcome news as the population has grown by about 27% since 2010, which suggests conservation measures are having a positive effect.

Dolly has been doing a great job of caring for the cubs, as she had with previous litters. Zoo Boise staff have been giving the family as much privacy as possible. This is to make sure Dolly does not become stressed continue to take care of the cubs.

Weekly check-ups show the cubs are healthy and growing. On August 6, both cubs weighed around one pound.

The red panda parents have been matched as part of the Red Panda Species Survival Program (SSP). The SSP is one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums conservation programs. The primary role is to serve as a breeding program for selected endangered or threatened species. The goal is maintain a healthy and diverse population for animals in order to increase their numbers and reintroduce certain zoo-bred animals into their natural habitats.

The naming rights for the cubs will be auctioned off at Zoobilee, Zoo Boise's annual gala, on September 13."~[]

Edward and his mother Victoria galloped around the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center exhibit for about 30 minutes before relaxing in the mud wallow, according to a Safari Park spokesperson.

“The second they entered the exhibit, Victoria just took off, running laps,” said Jill Van Kempen, senior keeper. “It was so fun to see Edward running right along beside her. He was very energetic, sometimes breathing heavily, and even getting all four feet off the ground at times.”

Though mother Victoria has already roamed the main exhibit, today’s outing was Edward’s first time exploring it.

The three-week-old has gained 95 pounds since he was born on July 28, now weighing in at 243 pounds.

Edward is the first southern white rhino to be born via artificial insemination in North America. Researchers estimate there are only about 18,000 southern white rhinos in the wild.

The calf is part of the Safari Park’s Rhino Rescue program to help revive the related northern white rhino species. Northern white rhinos are nearly extinct, with only two females left on Earth.

Researchers plan to use stem cells, preserved northern white rhino cells and artificial insemination into southern white rhino surrogates to birth a northern white rhino calf in the next decade or two.

Edward, the southern white rhino, experienced is first trot around the San Diego Zoo Safari Park's Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center Monday.

With his mom, Victoria, leading the way, Edward charged around the enclosure and even fit a mud bath into his busy schedule. It was the first time the mom and calf were released from the center's maternity yard and other off-exhibit areas.

“Victoria has been in the exhibit yard before but this was Edward’s first time,” said Jill Van Kempen, senior keeper at San Diego Zoo Safari Park. “The second they entered the exhibit, Victoria just took off, running laps, and it was so fun to see Edward running right along beside her. He was very energetic, sometimes breathing heavily, and even getting all four feet off the ground at times.”

For about 30 minutes, the zoo says Edward and Victoria took advantage of the larger space by running around and stretching their legs.

Edward was born 23 days ago, becoming the first southern white rhino calf born via artificial insemination in the country. Edward was born weighing about 148 pounds, but now weighs about 243 pounds.

San Diego Zoo official hope the historic birth now helps genetically recover the north white rhino species, a distant subspecies of which only two remain on Earth — both female.

Visitors to the Safari Park may catch Edward and Victoria from the Africa Tram as zookeepers rotate them, and five other southern white rhinos at the rescue center, in and out of the exhibit yard.

Mother Naomi is doing well and is being very attentive to the cubs, who appear to be healthy. All are being monitored behind the scenes by the Zoo’s veterinary and Heart of Africa animal care teams.

This is the first litter for 4-year-old Naomi. Her pregnancy was a surprise since the cub’s sire, Tomo, underwent a vasectomy in 2018 because his genes are strongly represented within the African Lion Species Survival Program (SSP) population. After the procedure, he rejoined the zoo’s five lionesses in the Heart of Africa. However, while rare, vasectomy procedures can sometimes fail in both humans and wildlife.

Tomo was humanely euthanized in May at the age of 15 after his quality of life rapidly diminished due to age-related issues, including degenerative joint disease and kidney disease resulting in the inability to stand.

Naomi is also Tomo’s daughter, and he mated with her before his rapid health decline. Since female cubs stay with their birth pride, African lions in their native ranges are known at times to mate with their own offspring if another male has not been able to successfully establish himself as the new leader of the pride. Zoological facilities accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) manage prides with the intent to maximize genetic diversity for lions and utilize contraceptive measures, though rare situations can occur, as in this case. There’s no established evidence that this type of familial breeding increases genetic problems.

According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species™, lions are listed as a vulnerable species, and they continue to be under increasing pressure in their native ranges in Africa. The Columbus Zoo has provided approximately $130,000 in the past five years to promote the co-existence of people and wildlife, such as helping farmers fence their kraals to prevent lions from harming livestock and increasing anti-snaring patrols, aerial surveillance, and veterinary interventions.

“We are committed to the work the Columbus Zoo is doing to protect lions in Africa, as well as inspiring our guests to join us in taking action to help lions and other species. We are very grateful for their support of the zoo as it is also benefiting important conservation initiatives and having a direct impact on saving wildlife in their native ranges,” said Columbus Zoo President/CEO Tom Stalf.

Find out how many red pandas are left in the world, and how you can help.

Endearing, but endangered

The red panda is one of the cutest animals in the world. Its fluffy rust-colored coat, sweet smile, and tiny, attentive eyes make it difficult for us to imagine a more adorable animal. Unfortunately, the red panda is an endangered species, and there are only a few of these little guys left in the wild. In honor of upcoming Red Panda Day on September 21st, learn more facts about the red panda, and what humans can do to help them.

Where do the remaining red pandas live?

Red pandas live in the “dense forests of the mid-hills of the Himalaya,” according to the journal of Global Ecology and Conservation. This means that red pandas like to live predominantly in Nepal, where they make their homes in high-altitude forests with lots of bamboo plants to crunch on. They also live in northern Myanmar, southern Tibet, and central China. Red pandas like to spend their time in trees, where they can sunbathe and stay safe from predators, like birds of prey and sneaky snow leopards. Like its relative, the giant panda, red pandas rely on bamboo as its dietary staple. These panda facts will make you love them even more.

Why are red pandas endangered?

As is the case with many other animals, the primary existential threat to red pandas is (drumroll please…) human behavior! And we’re not shocked. Humans and human-caused environmental degradation are a threat to “99 percent of currently threatened species,” according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Human behaviors that affect red pandas include poaching, habitat destruction, and trafficking. According to a report by the NGO wildlife organization, Traffic, red panda fur is illegally trafficked and used to create clothing and hats. However, there’s some good news: while conducting interviews in Southwestern China about wildlife trade, this organization discovered that the younger generations no longer like to wear animal fur products. In addition to outside threats, red pandas are also threatened by their infrequent windows of fertility, and low rate of reproduction.

What are nations doing to protect the red panda?

Smithsonian reports that red pandas are “legally protected in India, Bhutan, China, Nepal, and Myanmar.” However, a report by the National Trust for Nature Conservation, hosted by the Government of Nepal, points to “poor conservation awareness and weak law enforcement” to be a contributing factor in the devastating population loss of red pandas. Though the Nepalese government has listed red pandas as an endangered species, “little research work has been conducted due to lack of funding.” Despite this, the Government of Nepal and its cooperators aims to increase cooperation with conservation agencies, diversify the income of the population so they aren’t tempted to hunt red pandas, and control grazing zones for local livestock.

Exactly how many red pandas are left?

According to the World Wildlife Fund, there are less than 10,000 red pandas left in the world. To put that number into perspective, keep in mind that red pandas are only two-foot long. If we could put all of Earth’s red pandas into one place and line them up back-to-back, they would fit comfortably onto a (57,600 square ft.) football field. In fact, the entire red panda population would only reach midfield. Ten thousand may seem like a large number, but not when it comes to the population of a species. There are approximately 753,000 times more human beings than red pandas on Earth, with the human population predicted to reach 8.5 billion people by 2030. Here are other animals that could disappear in your lifetime.

How can I help?

If you want to personally contribute to the effort to save red pandas, you can donate to anti-poaching efforts like The Red Panda Network, adopt a red panda from the World Wildlife Fund, or donate to organizations that are fighting deforestation. Efforts like these have worked to bring back these animals from the brink of extinction. Next, find out how many cheetahs are left in the world."~[]

The death of the last male northern white rhino, Sudan, in 2018 was believed to have virtually left the species with no hope of progressing another generation.

The International Rhino Foundation have expressed great concerns after the death of Sudan. A spokesperson stated: “The death of this animal also has larger implications for rhinos and other wildlife species across the globe, and brings a tragic reminder that systematic poaching that led to the demise of the northern white rhino in the first place is continuing to decimate African rhinos across the African continent. This is yet another wake-up call. This subspecies is going to go extinct before our eyes. And it could foretell the future for other rhinos, like the Javan and Sumatran rhino, which exist only in tiny populations of fewer than 100 in Indonesia.”

But thanks to stores of frozen sperm from northern white rhinos the species is not quite doomed.

Conservation scientists in Kenya successfully harvested 10 eggs from the world’s last two northern white rhinos, Najin and Fatsu. The scientists were proud to say that 7 out of the 10 eggs have since been matured and artificially inseminated with the frozen sperm from two northern white rhino bulls, Suni and Saut.

Scientists are now hoping the fertilised eggs will create viable embryos which can be frozen and then later be transferred in to surrogate mothers.

Cesare Galli of Avantea in Cremona led the fertilisation project. He said: “We were surprised by the high rate of maturation achieved as we do not get such high rate (comparable to what we get with horse oocytes) with southern white rhino females in European zoos. The semen of Saut was very difficult to work with and to find three live sperms needed for the eggs of Najin we had to thaw two batches of semen. Now the injected oocytes are incubated, and we need to wait to see if any viable embryo develop to the stage where it can be cryopreserved for later transfer.”"~[]

#CITESCoP18 this morning formally adopted 3 proposals, submitted by a record number of Parties, to include 18 new #shark species (i.e. mako sharks, guitarfishes & wedgefishes) in #CITES Appendix II. pic.twitter.com/J4WmMGaLYl — CITES (@CITES) August 28, 2019

In her closing comments, CITES Secretary-General Ivonne Higuero welcomed the fact that signatories to the Convention had supported wildlife trade that is “sustainable, legal, traceable”.

She also warned against complacency in the face of illegal trading linked to criminal gangs operating online.

From fish to trees and mammals, 183 parties hear species’ survival is essential to planet

“Humanity needs to respond to the growing extinction crisis by transforming the way we manage the world’s wild animals and plants. Business as usual is no longer an option,” she said.

From commercially fished species to trees and mammals – including for the first time, giraffes – the 183 parties to the Convention mulled 56 proposals that also extended protection for exotic amphibians and reptiles, which are increasingly popular as domestic pets.

“Although there is often less public awareness of the world’s continuing loss of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and smaller mammals, the survival of these species is essential for the fabric of life on Earth,” Ms. Higuero insisted.

“We must dedicate as much attention to such species as we do to high-value fish and timber and large, charismatic mammals.”

Among the decisions taken at the conference, CITES parties urged Mexico to use its navy to prevent fishing vessels from entering a refuge for vaquitas – a near-extinct porpoise.

Giraffe populations down to just tens of thousands

And in recognition that giraffes are at even greater risk than elephants, with populations declining to just “a couple of tens of thousands” owing to habitat and other pressures, the conference agreed that the world’s tallest animal is likely to be threatened with extinction unless its trade is strictly controlled.

Increased protection measures were voted through for Asia’s smooth-coated and small-clawed otters – which are now listed as threatened with extinction - amid habit loss and possible trade in live animals.

Under the new otter listing, all commercial trade in the two listed species is now prohibited.

Guitarfish trade restrictions increased amid hunt for prized fins

The conference also decided to extend protection measures for 18 more sharks including blacknose and sharpnose guitarfishes, which are highly valued for their fins and already considered endangered by many conservationists.

Shortfin and longfin mako sharks, together with white-spotted and other species of wedgefishes, were also given similar safeguards.

Elephant ivory trade ban remains in place

<a href=http://bit.ly/2m1m2TQ>UNEP GRID Arendal/Peter Prokosch</a> African bush elephants in the Maasai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Despite increased poaching in many parts of Africa, the elephant population in Mara is presently growing.

On the issue of elephants – whose population has fallen to “a couple of hundred thousand today” according to CITES, the conference rejected proposals to permit the limited trade in ivory from African elephants, meaning that the existing trade ban remains in place.

On rhinos, Parties agreed to increased quotas for trophy hunting of adult male black rhinos, almost doubling the current quota of five, subject to strict controls.

But proposed trade in southern white rhino horns from Eswatini (Swaziland) and live animals and hunting trophies from Namibia were rejected in a vote.

Wildlife sustainability through engagement with local and indigenous communities

Emphasizing the need for sustainability in wildlife management, CITES chief Ms. Higuero also noted the willingness of countries to “better engage” with local and indigenous people and to understand their need for adequate incomes and livelihoods.

More than 100 Parties to the Convention spoke on this topic alone, she noted, while underlining that these communities “live on the frontlines of wildlife conservation and sustainable management…without them, CITES will struggle to succeed”.

Illegal wildlife trade move online is ‘rapid’, better cooperation needed, says CITES chief

In a bid to tackle the illegal wildlife trade and its “rapid” move online, Ms. Higuero also welcomed the fact that the conference had focused on the subregions of West and Central Africa, in areas where there is trade in elephant ivory, pangolins, parrots and rosewood.

Another important decision was the decision to establish the CITES Big Cat Task Force, the CITES chief added, its aim being to tackle illegal trade and promote collaboration on conserving tigers, lions, cheetahs, jaguars and leopards.

Highlighting the recognition among countries that they should work more closely with international organizations tasked with tracking down illegal wildlife traders, Ms. Higuero gave the example of one successful enforcement operation that had involved 109 countries.

Codenamed “Operation Thunderball”, it had led to “over 1,800 seizures across all continents, and the arrest of close to 600 suspects."~[]

Forty five year old Sudan met his end at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, and is survived by only two more rhinos of his kind, both female. Unfortunately, neither of those ladies are fit to reproduce, as one suffers from uterine lesions that render her incapable and the other has hind legs that would make pregnancy a very chancy thing.

All was not lost, however.

According to Smithsonian, the species may be revived through the wonders of science. Recently veterinarians were able to successfully remove eggs from both Najin and Fatu, the last two remaining northern white rhinos. The surgery took two hours and was considered highly successful, since about ten oocytes were removed from the rhinos. Those eggs were airlifted to Italy and combined with sperm, which had previously been collected and frozen, from four different now-deceased white bull rhinos.

After the successful harvest of 10 eggs from the world’s last two northern white rhinos, Najin and Fatu, 7 eggs (4 from Fatu and 3 from Najin) were on August 25th, successfully matured and artificially inseminated with frozen sperm from northern white rhino bulls, Suni and Saut. pic.twitter.com/2xWsb2gvRn — Ol Pejeta (@OlPejeta) August 26, 2019

Later the fertilized embryos can be implanted in surrogate mothers from among the population of southern white rhinos, reviving the sub-species. This attempt to resurrect the northern white rhino was not an off-the-cuff maneuver, it’s been in the works for years.

According to a report from Nature in July, 2018, researchers were trying to revive the species back then, creating a hybrid which contained the DNA from the northern rhino variety and another sub-species which was closely related, in an attempt to stave of extinction.

Scientists successfully fertilize eggs from last existing northern white rhinos https://t.co/IkhJDNFhf6 pic.twitter.com/5FGUJvvidC — The Hill (@thehill) August 28, 2019

Even back then, scientists were practicing the egg-removal and fertilization techniques on other, less endangered, female rhinos so that they could perfect it without endangering the last two females of their kind. The eggs that they obtained were fertilized with the sperm of northern white rhinos, and of thirteen eggs that were fertilized, three developed into viable hybrid embryos.

Presently, scientists are hoping to duplicate the procedure with the eggs they obtained from Najin and Fatu, creating genetically pure embryos that can be implanted in surrogates and, after a 14 month wait, hopefully have new specimens of the norther variety once again.

Even this isn’t without risks, however. There’s no way to know for certain whether the southern rhino surrogates will be able to carry embryos of the other sub-species to term, or whether or not any resulting calves will be able to reproduce or will be born sterile. Even if neither of these two obstacles materialize, there’s still another issue. The available pool of sperm and eggs for the northern rhino is very small and all come from animals who are closely related, rendering the available gene pool even smaller.

There may be a way to work around that problem, too. Scientists are trying to create artificial eggs and sperm from the preserved skin of 12 other white rhinos. If they’re successful, that will help deepen the gene pool. What the final result of these experiments will ultimately be is still unknown, but reports say that preliminary steps seem hopeful.

All of the research is being done by the BioResuce Project, a new research consortium, with the idea that if their attempts are successful the technology can then be used to preserve other species which are on the verge of extinction. Frank Gortiz, the head vet at the Leibnitz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, commented that they are gaining critical information about the biology of reproduction and how it assist it, which can be a huge boon to other species, as well as the white rhino.

The northern white rhino is native to Uganda, Sudan, and some other parts of Africa. In 1960 it was reported that there were still 2,360 of their kind. Civil unrest and poaching had radically reduced their numbers by 1984, leaving only about 15. By 2003 the number of surviving white rhinos had been doubled thanks to careful rescue and conservation efforts, but within three more years, no more white rhinos were seen in the wild, thanks to poaching. The current efforts scientists are undertaking may well be the animals’ only hope."~[]

Ferdinand Magellan set foot on his historic circumnavigation of the globe.

Today, the island is home to open-pit mines that have been operating for decades to get valuable deposits of chromite and nickel.

Locals opposed to the mines now have a new weapon in their fight: a recent assessment of the island’s flora and fauna, showing that it houses threatened and endemic species, in particular the critically endangered Philippine cockatoo.

The regional environment department has recommended that in light of this finding, the entire island be declared a critical habitat, which would protect the identified species from mining and other activities.

GUIUAN, Philippines — The island of Homonhon in the Philippines’ Eastern Samar province cemented its place in history when the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan landed on its warm ochre shores in 1521 and named the island and the archipelago Las islas de San Lázaro. The site where he landed would later be named Lazaro Beach.

Magellan and his fleet spent nearly two weeks there recuperating and gathering food and water after an arduous Pacific crossing that had left dozens of the crew dead. Nearly 500 years since that fateful visit, the island has become a beacon once again, this time for miners drawn by its nickel and chromite deposits. The Philippines is one of the world’s top producers of nickel, and Eastern Samar contains one of the most substantial deposits of this prized mineral.

Since 1983, four mining companies have operated on the island, much to the chagrin of the locals.

Now, though, residents opposed to the open-pit mines have found a new reason to keep up the fight — one that could mean an end to all mining on the island.

The lowland forests still untouched by the mines are home to the Philippine cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia), an IUCN-listed critically endangered species endemic to the Philippines. The bird’s population in the wild is estimated at between 650 and 1,120, and commercial trade in wild-caught specimens is prohibited under CITES Appendix I.

In 2017, researchers from the Philippine Misereor Partnership Inc. (PMPI) and Visayas State University assessed Homonhon’s flora and fauna, compiling a list of the island’s threatened species, including the Philippine cockatoo.

Locals call the white birds abukay. They used to keep them as caged pets, valued for their ability to mimic human voices, but also resented the wild birds as pests, for snipping rice stalks.

There’s little of that resentment left these days, as evidenced by the locals’ response to the researchers’ findings. According to the PMPI, when the residents were presented with the results of the survey, those in the three barangays, or villages, of Inapulangan, Bitaugan and Habag started a petition to protect the abukay. They gathered signatures and submitted a petition to the barangay leaders, requesting that the three barangays be declared a critical habitat.

The regional environment agency took it a step further: it recommended that the whole island of Homonhon be designated a critical habitat.

This was after the agency, together with the head of the local government’s environment and natural resources office, conducted their own validation process and spotted six Philippine cockatoos in the barangay of Inapulangan alone.

The process also confirmed the presence of other endemic species on the island that are classified as endangered by the IUCN: the Visayan tarictic hornbill (Penelopides panini) and the giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus), also known as the golden-capped fruit bat.

Other birds found in the survey were the endemic guaiabero (Bolbopsittacus lunulatus), a parrot species known locally as bubutok; the hooded pitta (Pitta sordida); the bar-bellied cuckooshrike (Coracina striata); and the yellowish bulbul (Hypsipetes everetti), a songbird. There were also reported sightings by travelers of the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius syrichta), one of the world’s smallest primates.

“We recommended to declare the island as ‘critical habitat’ as soon as possible to preserve and protect Homonhon’s critically endangered and other vulnerable species, including other fauna which were also recorded in the area,” the regional environment agency said during a dialogue with the PMPI.

“It will take some time before it gets approved,” says Yoly Esguerra, PMPI national coordinator. “But the three barangays already have their respective resolutions and it is already in the municipal level.”

Philippine law defines critical habitats as those areas outside of protected zones that are proven to be home to threatened species. Critical habitats are designated as such through an order issued by the environment secretary and the local government unit.

Such an order would identify the species to be protected, create a management council to serve as the policymaking body, and ensure coordination between the central and local governments to protect the area from “any form of exploitation or destruction which may be detrimental to the survival of the threatened species.”

These areas of protection require population estimates and rapid habitat assessment, species-specific studies and an examination of human-related threats to wildlife. While protected areas require a national law, critical habitats can be declared by the environment department and the local government unit, making it a speedy and more efficient option in protecting vulnerable areas.

The most important aspect of declaring a critical habitat is the management: Protected areas are managed by the national environment department, while critical habitats are managed by local or municipal governments.

In practice, the declaration of critical habitats also take years especially if the local government has yet to create a management body. In Palawan, the Palawan Council for Sustainable Development (PCSD) took the initiative to declare critical habitats in Palawan on 2011 but the guidelines were only approved and adopted in 2013.

In 2016, the Philippines declared Cleopatra’s Needle, more than 40,500 hectares (100,000 acres), as critical habitats in a process that lasted for three years. In 2018, Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu wanted to declareareas in Boracay as critical habitats after the closure of the popular tourist island but the department has yet to pursue this option.

In Homonhon, locals have celebrated the possibility of their own island being designated a critical habitat. If it happens, it could mean a complete ban on mining activities on the island.

“The effort to declare should be urgent since the island is now under threat from different mining activities,” both operating and applying for permits, said Juderick Calumpiano, the PMPI co-convenor for Visayas and social action director of the Catholic diocese of Borongan.

New data gives insight into blue and fin whale behavior.

Researchers using electronic tags were able to monitor blue and fin whales off the coast of Southern California over multiple weeks, providing new insight into the feeding behaviors of the two largest whale species. The researchers also found evidence of differences in the feeding intensity and habitat use of males and females of both species.

“The information collected with these tags gives us a good description of the scale of whales’ feeding behavior over periods of hours, days and weeks, which is something we’ve not been able to do before,” said Ladd Irvine, a senior faculty research assistant in Oregon State University’s Marine Mammal Institute and the study’s lead author.

The whales fed mostly during the day, usually in short bursts lasting one to two hours, but would also feed continuously throughout the daytime, and in rare circumstances for an entire day.

“We were able to quantify feeding bouts, which are periods of uninterrupted feeding, and found that the duration of feeding bouts correlated with another measure of feeding success – the number of prey capture events, known as feeding lunges,” Irvine said. “That means the whales stayed longer in areas where they fed more. This allowed us to make inferences about the profitability of feeding patches, as whales should stay in an area and feed longer where prey is abundant and move on when prey becomes scarce.”

The findings, which were published this week in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution, could have implications for managing populations of blue and fin whales, both of which are listed as endangered in the United States.

In 2014 and 2015, researchers tagged eight blue and five fin whales off the coast of Point Mugu and San Miguel Island in Southern California. Both species frequent the area, feasting on krill.

Prior whale monitoring efforts had relied solely on location tracking, which tells researchers where the whales travel, but not what happens along the way. The tags used in this study, developed at Oregon State in collaboration with Wildlife Computers Inc., included GPS for movement monitoring as well as the ability to record information about the whales’ behavior every second while they were on the move. Accelerometers and other sensors on the tags measured lunge-feeding behavior as well as frequency and depth of dives.

“The hardest thing about studying whales is that you can’t really follow them when they dive below the surface” said Irvine, who is also a doctoral student in the OSU College of Agricultural Sciences’ Department of Fisheries and Wildlife. “The data collected from these tags give us unprecedented detail about what whales are doing over a longer time period than was previously possible.”

Tags remained on the blue whales an average of 22 days and on the fin whales about 14 days. It’s unclear why the tags came off the fin whales more quickly, but it could have to do with their movement and faster speed in the water, Irvine said.

The researchers found that both species of whales had similar feeding bout characteristics. During an average feeding bout, blue whales made 24 dives over a period of about 3.3 hours, while fin whales made 19 dives over 2.7 hours. The similarities are not surprising, the researchers said, as the two species are similar in size and feed in the same way. Slight differences observed may be due to preferences in terms of patch characteristics or prey type.

“This study represents a significant leap forward in our knowledge of whale foraging ecology,” said Daniel Palacios, who holds the Endowed Faculty in Whale Habitats position at the Marine Mammal Institute and is a co-author of the paper.

“By collecting data from individual whales over multiple days and weeks, we were able to obtain large amounts of new information about how feeding intensity evolves and changes in time and space, at scales that are relevant to ecology as well as management,” he said. “We were able to answer questions like how long does a whale feed? What is the size of a feeding patch? How far does a whale need to move before it finds the next patch? Do females and males feed at the same intensity? It may seem surprising, but studying whales is enormously challenging and we lacked much of this information.”

But feeding might not be the only thing on the whales’ minds, as the researchers also found differences in movements between tagged males and females of both species.

“The males made big loops offshore of Southern California, while the females stuck closer to shore. Those routes may be related somehow to breeding behavior, and could have implications in terms of exposure to human activities if whales of one sex are more likely to be encountered in specific parts of busy Southern California waters,” Irvine said.

“While the results are exciting, our conclusions about the behaviors of whales from this initial set of data from 13 animals should be viewed as preliminary,” he said. “These data are an incredibly rich description of the tagged whales’ behavior, but they ultimately represent a relatively small number of individuals, occupying a portion of their overall range.”

Ideally, similar data would be collected again from different locations or different whales to determine if the observed feeding and other behavior patterns are representative of the broader populations, he said.

“Nevertheless, this information is a huge addition to our understanding of blue and fin whale feeding ecology,” Irvine said. “Does what we saw with these individuals hold up as we continue to study them in other places and seasons? That’s a question still to be determined. We’re still just scratching the surface of our understanding of whale behavior.”

Here, Najin recovers after her eggs are collected, while Fatu (Najin’s daughter) undergoes the same procedure in another enclosure.

Just two northern white rhinoceroses exist in the world. Now, though, this critically endangered subspecies has a new, slim chance at survival: two lab-created embryos that could grow to maturity, according to an announcement made Wednesday (Sept.11).

The international team of researchers has been working to save the northern white rhino (Ceratotherium simum cottoni) for years using in-vitro fertilization. Now that researchers have successfully fertilized two of these eggs, the next step would be to implant the lab-created embryos in the uteruses of members of a closely related subspecies, the southern white rhino.

""The entire team has been developing and planning these procedures for years ,"" Thomas Hildebrandt, a biologist from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, said in a statement. ""Today, we achieved an important milestone on a rocky road which allows us to plan the future steps in the rescue program of the northern white rhino.""

Last of their kind

The northern white rhinoceros likely went extinct in the wild in 2007 or 2008. Though a small number of the animals survived in zoos, most of the living individuals were aging or had health problems that precluded them carrying young. In 2018, the last male northern white rhino , Sudan, died, leaving only two members of the species, both female, alive.

The new embryos count those two living rhinos as their mothers. The maternal rhinos, Najin and Fatu, were both born at Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic and now live at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Neither will be able to carry their embryos to term. Najin is too old, and Fatu has uterine problems that make pregnancy impossible.

But in late August, scientists successfully harvested eggs from both female rhinos. The researchers then used a procedure called intra cytoplasm sperm injection to fertilize the eggs with frozen sperm from two northern white rhino males named Suni and Saut. Suni died in 2014, and Saut died in 2006.

Of the 10 eggs harvested, seven were suitable for fertilization, according to one of the researchers involved, Cesare Galli, of Avantea Laboratories in Cremona, Italy. Ultimately, only two matured into viable embryos. Both of those were created with Fatu's eggs and Suni's sperm. The embryos have now been frozen to preserve them for future transfer.

Saving a subspecies

To bring the embryos to term, scientists still have to perfect the art of embryo transfer in rhinos. Researchers will also have to find a healthy southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum) or two to carry the pregnancy.

""Five years ago, it seemed like the production of a northern white rhino embryo was [an] almost unachievable goal — and today we have them. This fantastic achievement of the whole team allows us to be optimistic regarding our next steps,"" Jan Stejskal, the director of communications and international projects at the zoo where Najin and Fatu were born, said in the statement.

To truly bring back the northern white, though, will take more than a few successful rounds of in vitro fertilization. Scientists have only two living reservoirs for eggs and have stored sperm from only four northern white rhinoceros bulls. That leaves little genetic diversity for resurrecting the species . But tissue banks do have nongamete tissues (meaning any tissue except the sperm and egg) stored from other northern whites, which would expand the gene pool to 12 rhinos. Researchers are now working on stem cell technology to transform these regular tissue samples into sperm and eggs."~[]

Extinction is silent, like sand sliding through an hourglass; we barely notice it until it’s too late and have lost what will never return. If someone were to tell us that the only living specimens of a mammal were two females, we would think the species is doomed. How can it survive if it has exhausted the natural possibility of reproducing itself?

The documents show that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service issued a permit in May for hunter, Carl Atkinson, to bring home the lion trophy which was taken from a game preserve in July or August, according to Courthouse News. The hunter's attorney, John Jackson III, is a member of the Interior Department's own International Wildlife Conservation Council, which Ryan Zinke created as Secretary of the Interior to highlight the ""economic benefits that result from US citizens traveling to foreign nations to engage in hunting,"" as CNN reported.

""This is tragic news for lion conservation, and it suggests that the Trump administration may soon open the floodgates to trophy imports from Tanzania,"" said Tanya Sanerib, international legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, in a statement. ""Tanzania is a lion stronghold, but it's been criticized by scientists for corruption and inadequate wildlife protections. Opening the U.S. market to these imports doesn't bode well for the lion kings of Tanzania."" Tanzania is thought to be home to 40 percent of Africa's lions, though exact populations are difficult to count. It has a history of mismanaging populations of lions, elephants and other threatened animals. By allowing hunters to bring their trophies back to the U.S. there are ripple effects. Hunters often seek out mature male lions, which make desirable trophies. Yet, killing one lion often leads to the death of many more. Since those mature male lions are usually pack leaders, a new pack leader will move in and assert dominance by killing the hunted lion's offspring, resulting in the loss of many lions, as the Center for Biological Diversity noted. There is no evidence in the acquired documents acquired that the Fish and Wildlife Service considered this in assessing Atkinson's permit application. However, Sanerib said the occurrence is so well-documented that she has absolute faith the agency is aware that the import authorization results in the death of more than just one lion. The outcome is not only harmful because of the death of additional lions but because it diminishes the genetic pool, she said, as Courthouse News reported."~['US']

permission to wander India’s protected forests on foot, following the same trails the big cats tread. While she enjoys coming across tigers and their cubs and watching them with binoculars, those sightings aren’t the treasure she’s after. What she loves most is to find tiger droppings — “almost like gold to me,” says the molecular ecologist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore.

Territorial tigers oblige by leaving scat regularly, as a warning to other tigers that this space is occupied. These nuggets contain genetic material that scientists like Ramakrishnan use to understand tiger populations: How many are there, and what kinds? Where did they come from, and how far do they travel?

It’s crucial information for conservation efforts. Tigers are endangered, with fewer than 4,000 wild ones roaming the lands of at least 10 nations, from Eastern Russia to the island of Sumatra. That’s down from an estimate of 100,000 in 1900. Human activity such as urban development, logging, farming and mining has fragmented and destroyed tigers’ forest habitats, and poaching is an ongoing problem in parts of Southeast Asia.

“If you’re going to have conservation management, you have to know what you’re dealing with,” says Stephen O’Brien, a geneticist at St. Petersburg State University in Russia and Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. For example, genetic studies show that tigers are split into several subspecies, so conservationists may want to develop strategies to protect each group.

Over the past two decades, scientists have built up a picture of tiger evolution and ecology based on their DNA, as described this year in the Annual Review of Animal Biosciences. Early on, scientists could only look at a handful of spots in the tiger genome. Today, with the advent of inexpensive DNA sequencing and genomics that covers every bit of the instructions to make a tiger, experts are gaining a much broader picture of tiger biodiversity.

DNA analysis — which will help not just to save tigers, but also to preserve the range of genetic variety that they carry — “is one of the best tools we have,” says Byron Weckworth, conservation genetics director for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization in Missoula, Montana. That said, he adds, the application of genomic information to conservation is still in its infancy.

Here are some of the key questions that tiger genomes can answer.

How many tigers are there?

The nature of wild tigers — solitary, well-camouflaged and rare — makes it difficult to conduct a census. To that end, Ramakrishnan evaluated the potential of genetics to count tigers for a 2009 study in Biological Conservation. She and her colleagues collected 68 samples of tiger dung from Bandipur Tiger Reserve and National Park in the south of India, preserving them in alcohol. Back in the lab, they isolated the DNA inside to examine the genetic sequences — the strings of letters A, C, G and T — of certain parts of the tiger genome.

If a genome is like a book, most of the words will be identical from tiger to tiger. What geneticists look for are the places where the words can differ. Specifically, Ramakrishnan and colleagues analyzed places where the tiger genome repeats itself, and stutters — say, GATA-GATA-GATA-GATA-GATA. No two tigers have the same number of repeats at each spot, so scientists can use the differing counts to distinguish individuals.

The researchers got high-quality data from 38 of their scat samples, and together these represented 26 individuals. That is, some tigers had left Ramakrishnan multiple presents. By number-crunching the tigers appearing once or multiple times in these samples, she estimated that there were 66 tigers in the area.

Ramakrishnan updated the technique in an April 2019 study, this time using modern technology to read every letter in the genomes of 75 wild and captive tiger samples. Her team tested for even subtler genetic changes than the numbers of repeats, homing in on variations in the spellings of individual words — say, a place that had a CAA instead of a CAT. From this, the researchers devised a panel of 126 spelling variations that help to identify individuals, reporting their work in Methods in Ecology and Evolution.

The new test is fast, easy and inexpensive, Ramakrishnan says. She hopes that it will make tiger-typing (and tiger-counting) accessible to scientists in all nations that host the creatures. That’s important because, due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), researchers cannot send any tiger samples across borders.

What kinds of tigers are there?

Tigers are known as Panthera tigris to scientists, but there’s more to it than that. They can be divided into subspecies: groups that are isolated and might, over time, develop into new species, O’Brien says.

“It’s better to save tigers as a whole, but in doing that, we should be saving the subspecies wherever we can,” says John Goodrich, tiger program senior director and chief scientist for Panthera in Fort Collins, Colorado. Plus, Goodrich notes, regional governments are more likely to fund tiger conservation if they have a flagship subspecies of their own.

But how many subspecies are there to save? Estimates have ranged from just two to as many as nine (of which three are already extinct). Genomics can help.

Geneticist Shu-Jin Luo at Peking University in Beijing and colleagues sequenced the genomes of 32 samples of tiger blood and tissue. When they compared the millions of differing genetic spellings and built a tiger family tree, they found that living tigers fell into six distinct groups, described in a 2018 paper in Current Biology: Bengal tigers in India, Amur tigers in Eastern Russia, and South China, Sumatran, Indochinese and Malayan varieties.

“It has major implications on how we do conservation,” says study coauthor Dale Miquelle, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Russia program and coordinator for the society’s tiger projects. For example, zoos breed animals to keep subspecies bloodlines pure. One day, says Miquelle, conservationists might return some of those animals to the wild, infusing natural tiger populations with diverse genes that exist only in captives today.

In places where tigers roam no more, it might be feasible to introduce animals that genomics identify as most related to the extinct populations, suggests O’Brien, also a coauthor of the study. For example, Amur tigers are a close match for the extinct Caspian subspecies.

How have tigers changed over time?

Fossils indicate that tigers roamed China and Java 2 million years ago. Based on their tiger family tree, Luo’s group predicts that between 1 million and 110,000 years ago, tiger populations contracted into a small group, located in modern-day China and Southeast Asia. This was probably the result of the cool climate at the time, a feature of the Earth’s most recent ice age.

From this small group sprang all modern tigers, which spread across much of Asia. They developed genes best suited to their lifestyles in locales ranging from the tropics to the tundra.

For example, Sumatran tigers are smaller than others. They range from 165 to 308 pounds, compared to about 550 for Bengals, the biggest subspecies. Miniaturization is a common island adaptation for large animals, says Yue-Chen Liu, a geneticist who recently earned a PhD in Luo’s lab and plans to start work at Harvard University soon. Tigers may have encountered smaller prey when they reached the island of Sumatra, and through evolution, shrank to match.

Size is controlled by many genes, so Liu was surprised to find one in particular that might control Sumatran tigers’ size. The animals differ from other tigers in a gene for a protein — called ADH7 — that affects metabolism. Mice with mutations in this gene are small; the same might have happened in the tigers.

It’s just this kind of genetic diversity that conservationists ought to protect, says Liu.

Where does poached or illegally traded tiger material come from?

These endangered beasts are victims of their own majesty, as practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe their body parts are powerful restoratives, and others purchase the gorgeous pelts for decoration. One estimate valued the tiger-poaching industry at $19 billion per year. Unpermitted transport of tigers or their parts from one country to another is a crime, so identifying the source of the material can help prosecutors.

Luo’s group developed a test they call tigrisPlex. It uses 22 genetic repeat sequences to identify tiger subspecies and individuals. Reporting in the journal Integrative Zoology in 2015, they used the test to identify 12 confiscated skin or muscle specimens as being from six Amur tigers.

TigrisPlex can also help zoos maintain subspecies. In 2013, Luo got a call from a zoo in Osaka, Japan. The zoo was thinking of importing a tiger cub from China, but wanted to pick one that would be a good fit for the Amur tiger population they already had. Luo confirmed that the cub was an Amur, and that tiger is now living — happily, Luo is told — in Osaka.

How do tigers travel?

Since tigers maintain solitary territories, young animals leaving their mothers must find a new place to live. Individual tigers may travel more than 600 miles.

That’s difficult if tigers live mainly in protected parks, and human towns or roads get in the way of migration between their havens. To study tiger transit, Ramakrishnan’s group collected 289 tiger scat samples from 11 Indian parks, as well as areas beyond the parks. These samples represented 116 individuals.

Based on the DNA in the scat, the researchers found that tiger populations were less likely to mix when separated by roads, human settlements or nonwild areas such as pastures. Reporting in the journal Biological Conservation in 2018, they used computer models to predict what might happen to tiger populations under this kind of isolation, and it wasn’t good: Tigers would become less diverse, and the smallest populations were likely to disappear.

Conservationists are trying to stop that from happening. For example, the National Highways Authority of India recently expanded National Highway 7, which runs between Pench Tiger Reserve and Kanha Tiger Reserve in the middle of India, from two to four lanes. Environmentalists used Ramakrishnan’s data to argue that tigers need safe crossings.

The Highways Authority ended up constructing underpasses. And there’s evidence that tigers do use them: Early in the morning of February 23, 2019, a camera trap in one underpass outside the Pench Reserve caught a tiger strolling by.

What will become of tigers?

Genomicists hope that their data will be used to perform a sort of conservation triage, identifying the subspecies and populations most in need of help, or most likely to survive with assistance.

Today, the outlook is mixed for tigers, Goodrich says. They are doing well in southern Asia, and likely in the northeast, though he doesn’t have good population estimates for eastern Russia. In Southeast Asia, poaching remains a huge problem. And climate change is causing droughts and rising waters, further endangering tiger habitats, he adds.

Miquelle is optimistic about tigers’ long-term prospects. He hopes that as human populations stabilize and people move from the countryside to cities, there will be more room for wild things like tigers.

“One hundred years from now, there could be many more tigers in Asia than there are today,” he says. “There may be light at the end of the tunnel.”"~[]

five rhinoceros species, and to reflect on the challenges facing them.

The year that has elapsed since World Rhino Day 2018 has been a eventful one for rhino conservation.

Here, we look back at Mongabay’s coverage of some of the biggest stories from both Africa and Asia.

September 22 marks World Rhino Day, a global event established to celebrate the world’s five rhinoceros species, as well as to reflect on the challenges facing them.

Of the five rhino species living in Africa and Asia, three are listed by the IUCN as Critically Endangered: Javan Rhinos (Rhinoceros sondaicus), Sumatran rhinos (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) and black rhinos (Diceros bicornis). Meanwhile, White rhinos (Ceratotherium simum) are considered near threatened, and greater one-horned rhinos (Rhinoceros unicornis) vulnerable to extinction.

The year that has elapsed since World Rhino Day 2018 has been a momentous one for rhinos and for the people working to protect them. Regardless of its conservation status, each species faces dangers ranging from poaching to tsunamis to overcrowding in protected areas. But it’s not all bad news, with conservation efforts sparking an upturn in numbers for several species and subspecies. Even in the most seemingly desperate cases, small victories can be found, such as the relaunch of a captive breeding program in Sumatra.

Here, we look back at Mongabay’s coverage of some of the biggest stories.

China rescinds, then reinstates, rhino horn ban

The Chinese government announced on Oct. 29, 2018 that it had legalized the “controlled” use of rhino horn and tiger bone for medical use and cultural purposes in the country. Under the new regulations, rhino horn and tiger bone from farmed animals would be allowed to be used for medicinal purposes, overturning a ban put in place in 1993.

Conservationists were alarmed. Even with a ban, black-market demand for rhino and tiger products remains high in China. Experts feared legalizing the trade would legitimize the use of such products and create an opportunity for illegally-procured animal parts to be laundered into the market. “With wild tiger and rhino populations at such low levels and facing numerous threats, legalized trade in their parts is simply too great a gamble for China to take,” the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said.

On Nov. 12, the government backtracked, saying it would maintain the ban while further studies are conducted. Wildlife activists expressed relief, but remain watchful.

New Sumatran rhino captive breeding effort gets underway

On Sept. 20, 2018 — just ahead of World Rhino Day — a coalition of international conservation organizations announced the official launch of Sumatran Rhino Rescue, an effort to support the Indonesian government’s captive breeding program for the Critically Endangered species. In the year since, a number of significant steps have been taken. Key among these was the successful Nov. 25 capture of a female Sumatran Rhino in Indonesian Borneo. The rhino, named Pahu, is the first new rhino added the breeding program since its relaunch as Sumatran Rhino Rescue.

Plans are also underway to build a network of sanctuaries where rhinos can be cared for and — researchers hope — breed, in a setting closely resembling their natural habitat. In addition to the existing facility in Way Kambas National Park where seven rhinos live, and the new center in Kalimantan where Pahu is living, the government has announced plans to open a sanctuary in the Leuser Ecosystem in northern Sumatra.

The May 2019 death of Tam, the last male rhino known to survive in Malaysia, added urgency to the call to intensify captive breeding efforts. Only nine Sumatran rhinos currently live captivity, and the wild population is believed to number no more than 80.

Tsunami hits Javan rhino habitat

On Dec. 22, 2018, a devastating tsunami hit Indonesia’s Java Island, killing more than 400 people. The tsunami generated waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high, some of which crashed ashore in Ujung Kulon National Park, the sole remaining habitat of the Javan rhino. Two park employees were killed and guard posts damaged, but no rhinos are believed to have been harmed. Park officials credit the rhinos’ survival at least partly to the animals’ natural instinct to seek high ground.

Conservationists have long warned that having the entire remaining Javan rhino population — currently estimated at 68 individuals — confined to a single habitat leaves the species highly vulnerable extinction due to natural disaster or disease.

Despite these warnings, Indonesian officials announced in July that plans to establish a second habitat for the species have been put on hold. Instead, efforts will concentrate on expanding the available habitat in and around Ujung Kulon.

Reckoning with success in Nepal

Nepal has enjoyed extraordinary success at boosting the population of its greater one-horned rhinos. But this past year brought a reckoning. In March 2019, a Buzzfeed investigation revealed cases of alleged human rights violations around Chitwan National Park, highlighting how sweeping legal powers bestowed upon park rangers can negatively affect the lives of people living around protected areas.

Meanwhile, another problem is becoming apparent in Chitwan, the country’s main rhino sanctuary. Although poaching has been virtually eliminated, rhinos have not stopped dying. Instead, out of a population of around 600 rhinos, more than 45 have been found dead due to unexplained or natural causes since July 2018. The spike in unexplained deaths has led some to speculate that Chitwan has reached its carrying capacity for the species.

Black rhinos get new homes

Efforts to reintroduce black rhinos to areas in which previous populations were wiped out by conflict or poaching have met with mixed success. In the wake of a botched 2018 translocation Kenya, where all 11 relocated animals died, Chad also faced a major setback. Six black rhinos were translocated from South Africa to Chad’s Zakouma National Park in May 2018. By November 2018, four had died.

In Rwanda, however, five eastern black rhinos (D. b. michaeli) were reported in August to have successfully completed an initial acclimatization period after being relocated from European zoos to Akagera National Park. They join with a herd of 20 who in 2017 were brought to the park from South Africa. Conservation efforts helped bring black rhino numbers from below 2,500 in the 1990s to more than 5,000 today, and despite the challenges, efforts are ongoing to reintroduce the species across its former range.

You’d think that having a huge weapon right on your face would be an obvious instrument for battle, but some rhinos actually use their teeth when they need to in a fight. The three Asian species (Sumatran, Javan, and Indian) use their lower outer incisor teeth instead of their horns. The teeth of Indian rhinoceroses can reach 5 inches in length, leaving a nasty mark if used to fight off other rhinos or predators. But the African species (the Black rhino and the White rhino) don’t have these long incisors and do fight with their horns.

More than a hundred zoos and organizations across the world, such as Sequoia Park Zoo in Eureka, celebrated International Red Panda Day on Saturday, offering free admission and a host of activities to raise awareness about the sleepy tree-dwellers.

Eureka resident Anthony Baccello was among the hundreds of red panda enthusiasts that passed through the zoo, but said he comes to the zoo regularly. Baccello said it was important to plan to come around 4 p.m. when the red pandas are getting fed, “otherwise they’re napping for the most part.”

Douglas Nielsen moved to the area from New York and was seeing the zoo for the first time. The red pandas were still sleeping when he was by the red panda enclosure, but was able to catch a quick glimpse of one eating some bamboo before going back to sleep.

“He looks healthy,” Nielsen said.

Neilsen said he liked the fact that the fact that the animals weren’t kept in the cages you usually find at the zoo.

“I thought it would be the usual caged monkeys and the giraffe,” Nielsen said. “That’s just really sad … . It’s nice to see them in a somewhat natural habitat.”

The fact that admission was free for the day was a big draw for a lot of families that came out for the event.

“It was free, it’s a beautiful day and we love to come to the zoo,” said Shawnti Reed, who brought her son Moses earlier in the day. They weren’t able to see the red pandas, but Reed said her son really loves the petting zoo.

As far as a favorite animal goes, Moses said he liked the eagles.

Alicia Krueger, an Arcata resident, brought her daughter to the zoo for the free admission and said they both liked the aviary more than anything else.

“I like the African greys,” Krueger said, referring to the African grey parrot. “And the petting zoo is fun.”

Frankie the pig at the petting zoo is a big draw, too, Krueger said.

Tony Clark and Desi Sanders were raised in the area and brought their son Barnaby, 4, to the zoo, which Clark said he’s been frequenting most of his life.

“It’s a lot different than it was then,” Clark said. “They’ve done a lot for the place.”"~[]

A portion of the proceeds from each pint and bottle sold will be donated to the Oregon Zoo Foundation, which supports the zoo’s wildlife conservation efforts. Red pandas, a mammal with reddish-brown fur and a shaggy tail, are native to the eastern Himalayas, specifically places like China and Nepal. These adorable, unique and endangered animals are tree-dwellers and excellent climbers. According to estimates, there are fewer than 5,000 wild mature red pandas due to habitat loss from deforestation.

“The red panda population has been disappearing at an alarming rate over the past 20 years,” noted Dr. Don Moore, Oregon Zoo director. “Partnering with Rogue Ales & Spirits is helping us spread the word to make sure the red panda and other endangered species are around for future generations.”

“We at Rogue are committed to giving back to our community, which includes the people and animals,” says Rogue President Dharma Tamm. “We are proud of our continual partnership with the Oregon Zoo and will do whatever we can to help support the amazing work they do for animal preservation.”

Red Panda IPA is available on draft at the Oregon Zoo, at Rogue pubs and in 22 oz. bottles at select retailers.

The series is the product of a monthslong investigation conducted by Sixth Tone in collaboration with its sister publication The Paper. The first feature in the series can be read here.

JILIN, Northeast China — Tigers are costing Zheng Hailun a fortune. The 64-year-old rents acres of pastureland on China’s northeastern border to graze his cattle, but these days he can rarely use it. He keeps his cows locked up for most of the year, spending around $25,000 on extra feed.

Zheng is not doing this to protect his animals from big cats; rather, it’s the other way around. He is one of thousands of farmers in northeastern China forced to remove their cattle from the mountains to preserve the habitats of China’s few remaining Siberian tigers.

Siberian tigers are native to Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, which border Russia and North Korea, but the species is critically endangered. Years of human encroachment has divided their hunting grounds and cut them off from tiger populations in the Russian Far East.

The Chinese government has stepped up conservation efforts to prevent the extinction of the felines, and in 2016 it announced plans to create a new national park — the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park — covering swathes of Jilin and Heilongjiang.

Within months, officials in Zheng’s hometown of Hunchun, which is within the boundaries of the park, banned farmers from grazing cattle on local mountainsides. In 2018, they introduced further rules requiring all cattle to be kept inside cowsheds between April and October each year. Anyone found allowing their animals to graze freely would be fined 500 yuan ($70) per cow.

The ban is designed to create more grazing areas for wild red deer and Sika deer — the main prey of Siberian tigers and Amur leopards — as well as prevent herders and cattle from disturbing the cats’ natural sleeping habits. But it has provoked pushback from locals, who say the rules are having a huge impact on their livelihoods.

According to Zheng, the extra costs from keeping his animals inside swallow almost all the income he can make from selling cattle. “The main loss is from the feed,” says Zheng. “A cow eats 300 yuan of feed every month, so for 100 cattle that’s 180,000 yuan over six months.”

Zheng used to simply ride his motorcycle to the pastures every other day to check on his herd, but he now spends almost all day feeding the cows and mucking out the pen. He has quickly become the busiest person in his village, unable to pursue any side ventures to supplement his income.

By the winter of 2018, the financial pressure on Hunchun’s farmers had become so great, many started selling off their animals. Zheng reduced his herd by 30, leaving around 70. He can’t bring himself to sell any more — after all, he has invested nearly 3 million yuan on cattle farming over the years.

The herders find it hard to understand why the government has suddenly restricted their industry, despite generously supporting it before. Several have released their cattle back onto the hills. According to Zheng, no one has ever been fined.

Gao Dabin, a director at the Hunchun branch of the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Parks Administration, says local officials feel helpless. “Of course this work is harmful to the interests of villagers — the problem has not been thoroughly solved,” says Gao. “It needs to be solved step by step.”

But the problems could soon become more severe. In 2018, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration released a plan to roll out further conservation methods inside the Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. It says that free grazing will eventually be restricted on 95% of the land inside the park, affecting more than 60,000 cattle.

What’s more, Gao adds, restrictions on other activities will gradually be introduced one after the other — including frog farming, gathering wild vegetables, and mining, among others — all of which will impact the local economy.

For the 93,000 people living inside the park, the new rules represent the latest in a series of policies threatening their traditional way of life. Bans on hunting and logging introduced in the ’90s cut off large sources of income, leading many to seek their fortunes in nearby cities or even in South Korea. Of those left behind, those in their 40s are considered young, and most do not even have a junior high school education.

Conservation researchers argue that it should be possible for the villagers and tigers to coexist inside the national park if the government creates detailed and focused policy objectives.

Jiang Guangshun, deputy director of the Feline Research Center at Northeast Forestry University, says that efforts should concentrate on allowing China’s Siberian tigers to link up with larger cat populations in Russia. “It is very important to open up the international ecological corridor,” says Jiang.

Yet government policy documents suggest no such detailed planning is yet in place. Around four-fifths of the land in Hunchun is currently included in the proposed conservation project. If these proposals are implemented, they would severely impact traditional ways of life in the region.

A number of researchers have proposed amendments to the zoning plans, reporters have learned, but it is still unclear whether these changes have been put into effect. Zhu Chunquan, China’s representative for the International Union for Conservation of Nature, says the plan needs to be more detailed.

“The zoning should be specific to each village and each hill, clarifying which are habitats and ecological corridors,” says Zhu. “It shouldn’t just be a big circle.”

“Priority should be given to protecting habitats and diffusion routes that are higher quality,” says Gu Jiayin, one of Jiang’s colleagues at Northeast Forestry University. “Tigers are very smart and will not run to places with poor habitats.”

Researchers are keen to begin work on a more detailed protection plan. According to Wu Jingcai, a researcher at the Jilin Forestry Research Institute, there is still a lack of basic knowledge about how human activity impacts wildlife in China.

The Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park Administration told reporters that its main priority remains protecting the tigers and leopards’ habitats, and that several policies are still being formulated. But the park plans to support local residents in moving toward more eco-friendly farming methods and opening family guesthouses and other tourist venues.

Jiang says that Hunchun may not be able to rely on the mountains as much as before, but cultural tourism and other activities that have less environmental impact than cattle-farming can help make up for this loss of income. His examples include beekeeping, fruit-gathering, and cultural exhibitions highlighting the region’s Korean heritage.

“It’s not easy for the community to understand the value of protecting the Siberian tiger, because that means changing their own lives,” says Fan Zhiyong, chief scientist at the World Wide Fund for Nature. “Don’t be too hard on them.”

IDAHO FALLS — On Tuesday, the two-year-old African lion sisters, Kamaria and Ilanga, will begin a new life adventure as they move on to become part of the pride at Seattle’s Woodland Park Zoo.

“While we’ll miss them, we always knew the day would come when some members of our lion family would leave our zoo,” General Curator Darrell Markum said.

In only 30 years, wild African lion numbers have declined a startling 40 percent. The transfer of the sisters is an example of the important role Idaho Falls Zoo, as an accredited member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), plays in both local and global conservation efforts to save threatened and endangered species through a program known as the Species Survival Plan (SSP).

The Species Survival Plan is comprised of a scientific committee responsible for ensuring the genes of the captive populations, such as the African lions, stay diverse and healthy for generations to come. As part of the program, animals often move from their natal zoo to other accredited institutions in a scientific match-making effort. By regulating breeding, scientists can help ensure lions under human care are being properly managed to prevent the extinction of the species.

For now, Hondo, the young male lion born at the zoo in 2017, will remain at the Idaho Falls Zoo with his mother, Kimani. At 17 years old, Kimani is passed breeding age. The average lion expectancy of a captive lion is 15-20 years. The tentative plan is when Kimani passes, the SSP will assign the Idaho Falls Zoo a new mate (or mates as lions are social) to join Hondo.

Toma was the oldest living male Amur tiger in human care and had previously survived cancer treatment, the Syracuse zoo said.

Toma is survived by his mate, Tatiana, a nearly 20-year-old Amur tiger. The pair had triplet cubs at the zoo in 2011 as part of the species survival plan for their “critically endangered species,” according to the Facebook post. The three cubs were sent to zoos in South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, respectively, as part of the plan.

On Wednesday, Sept. 18, Toma showed increasing signs of severe abdominal pain, according to the zoo. A veterinary team from the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine that practices at the zoo was quickly mobilized, anesthetizing and examining the tiger. Test results suggested peritonitis and a perforation of the GI tract, according to the Facebook post. Due to the severity of his condition, zoo animal-care specialists and the Cornell vet team decided to “humanely euthanize him.”

Results from a necropsy confirmed that Toma had “a perforation of the small intestine directly associated with a large mass suspected to be cancer,” the zoo said.

Formerly called Siberian tigers, Amur tigers once ranged throughout Siberia but now inhabit only the Amur River basin in Far East Russia, the zoo explained. The largest species of wild cat, their population has been “decimated by human poaching and habitat loss,” leaving fewer than 400 of the tigers estimated to remain in the wild.

Ted Fox, Rosamond Gifford Zoo director, said the zoo will acquire another pair of Amur tigers and continue to participate in the species survival plan in the future.

peregrine always rarest raptor wisconsin much midwest belief population continue increase “as long environmental steward continue provide maintain nest site them”~"Last June, two peregrine falcons hatched on the top of Gruenhagen Conference Center at UW Oshkosh in an effort to help increase the falcon population in Wisconsin.

The two falcons were named Foxy and Fondy in tribute to the additions of the access campuses, UWO-Fond du Lac and UWO-Fox Cities, based on name suggestions from the UWO campus community.

They received leg bands from conservationists and biologist Greg Septon, the founder of the Wisconsin Peregrine Falcon Recovery Project. Septon uses the leg bands to help keep track of the raptors’ population in the state.

Peregrines are the fastest animals on the planet, capable of reaching speeds of 200 mph when diving, making it possible for them to kill prey just from the impact of the dive. They’re aerial predators at the top of the food chain due to their precise eyesight.

In 1970, peregrine falcons were put on the endangered species list due to prolonged use of a pesticide called DDT. Because the raptors are top predators, they ingest DDT through their prey.

Septon said DDT caused the eggshells of peregrine falcons to thin, which would prevent offspring from developing. DDT was banned in 1972, and since then the falcon population has been increasing.

Septon said although peregrine falcon populations have been increasing, they are still greatly endangered in the Midwest.

“Out of only 37 successful nests this year in Wisconsin, only six were on natural cliffs,” Septon said. “The remaining 31 pairs all nested on the human-built structures where humans provide and maintain nest boxes for them.”

Septon’s project aims to restore native bird species that are endangered by building and maintaining nest boxes for the raptors while also getting the public interested in peregrine falcons.

Septon also tracked Foxy and Fondy’s parents. He said their mother, Julia, was found injured in Chicago in 2011 and was nursed back to health and released into the wild with a tracking band.

In 2015, Septon identified Julia near the Wisconsin River bridge where she had attempted to build a nest and failed.

The baby peregrines’ father, Gaylord, hatched at the UW-Green Bay Cofrin Library nest site in 2016 and has been nesting at Gruenhagen since 2018, Septon said.

He added peregrines tend to build their nests in very tall trees, but when they are not in an area where this is an option, they tend to be attracted to tall human-built structures.

Because Gruenhagen already had a nest box built for them, Julia and Gaylord chose that location for their nest.

Between May 10-11, Julia and Gaylord’s eggs hatched. Septon said he put a tracking bands on each falcon’s leg on June 1.

Septon said the tracking bands “allow us to follow them through their lives and document survival, fatalities, injuries, longevity, production and dispersal distances.”

Septon said the falcons are only monitored by identifying leg band numbers “either by spotting scopes, cameras and webcams, which means we currently don’t know where they are.”

However, Septon said not knowing where the falcons are located is somewhat of a positive sign because it means they haven’t been reported dead or injured.

“First-year mortality for peregrines is between 50 to 70%, so a good portion of the young produced each year are lost,” he said.

Septon said peregrines have always been the rarest raptor in Wisconsin and much of the Midwest, but he believes populations will continue to increase “as long as we, as environmental stewards, continue to provide and maintain nest sites for them.”"~[]

It's been a work in progress for almost a year, but finally the lions at Chester Zoo have moved into their brand new home.

And what an impressive home it is too.

Opening to the public for the first time tomorrow (Friday, October 18), visitors will be able to get up close and personal with the lions like never before, in a brand new 4, 790 sq m habitat that has been inspired by the dry forest and savannah habitats of Gir National Park in India, where the last few hundred Asiatic lions live in the wild.

Getting a sneak peek of the sprawling new £2.8m habitat before its official opening day was a real privilege to say the least.

We got to meet lionesses Kumari and Kiburi, as well as adult male Iblis, who have been exploring their sprawling new home for the last four days.

Seeing other people so close up with just a thick plastic partition between us is still quite a new experience for them, so as the first non-zoo staff they had seen, our visit gave them a taste of what to expect when the space opens to visitors tomorrow.

Speaking of visitors, what can you expect from the new lion enclosure?

Well, it's a state-of-the-art facility that's been created using environmentally considerate construction techniques, including climate controlled heated dens which are heated by sustainable 'green' energy and supported by fully insulated walls and roof, which will minimise power consumption to create year-round optimum conditions for the big cats.

There's also raised hilltop viewing points for the pride, as well as sandy areas, heated rocks and a water hole, as well as an indoor area which eventually will become home to a group of mongoose who should arrive in February.

They will 'timeshare' the area with the lions, who spend most of their time outside anyway, with both sets of animals dividing their time spent in there.

The raised hilltop mounds where the lions spend most of their day resting are high up to give them a unique perspective on their habitat, and directly opposite is a mound for visitors to stand on which will enable them to stand at the same height.

In the large outdoor open space, there's also a cave-like shelter and a zip wire for meat distribution to various points within the paddock.

It's a wonderful new home for the lions, and staff are hoping that the new habitat will help the zoo raise some much needed awareness of the plight of Asiatic lions like Kumari, Kiburi and Iblis.

Dr Mark Pilgrim, the zoo's Chief Executive Officer said: ""This remarkable species is facing a very uncertain future.

""The European endangered species breeding programme is critically important. If the worst was to happen in the wild, good zoos would be the only thing standing between Asiatic lions and extinction.



“We’re very proud to be able to give the Asiatic lion pride the world’s best conservation breeding facilities. We also hope the new area will help us raise much needed awareness about the plight of Asiatic lions.""

Lions have been at Chester Zoo since the 1930s and have always been a big part of the zoo's remarkable story.





“Lions were among the first carnivores cared for here by Chester Zoo’s founder George Mottershead,"" added Dr Pilgrim. ""He was a pioneering animal welfare advocate, who realised his vision for the first ‘zoo without bars’.

""Our ongoing habitat creation programme continues to deliver George’s ‘always building’ philosophy, which has pushed the boundaries of world-class animal welfare and conservation in zoos.”

But don't just take it from me - go and see it for yourself."~[]

As part of the Zoo’s cooperative breeding agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association, all cubs born at the Zoo move to China when they are 4 years old. Bei Bei turned 4 Aug. 22.

“Our giant pandas represent much of what the Smithsonian does best, from conservation to education,” said Lonnie Bunch, Secretary of the Smithsonian. “As we say goodbye to our beloved Bei Bei, our conservation scientists will continue to work in collaboration to prevent these animals from disappearing, giving them the opportunity to thrive in the wild, inspiring and teaching generations to come.”

“Bei Bei is part of our family,” said Steve Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. “Our team has cared for him, learned from him and, along with millions, loved watching him grow. We’re sad he’s leaving, but excited for the contributions he will make to the global giant panda population. Bei Bei is an ambassador for conservation and part of a 47-year program that proves bringing species and habitats back from the brink is possible through global cooperation.”

Panda keepers are already preparing Bei Bei for the move to make sure he is comfortable and safe during his journey. Part of the preparations will include acclimating Bei Bei to a travel crate. The crate will be placed in the David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat. At first, keepers will ask Bei Bei to walk through it every day. After he has adjusted to walking through the crate, they will acclimate him to spending short periods of time in it with the door closed. Keepers will offer him treats while he is in the crate.

When Bei Bei departs for China, he will be accompanied by one panda keeper and one veterinarian. FedEx will fly Bei Bei and the panda team non-stop from Washington, D.C., to Chengdu, China, in a dedicated B777 aircraft as part of the company’s FedEx Cares “Delivering for Good” initiative. FedEx uses its global network and logistics expertise to help organizations with mission-critical needs in times of disaster and for special shipments. FedEx also donated dedicated aircrafts to bring Bei Bei’s older brother Tai Shan to China in 2010, older sister Bao Bao to China in 2017 and their parents, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, to the United States in 2000. It is better for pandas to travel in the fall and winter months when it is cool, instead of in the heat of summer. The panda team will continuously monitor Bei Bei during the trip and will travel with a supply of his favorite treats, including bamboo, apples, pears, carrots, cooked sweet potatoes, biscuits and water.

Upon arrival in Chengdu, Bei Bei’s new keepers will accompany him to one of the bases run by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. The American team will follow, and a panda keeper will remain with Bei Bei for a short time while he acclimates to his new home. Bei Bei will enter the giant panda breeding program when he reaches sexual maturity between 5 and 7 years old.

From Nov.11 to Nov. 18, the Zoo will hold an online and on-site series of “Bye Bye, Bei Bei” celebratory events to bid a fond farewell to Bei Bei before he begins the next chapter of his life in China. Details on the celebration will be shared and posted to the Zoo’s website soon. The Zoo will be using #ByeByeBeiBei on all updates posted on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Bei Bei was born Aug. 22, 2015, at the Zoo’s David M. Rubenstein Family Giant Panda Habitat. He has been living separately from his mother Mei Xiang since March 2017. Giant pandas are solitary in the wild, and cubs separate from their mothers to establish their own territories between 18 months and 2 years old.

Giant pandas are listed as “vulnerable” in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are an estimated 1,800 in the wild. Scientists at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute work with scientists in China studying giant panda reproduction and cub health, habitat and disease. Chinese scientists are working to reintroduce giant pandas to the wild.

Always free of charge and open 364 days a year (closed Dec. 25), the Smithsonian’s National Zoo is one of Washington, D.C.’s most popular tourist destinations, with approximately 2 million visitors from all over the world each year. The Zoo instills a lifelong commitment to conservation through engaging experiences with animals and the people working to save them. Today, the Zoo sits on 163 acres in the heart of Washington’s Rock Creek Park and is home to 2,700 animals representing more than 390 species. The Zoo’s commitment to conservation, research and education extends to the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), located in nearby Front Royal, Virginia. SCBI scientists and animal care experts conduct veterinary and reproductive research to save wildlife and habitats for some of the world’s most endangered animals on the sprawling 3,200-acre campus and in more than 30 countries across the globe."~[]

By Jim Knox

The Red Panda is considered one of the world’s few “Peter Pan” animals who never outgrows it’s youthful appearance…and it is precisely this fact that aids this animal who needs all the help it can muster.

Nature has a habit of presenting us with conundrums. From flightless birds to duck-billed mammals, to sprinting tortoises (yes, they exist!), we are constantly astounded and rewarded when Mother Nature reveals her rule-breaking handiwork. As humans, we crave order. We want a nice, logical place for everything and everything in its place. Thank goodness nature embraces originality and innovation because it’s through these rule-breaking creatures and the, can’t-quite-put-a-name-to-a-face beasts, that we learn so much.

Leading the ranks of these species is Ailurus fulgens or the Red Panda. This medium-sized mammal is widely known by all, yet simultaneously, well understood by few. Commonly called cat-bear, Firefox and Lesser Panda (they’re particularly sensitive about this one), the Red Panda is related to many, more familiar beasts. Distantly related to Giant Pandas, and closer kin to raccoons, Red Pandas are the only living member of their taxonomic family, the Ailuridae. Not surprisingly, the Red Panda possesses familiar and highly advantageous traits from their distant cousins. From its stocky, bear-shaped body, to its foxlike ears, and ringed, raccoon-like tail, this modest beast is superbly adapted to an arboreal life among the cool mountainous forests of the Himalayan region.

Originally classified as a carnivore, the Red Panda possesses stout jaws and sharp teeth yet these omnivores prefer to eat tender bamboo shoots and leaves over meat, 98% of the time. Rounding out their diet with the occasional fruit, insect, bird egg, bird or small mammal, Red Pandas adapt well to seasonal scarcity and abundance, exploiting available food sources. Reaching 3.5 feet in length and tipping the scales at 7-14 pounds, the panda is the size of a fox. Like its distant cousin the Red Fox, this beast also sports a flaming red coat with occasional gold highlights. Rounding out its appearance, the panda possesses a pointy snout, white patches of facial fur, black fur extending to its legs and bear-like paws, and a long ringed bushy tail, tipped with black or white. This coloration actually aids them as camouflage among the reddish-brown mosses and white lichens in the Fir canopy of their native forests.

A closer look reveals a creature boasting specialized skills. The panda’s reddish-brown “tear marks” extend from its eyes to the corners of its mouth and serve to keep the sun’s glare out of its eyes. The raccoon-like tail aids in providing both exceptional balance high above the forest floor, and in warming the panda’s face and body when draped over to conserve warmth. Semi-retractable claws provide excellent gripping capability when climbing and the panda’s extraordinarily flexible ankles enable this beast to climb headfirst down tree trunks. Like Giant Pandas, they possess a modified wrist bone known as a pseudo-thumb which enables them to grasp and manipulate bamboo and other foods, with deft, nearly hand-like ability. Though crepuscular, or active at dawn and dusk periods, Red Pandas modify their schedules and activity to conserve energy. Colder temperatures prompt temporary dormancy, yet under such conditions, the panda remarkably raises its metabolic rate every few hours to search for food.

My work confers the privilege of working with animals such as the Red Panda. They are part of a program known as an S.S.P. or Species Survival Plan, a highly-coordinated worldwide effort—administered regionally at Connecticut’s Beardsley Zoo—to breed endangered creatures, educate guests and restore species populations to the wild. Over the years, I’ve found that when guests can relate to an animal or species, they are far more likely to protect them. It’s natural to want to protect what we have grown to understand and love…or at least care about.

The Red Panda is considered one of the world’s few “Peter Pan” animals who never outgrows it’s youthful appearance…and it is precisely this fact that aids this animal who needs all the help it can muster. With a habitat under increasing threat from climate shift, illegal logging and other environmental degradation, the Red Panda needs a superpower. Enter cuteness. In nature, cute doesn’t exactly yield dividends, yet in the human world, cute can engender caring, rally support, and generate conservation action. As a species, when we protect cute, we extend that protection to all of the plants and animals who live in the same habitat. For every Red Panda or Sugar Glider, there is an Atlantic Hagfish or Marabou Stork benefitting from their more photogenic neighbors.

In the panda, we see a creature who is not quite what it seems on the surface. We encounter a beast with one set of obvious characteristics and another, more discrete compliment of on-demand traits which it employs with great effect. Perhaps not the boldest creature, but highly capable when necessary. Familiar to most but truly understood by few. It is a rule-breaking innovator when the situation calls for it and a creature whose appeal belies its capability. Equal parts fierce and cute…the Red Panda gains both our respect and our caring. Perhaps in the panda, we see a bit of ourselves. If you haven’t become acquainted with these humble creatures, I encourage you to take some time out of your busy week to visit them, read about them, check out a “Panda Cam” or otherwise get to know the little beast behind that adorable face.

“Asiatic lions are impressively built animals, with compact bodies, powerful legs and strong jaws and teeth, making them superb hunters.

“Their retractable claws, which they use for gripping tightly on to prey, can be up to 38mm long and they have rough tongues, like sandpaper, for scraping meat from bones.”

The spokesman said the area, which has been specially created by the zoo’s carnivore experts, spans 4,780 square metres in total. Recreating the scrubland savannahs of India’s Gir Forest region, the dry forest habitat contains raised hilltop viewing points for the pride, as well as heated rocks and a water hole.

It’s also complete with heated indoor dens, which will one day be the perfect environment for cubs. The state-of-the-art facility could be a major boost to the European breeding programme for the species, which is teetering on the brink of extinction in the wild.

As few as 650 lions are thought to remain in the wild. Poaching, human-wildlife conflict, habitat loss and disease have caused a catastrophic decline in Asiatic lion populations in their natural range. The last Asiatic lions populations survive in Gujarat, India, in the Gir Forest region, but this is just 0.1 per cent of their former territories.

The species once roamed across Northern Africa, Greece, Turkey and Asia but are now confined to one small region of India, where natural disaster or an outbreak of disease could wipe out the entire species.

Local community action, supported by international conservationists, has helped to slowly increase numbers in recent years, but the species remains Endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) ‘Red List’ of threatened species – meaning it is still faced with a high chance of extinction.

Dr Mark Pilgrim, Chief Executive Officer, said:

“We’re very proud to be able to give the Asiatic lion pride the world’s best conservation breeding facilities. We also hope the new area will help us raise much-needed awareness about the plight of Asiatic lions.

“Lions were among the first carnivores cared for here by Chester Zoo’s founder George Mottershead. He was a pioneering animal wellbeing advocate, who realised his vision for the first ‘zoo without bars’. Our ongoing habitat creation programme continues to deliver George’s ‘always building’ philosophy, which has pushed the boundaries of world-class animal wellbeing and conservation in zoos.”

A spokesman for the zoo said the new habitat, which has been created using environmentally considerate construction techniques, has been created using the latest sustainable construction standards. Climate controlled dens, heated by sustainable ‘green’ energy and supported by fully insulated walls and roof, will minimise power consumption in order to create year-round optimum conditions for the big cats.

In a statement titled “Bye Bye, Bei Bei” on October 18, Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute invited D.C. locals to a series of celebratory events to say goodbye to Bei Bei ahead of his travel to China. The events will be both online and on-site.

As per a cooperative breeding agreement between the Smithsonian institute and the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA), the giant panda was planned to stay in the country until he turned four, which happened in August.

“All cubs born at the Zoo move to China when four years old to breed with other pandas, helping to keep the population genetically diverse,” the statement said.

After they move to China, giant pandas will take part in the breeding program once they reach sexual maturity between five and seven years old.

“Our giant pandas represent much of what the Smithsonian does best, from conservation to education,” Lonnie Bunch, secretary of the Smithsonian, said in the statement. “As we say goodbye to our beloved Bei Bei, our conservation scientists will continue to work in collaboration to prevent these animals from disappearing, giving them the opportunity to thrive in the wild, inspiring and teaching generations to come.”

We are officially bidding a bitter-sweet farewell to #BeiBei! He will move to China Nov. 19. We are hosting a farewell celebration from Nov. 11 to Nov. 18. #PandaStory #ByeByeBeiBei https://t.co/hEMAXB5vZe pic.twitter.com/IRhZYNLyPe — National Zoo (@NationalZoo) October 18, 2019

Calling Bei Bei “part of our family,” Steve Monfort, director of the Smithsonian’s institute, said:

“Our team has cared for him, learned from him and, along with millions, loved watching him grow. We’re sad he’s leaving, but excited for the contributions he will make to the global giant panda population. Bei Bei is an ambassador for conservation and part of a 47-year program that proves bringing species and habitats back from the brink is possible through global cooperation.”

While keepers at the zoo are preparing Bei Bei for his move, other preparations have been going on for celebratory public events that will take place from Monday, November 11, through Monday, November 18. Bei bei will also be streamed live on the institute’s website on Panda Cam 1.

The institute explained on its website that giant pandas were listed as “vulnerable” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and that there are currently around 1,800 of them in the wild.

In order to increase the number of wild pandas and their habitat, scientists in China have been putting efforts such as the breeding program. They are aiming to reintroduce pandas born in zoos to the wild."~[]

For nearly the past two decades, French photographer Laurent Baheux has traversed the vast expanses of wild Africa – the savannas and grasslands, the woodlands and wetlands – to document its most glorious forms of life. With his patience and trained eye, Baheux’s resulting black-and-white photographs have captured leopards, tigers, zebras, monkey, leopards, elephants and giraffes in hushed and emotive states, lounging with their siblings or cuddling their young. His portraits are visually exquisite while showing the social and emotive semblances across the animal kingdom.

In his latest oeuvre Lions (teNeues, EUR 40), he pays homage to the “king of animals” with new and archive footage of the individuals, families and prides he’s tracked during more than 30 trips across Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. But the book’s purpose is nobler than to look pretty on a coffee table; it also stands as a reminder that the existence of this most beloved of species is not a guarantee. The future of the lion depends on its native habitat – which depends increasingly on the actions and inactions of humans. But it’s not just a one-way street, says Baheux. There are lessons to be learned from lions about how to live off the Earth, not only to ensure their survival, but also our own.

Your first major trip to report on wildlife was to Tanzania in 2002. How have you seen the country’s landscape and wildlife change since then?

I have just returned from a trip to the country, and in 17 years, I have seen the human pressure intensify around areas reserved for wildlife. The cohabitation of large mammals in general – and with predators in particular – has become more and more difficult. We need to understand that the less we leave natural habitat for wild animals, human-animal conflict will continue to increase. Competing with them for their habitat gives them little chance of survival.

Did any daily routines or work habits help you capture these shots?

By photographing animals in their natural environment, I learned to see them first as individuals and not together as a species. Every lion is unique and unlike any other: each has his or her own physical appearance, own personality, own character. To portray this means seeking to bring out these features, this charisma, this truth – as one would do when portraying another human.

“Lioness scanning the horizon,” Tanzania, 2018. Photo © 2019 Laurent Baheux. All rights reserved.

What do you find so beautiful about the way lions interact with one another?

What is fascinating about lions is the mixture of strength and fragility they emit. They are big predators, able to kill to survive and feed their families. And at the same time, they are able – like us – to show affection, tenderness, that they love each other and are benevolent to other members of their clan. Through simple portraits, these are all those little moments of the lions’ daily lives that I like to observe and that I sometimes manage to capture.

During the 17 years collecting the footage in this book, did you see certain individual lions repeatedly? If so, what was it like to watch them grow and change ?

Yes. I saw and photographed lions in the prime of lives, handsome and powerful. I found some of them in their old age, at the ends of their lives, much less flamboyant. I’m happy to have had the chance to immortalize them when they were at the top of their reign.

“Smile or die,” Kenya, 2019. Photo © 2019 Laurent Baheux. All rights reserved.

What have you learned from these animals ?

That to survive, they must necessarily live in harmony with their environment and respect the rules that govern the fragile natural balances. They have the instinct of not unnecessarily destroying the habitat that allows them to feed themselves.

You work on your own, in order to be “invisible” and not disrupt the animals’ lives. What is it like, to spend so many hours alone in remote places?

I like to suffer the slow pace of nature. I like to feel that I am not a decision-maker, that it is not me, the photographer, who will choose where, when and how to photograph or even if a photographic moment will happen. Not being in control of the situation allows me, as a human, to find a little humility in the face of nature.

Why have you been so drawn to Africa’s landscapes in particular?

More than the landscapes, it is the encounters with the big animals of the African continent that attract me: to see evolving this big, free and wild fauna in the middle of a savanna that has not changed for thousands of years gives emotions that are difficult to describe. I sometimes feel like I’m going back in time, to the origins of animal life.

“The lioness on the lookout,” Tanzania, 2018. Photo © 2019 Laurent Baheux. All rights reserved.

What are the biggest threats facing lions, and what can we do to help?

The population of African lions has been halved in the last 25 years and decreased tenfold in just one century. One hundred years ago, there were 200,000 lions. Today, there are only 20,000 left, now considered vulnerable to extinction. This blazing disappearance is essentially due to man, who transforms the lions’ hunting areas into farming spaces and slaughters the prey of the predator, depriving him of his food. The reduction of prey that lions usually hunt, an inexorable consequence of the bushmeat trade, forces lions to come into contact with humans and their livestock to survive. When they attack cattle, they can be killed in retaliation, most often poisoned. As human infrastructure grows and spreads, lions see their habitat fragment, preventing young males from founding their clans. Baheux’

And then there’s poaching, which is still very present. Bones of tigers and rhinoceros’s horns have become rarefied, so lions are now prime targets. Their body parts – skin, teeth, paws and claws – are used in rituals and traditional Chinese medicine. This is still a lucrative market, but also much less risky and much less punished than the arms or drug trade.

Beyond the massive deforestation of the savanna, which has led to the imbalance of lion populations between West, East and Central Africa, income from tourism is what will decide the presence or disappearance of these felines. Countries in Southern and East Africa, which have developed tourism, protect lions to continue attracting visitors. West Africa, which is much less frequented, profits more from a dead lion than a living, exploiting in the wake the territory left vacant. By 2035, according to some scientists, half of the current lion population will have disappeared, and there will be only 10,000 left in the wild. Lions, lionesses and lion cubs could completely disappear by 2050.

What does this book mean to you? And what do you hope it means to readers?

This book is my homage to the nobility of the lion, to the lion’s magnificence. This animal has always been at the heart of myths and the sacred. I would like readers to realize that if the most emblematic representative of the animal kingdom disappears, all life on earth will be threatened. It must quickly become clear that to protect wildlife, we must preserve its spaces."~[]

Huo Hu and Tiang Tang were born in June and have been staying in a nest box with mother Nima and father Koda.

With fewer than 10,000 red pandas estimated in the wild, the endangered cubs were a boost to the zoo’s breeding programme aimed at increasing the species’ population.

Andrew Mckenzie, deputy curator of mammals at the zoo, said: “Red pandas are the most incredible, beautiful species, but they’re under serious threat in the wild from human activity.

“Widespread habitat destruction, trapping for the illegal pet trade and poaching for fur have led to a rapidly decreasing population.

“A world without red pandas is simply unthinkable, so the European breeding programme for the species is increasingly important.

“Thankfully, our little male, Huo Hu, and his sister, Tiang Tang, are thriving.

“After snuggling up in their nest boxes over summer, they’re now looking big and strong. They’re ready to explore!”"~[]

NEW YORK CITY (WABC) -- Two endangered and rare falcons that were rescued and nursed back to health have been set free, and Eyewitness News was there -- exclusively -- for the release.The Peregrine Falcon is on New York State's endangered species list, but that may be about to change.""The most important thing is you have to be very careful not injuring the bird or bending any of the flight feathers, the wing, or tailfeathers,"" New York City Department of Environmental Protection research scientist Christopher Nadareski said.It is the world's fastest animal, but a 1-year-old Peregrine has been sitting in captivity for months after being found injured and immobile in a Lower Manhattan parking garage.""She was bruised up, but nothing serious,"" Nadareski said.And 20 stories above ground on a cold windy morning, Nadareski showed us how months of rehabilitation led up to one amazing moment.""Three, two, one, come on, come on, good, wow,"" Nadareski said. ""Look at that terrific, woah, terrific flight, terrific flight.""The falcons were released back into the wild, returning to their place atop the food chain.""And I'm only picking my finger up on the upper mandible (jawbone/beak),"" Nadareski said. ""There's a little tooth right behind the hook and a little notch on the lower mandible, but it slides into, it's kind of like a severing device.""When people think of New York City, wild birds may not be the first thing that pops into their head. But you may be surprised at just how many call this dense urban jungle home.""We have approximately 25 pair of nesting Peregrine Falcon in the five boroughs,"" Nadareski said. ""We boast the highest concentration of anywhere in the world with the Peregrine Falcon with this close nesting proximity...25% of New York City is green, between city parks state parks and federal park land.""Aggressive pesticide use after World War II once landed the predator on the federal endangered species list, and in New York, it's still considered endangered.Wildlife rehabilitators are trying to get these powerful birds off that list and back in flight.----------"~[]

A pair of male red panda cubs are delighting visitors to the Prospect Park Zoo.

The cubs — named Qi (pronounced “chee”), which means “life force,” and Liu, which means “willow” — were born over the summer in their indoor den at the zoo, where their mother, Willow, has been taking care of them, but now they are old enough to explore their outside habitat, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.

When red pandas are born, they are lighter in color and have softer and plusher coats. As they get older, their coats darken. Adulthood is when they turn about 18 months old, WCS says. This particular family are a subspecies from the eastern Himalayan range in China and northern Myanmar called Styan’s red pandas— they are a little larger and have a deeper red color than the western red pandas found at the Bronx and Central Park zoos.

WCS has been breeding red pandas and New York City’s zoos as part of the Species Survival Plan, a cooperative breeding program by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums meant to enhance the genetic viability and demographic stability of animal populations at accredited zoos.

You’ll be able to see behind the scenes of the red panda breeding program in an episode of “The Zoo” on Animal Planet in early 2020. But if you want to see them in person, tickets to the zoo (450 Flatbush Ave.) are $9.95, and hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m."~[]

PROSPECT PARK — In another successful moment for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s endangered species breeding program, two red panda cubs born at the Prospect Park Zoo are beginning to explore their habitat.

Visitors can witness the awkward, kitten-like babies taking some of their first steps outdoors in the coming weeks.

“The cubs are tiny replicas of their parents and, like little children, they’re still wobbly and bouncy when they walk and run,” Director of the Prospect Park Zoo Denise McClean told this paper. “They look like plush toys playing.”

Red pandas are known for their tree climbing agility and large, bushy tails. They have very soft, red-brown coats for warmth and black limbs and bellies.

One of the cubs explores its surroundings.

The cubs’ mother, Willow, has cared for them indoors since their summer birth. Now, they are old enough to head outside.

“As an endangered species and part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ Species Survival Plan, these cubs are part of a successful breeding program and we’re very proud to be able to contribute to this effort,” said McClean.

The Wildlife Conservation Society’s breeding program helps stabilize endangered animal populations within its zoos. The cubs will reach adulthood in about a year.

The babies take a walk with their mother, Willow.

Fans can tune into the upcoming season of the Animal Planet docu-series “THE ZOO” this winter for a behind-the-scenes look at the zoo’s red panda breeding program.

The Prospect Park Zoo is located at 450 Flatbush Ave. in Prospect Park and is open 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., November through March. For more information, visit www.prospectparkzoo.com.

Accoring to the Dallas Zoo, a male mandrill named Jax has moved to the Phoenix Zoo based on a recommendation from The Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan.

The Dallas Zoo said they are sad to say goodbye to Jax, but they know that he is going to have the chance to thrive as the leader of his own troop in Phoenix.

Obi, another male mandrill, will also be leaving the zoo in the near future. The mandrills are endangered, and Obi's genes are needed at another AZA-accredited institution to ensure the long-term survival of his threatened species, the Dallas Zoo said.

The Dallas Zoo said a dedicated team of zoologists were working to keep Obi active and stimulated throughout the day with a robust enrichment plan.

The zoo said it is never easy to say goodbye to animals, but they know this is the best decision for their well-being."~[]

Updated: Nov 22, 2019 17:57 IST

A search is on for a red panda that broke out of a zoo in the Rhone region of southeastern France. Officials at the Saint-Martin-la-Plaine Zoo said the endangered animal was last seen 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the park by a surprised motorist. The park said the panda escaped last Friday by climbing up branches broken by snowfall and swinging from tree to tree.

The panda, a cat-sized nocturnal animal with reddish fur and a shaggy tail, would probably spend “a good part of the day sleeping in a tree.” The zoo advised residents to keep a look out “at the top of the trees.”

Zoo veterinarian Jean-Christophe Gerard said the animal “has good claws and good teeth” and shouldn’t be hugged, although it isn’t considered dangerous.

A zoo in central France said it found a runaway red panda on Saturday, a week after it escaped by scaling branches broken by snowfall.

The zoological park in Saint-Martin-la-Plaine said a man discovered the endangered furry mammal in his garden.

“We were called this morning around 8:15 am by a resident. He saw the red panda on a shrub in his garden,” said park vet Dr Jean-Christophe Gerard in a statement.

A team headed immediately to the site and recovered the red panda.

“The little panda appears to be in good health and has not suffered from his stay outside the park, even if he is a bit thinner,” Gerard said.

The three-year-old male escaped from the park last Thursday, taking advantage of heavy snowfall that brought down trees.

His female partner did not follow him out of the zoo.

On Wednesday, a driver spotted the animal some 10 kilometres (six miles) from the zoo but the police and zoo staff were unable to locate it.

The shy creatures spend most of their time in trees and are not considered dangerous.

Vets will be monitor the panda over the next few days to ensure his well-being.

Pradesh’s Kuno Palpur Wildlife sanctuary in Sheopur district is all set to be the new home for relocated Asiatic lions from Gir in Gujarat.

The action plan aims to guide the reintroduction program of the Asiatic lions in Kuno in a manner based on science and pro-active management.

The current carrying capacity of Kuno WLS is a maximum of 40 lions. Population Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) models for Kuno lions show that the lion population will be viable for a long-term only at a minimum figure of around 80 individuals.

“Still waiting for new beginning”.

The words in bold, white, are painted alongside a mural of a lion and lioness, on a sign near the forest guest house in Palpur village inside the Kuno Palpur wildlife sanctuary in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The guest house overlooks Kuno river and offers a clear glimpse into the heart of the forest and the wildlife of the sanctuary. The sun shines bright on the landscape, welcoming a new day and perhaps the start of a new chapter for the sanctuary.

After more than two decades of roadblocks, the Kuno Palpur wildlife sanctuary is ready as the new home for Asiatic lions, starting with those that are to be relocated from Gujarat’s Gir sanctuary, currently the only home of the Asiatic lions in India. In a recent visit over two days, Mongabay-India witnessed the revamped sanctuary.

The areas of grassland habitat are ready to provide food for the animals that lions prey upon like nilgai (blue bull), chital (spotted deer), sambhar, chinkara. “The grass on the sites of the 24 villages that existed here and have already been relocated outside, as a part of the lion reintroduction program, have grown. There is no sign of human habitat. The villages have been developed into large grasslands, making the sanctuary almost free from human habitation for the free and flexible movements of lions,” Vijendra Shrivastav, sub-divisional officer, Kuno Palpur (West) Wildlife Sanctuary told Mongabay-India as he spoke about the preparations of the sanctuary to receive lions from Gir wildlife sanctuary in Gujarat.

“We are asking just for two pride of lions that typically includes a male, three to five females and their young cubs. On successful relocation, the family of lions will access the unused habitats and will also increase the seasonal mast availability for wildlife in the sanctuary and diversity.”

It has been 29 years since Kuno Palpur was identified as the site for the relocation of Asiatic lions, from their last habitat in Gujarat, to protect them from extinction. Currently, there are 523 (as per the last census carried out in 2015) lions in Gir and this relocation project was supposed to have been completed by 2020.

The “Action plan for the reintroduction of the Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) in Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary – Draft 2016” prepared by the expert committee for translocations of lions from Gir to Kuno Sanctuary observed that the “last free-ranging population of approximately 523 Asiatic lions Panthera leo persica are found in the 22,000 square kilometre of the Gir landscape in Gujarat, western India. Carnivore populations restricted to single sites face a variety of extinction threats from genetic and stochastic environmental factors.” The draft is now under implementation.

Catastrophes such as an epidemic, an unexpected decline in prey, natural calamities or retaliatory killings could result in the extinction of the lion population when they are restricted to single populations, the action plan adds.

Reintroduction of Asiatic lions to an alternative site to ensure their long-term viability has become a major conservation agenda since the late-1950s. Failure of the first attempt of the Asiatic lion reintroduction in India (Chandraprabha Wildlife Sanctuary of Uttar Pradesh) in the 1960s has been ascribed to the lack of an a priori scientific study on lion prey base, habitat requirements, local people’s attitude and a post-release monitoring program, notes the plan.

In the early 1990s, after ecological assessment of some protected areas within the historical range of lions was undertaken, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) identified Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary (Kuno WLS) in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh as the most potential reintroduction site. Subsequently, between 1996 and 2001, 23 villages were resettled from inside the identified Kuno sanctuary by the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department (MPFD) and an area of about 1,280 square km was demarcated as Kuno wildlife division.

A new home for the Asiatic lion is finally materialising

Located in north Madhya Pradesh, Kuno was one of the hunting grounds of the royal families of the region and was notified as a sanctuary in 1981. “The sanctuary is classified under the semi-arid – Gujarat Rajputana biogeographic zone,” a senior forest officer of the Madhya Pradesh’s forest department said.

According to Azad Singh Dabhas, a retired forest officer, “in the 1990s, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) took up the matter of finding an alternative home for the species and identified Kuno Wildlife Sanctuary as the most suitable site.”

He explained that the idea was to have a second sanctuary for lions incase an epidemic, an unexpected decline in prey, natural calamities or retaliatory killings resulted in the extinction of the lions that are currently restricted to a single site – Gir National Park in Gujarat.

Between 1996 and 2001 the Madhya Pradesh Government relocated 23 villages containing 1,547 families from Kuno Sanctuary in preparation for the new lion population. “Not a single incidence of poaching and human-animal conflict has been reported in the last three years,” said a senior official of the sanctuary.

Though the sanctuary is inhabited by carnivores such as leopard, wolf, jackal, Indian fox and striped hyena, in the last over two decades, the population of chital, sambar, nilgai, chinkara, wild pig, chowsingha, and blackbuck are found in abundance.

“One of the major challenges was of the sites of the relocated villages to develop them into grasslands. The sites of the relocated villages have developed into large grasslands, extending in size to as much as 1,500 ha in some cases,” said Shrivastav.

According to Atul Chouhan, Kuno Sangharsh Samiti, “The state tourism department is successfully running a three-star hotel located on the Shivpuri Highway. A large number of visitors prefer to stay in the forest guest house, which is located inside the Kuno Reserve and is around 25 kilometres from the Tiktoli, the entry gate to the Kuno Reserve. Round the year more than 2,000 visitors come to Kuno Reserve. And the number of visitors to Kuno is rising up. If, lions are going to be introduced in Kuno Reserve the footfall is certainly going to rise.”

The Samiti, now with about 2,000 members, was formed by like-minded people of Sheopur district in 2009-10 after the Gujarat government refused to share lions. The Samiti, along with the forest dwellers who were shifted from the sanctuary have held protests, submitted memorandums to the government alleging that they sacrificed their ancestral homes and land in a way to provide a safe place for the lions. They demanded that the government should respect their sacrifice and take constructive efforts to introduce lions in Kuno Palpur.

Chouhan wants the government to involve youth of the villages in tourism activities by training them as field guides of the sanctuary.

From the 24 villages, a total of 1,545 families were affected. The villagers were relocated to Karhal tehsil of Sheopur district.

“We have left our ancestral homes, anticipating that we are doing it for a bigger cause by understanding the need of the government to provide a safe place for lions and conversation of our natural heritage. But, what we have received nothing in return. There are no signs of lions being introduced in the Kuno. The government has done injustice with us,” said Kapoor Singh Yadav, a resident of village Naya Paron situated on the Sheopur-Shivpuri State Highway.

Yadav, along with his family members and 50 odd families of village Paron, which was situated inside the Kuno Palpur Sanctuary, shifted to the new location in 2004.

Gujarat’s reluctance to relocate the lions

As per the action plan, the Standing Committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) endorsed the lion reintroduction program in Kuno. However, the proposal met with resistance from the Gujarat Forest Department (GFD) which was reluctant to provide founder lions from Gir for reintroduction purposes. An affidavit was also filed before the Supreme Court of India objecting the lion reintroduction.

Gujarat government has been refusing to give lions to Madhya Pradesh alleging that it would not be safe to shift the mighty beast to a state which has failed to protect its own tiger population.

After legal tangles spanning for almost two decades, the apex court finally gave its verdict in April 2013 and explicitly directed the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India (GoI) to expedite the lion reintroduction in Kuno in compliance with the IUCN guidelines of carnivore reintroduction.

Accordingly, the 2016 draft action plan was developed under the directives of the Additional Director General (Wildlife) to guide a successful lion reintroduction in Kuno. The plan, now under implementation, enlists various ecological, biological, management and social facets in accordance with the IUCN/SSC guidelines to develop a time-bound protocol essential for implementing the reintroduction program. Some management actions recommended in the action plan are concomitant and should continue for long-term, it notes.

Gir in Gujarat is the last refuge of the Asian lion population. According to the 14th Lion Estimation Population Report, the lion population has increased by 27 percent from 411 in 2010 to 523 in 2015. The increase in lion numbers inside the protected area has been just six percent (as of 337 to 356), however, the rise outside has been higher 126 percent (from 74 to 167).

A large number of lions wander outside the Gir National Park in the eco-sensitive zone of the Gir Protected Area. In 2018, when the deaths of 23 lions in Gir took place, the Gujarat government maintained it to be a one-off incident. The government allegedly refused to touch and go in deep to dig out the medical analytical cause behind the deaths. After the incident, the Gujarat government launched a Rs. 350 crore (Rs. 3.5 billion) lion conservation project. The project was reviewed by Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani in July 2019, when, during rains visuals of lion frisking in the urban areas of Gir Forest hit social media.

The reintroduction plan

The expert committee has suggested a four-phase plan for the reintroduction of lion in Kuno which involves organisational commitments, ecological monitoring and quantifying social carrying capacity of lion reintroduction, followed by capture, translocation and soft release of lions in Kuno, post-reintroduction monitoring & research, conflict mitigation, followed with an annual review of the project. The first three phases would be undertaken over a period of two years, after which, upto the next 20 years or so the plan highlights genetic management & supplementation, under which six lions (two males and four females) should be supplemented in the Kuno population from Gir until 16-20 years from the first reintroduction at an interval of 4 years.

The report maintains, carnivore reintroduction is an appropriate conservation strategy to restore the integrity of ecosystems. However, many pitfalls exist that can result in the total or partial failure of a reintroduction program and can potentially waste valuable and limited resources.

Lion population could reach a capacity of 80 individuals in 30 years

According to Kuno divisional forest officer, current habitat management initiatives by Madhya Pradesh Forest Department (MPFD) inside Kuno WLS such as weed eradication, fire management, grassland management, waterhole management etc. would continue so as to enhance nutritional carrying capacity for wild ungulates, which would serve as a prey base for the lions

Although the current carrying capacity of lions at Kuno WLS is a maximum of 40 lions, Population Habitat Viability Analysis (PHVA) models for Kuno lions show that the lion population will be viable for long- term only at a minimum figure of around 80 individuals.

Expecting approximately a realised growth that has been observed for recovering tiger populations, along with supplementation every four years from Gir; the lion population in Kuno WLS should reach the current carrying capacity of 40 within 15 years.

To reach the required self-sustaining population size of 80 lions, the time required would be close to 30 years.

The activity was slow and tricky. The recordings reveal that blue whale hearts are operating at extremes. The The mission and a snippet of the recording is shown in the following video: When the whale dives, its heart rate slows to four to eight beats per minute. As it consumes prey, the heart rate rises about 2.5 times the minimum. When the whale surfaces, its heart rate increases to 25 to 37 beats per minutes, when breathing and restoring oxygen levels. The fact that the heart rate is close to the maximum emphasizes why blue whales are susceptible to changes in their environment. The research carries important implications for the conservation and management of such endangered species. Blue whales have been declared The research has been To undertake the feat, precise and sensitive monitoring equipment was required. Marine scientists from Stanford University, carefully stored the instrumentation into a neon orange plastic shell and positioned these close to the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) target. The device was secured using four suction cups located close to the whale's left flipper.The heart beat recordings were made using electrodes embedded positioned in the center of two of the suction feet. The data captured the tag's journey and captured the heart rate of a blue whale. The measurement suggests that blue whale hearts are operating at extremes – and may limit the whale’s size. This is based on the analysis of the data which infers that the blue whale's heart is close to working at its limit, and this fact probably explains why blue whales have never evolved to be larger. A typical blue whale is close to 30 meters (98 ft) in length and with a maximum recorded weight of 173 tonnes.The mission and a snippet of the recording is shown in the following video:When the whale dives, its heart rate slows to four to eight beats per minute. As it consumes prey, the heart rate rises about 2.5 times the minimum. When the whale surfaces, its heart rate increases to 25 to 37 beats per minutes, when breathing and restoring oxygen levels.The fact that the heart rate is close to the maximum emphasizes why blue whales are susceptible to changes in their environment. The research carries important implications for the conservation and management of such endangered species.

“An adorable little male was born in the early morning of Monday… Madiba, the mother, and her baby are doing well,” the Pairi Daiza zoo said in a statement.

There are roughly 18,000 southern white rhinos in the wild but the subspecies is being exterminated by poachers at a rate of one every eight hours.

Another species of rhino, the world’s second-largest land mammal, the northern white, is in even more danger with only two left in existence.

The remaining northern white pair are both female, so they will die out unless their genes can be preserved or recovered and an artificial breeding program begins.

In July, a southern white calf was born through artificial insemination in San Diego, in what the zoo hailed as a step toward perfecting the technique.

The Belgian zoo has another female, Elie, in gestation. Her birth is expected “by the end of this year.” Both are natural pregnancies, the zoo said.

Elie has already had a calf, Sethemba, who was born in 2016 and has been transferred to a zoo in the Spanish city of Malaga as part of Europe’s captive breeding program.

The zoo announced Thursday morning that Chadwick, a 21-year-old African lion, died from complications related to old age.

The geriatric lion “had dealt with age-related health issues for several years, and outlived the mean life expectancy by almost five years,” according to a post on the zoo's Instagram page.

“Chadwick has been dealing with health issues associated with his advancing age for several years. Two weeks ago he developed lameness in his right forelimb, which rapidly progressed to generalized pain that we suspected was associated with spinal changes. He did not respond to multiple treatments for pain relief,” Dr. Julie Barnes, vice president of Animal Care & Health, in a press release. “Three days ago, we performed a CT scan, which confirmed our suspicion that he had progression of degenerative spinal disease, which is common in geriatric carnivores. Based on his deteriorating condition and his advanced age, the decision was made for humane euthanasia.”

Born at the Indianapolis Zoo in 1998, Chadwick arrived at the Santa Barbara Zoo in 2003 and was the oldest male pedigreed lion alive in an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)-accredited institution, the zoo said.

“We’ll miss Chadwick’s regal presence, trademark roar, and of course, seeing him perched on his rock overlooking the Pacific Ocean,” the zoo said.

The zoo says plans are in the works for more lions at the zoo, which may include ""a male-female pair with a breeding recommendation from the AZA.""

Donations to the zoo in Chadwick's memory can be made here.

Earlier this year, the zoo's last African elephant also passed away after decades at the zoo."~[]

our ability to bring the physiological laboratory to the open ocean through the noninvasive use of a suction cup-attached tag equipped with surface electrodes. Our study provides heart rate data of a large, free-diving whale (blue whale) without prior capture or restraint. We recorded a wide range of heart rates from the tag, reaching only several beats per minute during deep foraging dives (bradycardia) and nearly 40 beats per minute at the sea surface (tachycardia) as the whale recovered from its oxygen debt. The latter likely represents maximal heart rate given the measured duration of the heart beat itself, thereby demonstrating the greatest dynamic range in cardiac activity at this scale.

Abstract The biology of the blue whale has long fascinated physiologists because of the animal’s extreme size. Despite high energetic demands from a large body, low mass-specific metabolic rates are likely powered by low heart rates. Diving bradycardia should slow blood oxygen depletion and enhance dive time available for foraging at depth. However, blue whales exhibit a high-cost feeding mechanism, lunge feeding, whereby large volumes of prey-laden water are intermittently engulfed and filtered during dives. This paradox of such a large, slowly beating heart and the high cost of lunge feeding represents a unique test of our understanding of cardiac function, hemodynamics, and physiological limits to body size. Here, we used an electrocardiogram (ECG)-depth recorder tag to measure blue whale heart rates during foraging dives as deep as 184 m and as long as 16.5 min. Heart rates during dives were typically 4 to 8 beats min−1 (bpm) and as low as 2 bpm, while after-dive surface heart rates were 25 to 37 bpm, near the estimated maximum heart rate possible. Despite extreme bradycardia, we recorded a 2.5-fold increase above diving heart rate minima during the powered ascent phase of feeding lunges followed by a gradual decrease of heart rate during the prolonged glide as engulfed water is filtered. These heart rate dynamics explain the unique hemodynamic design in rorqual whales consisting of a large-diameter, highly compliant, elastic aortic arch that allows the aorta to accommodate blood ejected by the heart and maintain blood flow during the long and variable pauses between heartbeats.

The widely recognized importance of scale in determining function in mammals has led researchers to investigate physiological processes at the extremes of body mass. From the smallest shrews to the largest whales, physiological performance at the extremes may shed light on constraints to body size. In particular, understanding cardiac function at these extremes remains a central challenge in physiology, especially as it relates to energetic demand in the natural environment.

At the largest scale, marine mammals exhibit a suite of anatomical and physiological adaptations to enhance diving ability and improve foraging capacity during a breath hold. The decrease in heart rate associated with the cardiovascular dive response in marine mammals results in heart rates during dives that are lower than resting values, whereas at the sea surface, the heart rates are higher (1, 2). A slower heart rate during dives decreases oxygen delivery to tissues and slows the overall depletion of blood oxygen stores while also decreasing the oxygen consumed by the heart itself (2, 3). The hypothesis (4, 5) that exercise modulates the dive response and increases heart rate during a dive is particularly relevant to the extreme nature of blue whales, because feeding lunges have an estimated metabolic rate 50 times the basal value (6). The lunges are considered to accelerate the depletion of body oxygen stores and account for shorter than expected dive durations (7). Elevated heart rates and increased blood-to-muscle oxygen transfer during a lunge may be critical because of the metabolic cost of a lunge and the low myoglobin (Mb) concentration (0.8 g Mb 100 g−1 muscle) of blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) relative to Mb concentrations 5 to 10 times higher in most marine mammals (1, 8⇓–10). Exercise, depth, and volitional/anticipatory control have been postulated to modify heart rate during the dive response via the autonomic nervous system (4, 5, 11). Increased heart rate with exercise may occur via withdrawal of parasympathetic tone or increased sympathetic tone. Lung compression during descent and expansion during ascent may also contribute to a decrease or increase, respectively, in heart rate via pulmonary stretch receptor reflexes (12).

Any, even minimal, supplementation of aerobic muscle metabolism due to an increased heart rate and blood oxygen delivery to muscle would result in faster depletion of the blood oxygen stores. As a result, the potential duration of aerobic metabolism would be decreased in essential organs, such as the brain and heart, thereby limiting routine dive durations. Such a crucial role for blood oxygen depletion in baleen whales is supported by 5- to 15-fold elevations (relative to a terrestrial control, the cow [Bos Taurus]) in minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) gene expression of neuroglobin, the brain oxygen-binding protein that is associated with increased hypoxemic tolerance (13).

Heart rates during surface and dive periods are also relevant to models of arterial hemodynamics. The biomechanical properties and dimensions of the aortic wall in fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) have led to the hypothesis that, at heart rates ≤10 beats min−1 (bpm) during dives, the highly compliant aortic arch acts as a windkessel that maintains blood flow during the long diastolic periods between heart beats and reduces pulsatility of blood inflow into the rigid distal aorta (14, 15). During surface intervals, it has been postulated that the mechanical properties and dimensions of the aorta in combination with the wavelengths of pressure waves generated with heart rates above 20 bpm allow for destructive interference of reflected and outgoing pressure waves (14). This process decreases the impedance against which the heart must work to eject blood during the cardiac cycle.

Results To date, no heart rate profile data have been collected for any large whale at sea. Therefore, to address these questions of routine heart rate, the dive response, oxygen store management, and hemodynamics in the blue whale, we applied a suction cup-attached electrocardiogram (ECG)-depth recorder to a single free-diving whale in Monterey Bay, California. Photo identification and a prior biopsy revealed that this whale was a male, at least 15 y old, first sighted in 2003, and observed previously in Monterey Bay, off Southern California, and in the Gulf of California (Cascadia Research Collective Photo ID Database). We obtained an 8.5-h ECG-depth record from which we constructed the heart rate profile (Fig. 1). The shape of the ECG signal was similar to those recorded in smaller whales in captivity with the same recorder (16). Dive behavior was characteristic of this species (7, 17), with foraging dives as long as 16.5 min and as deep as 184 m. Surface intervals typically ranged from 1 to 4 min. Fig. 1.

(E) Summary of heart rate by activity state and phase of dive for deep foraging dives (color as above). Insets show ECG signals of a blue whale at depth and at the surface with characteristic QRS complexes (ventricular excitation; time from onset of Q wave to end of S wave) and T waves (ventricular relaxation). QRS intervals (361 ± 51.2 ms) and QT intervals (1,021 ± 103.0 ms) were measured for 20 heartbeats at 32 ± 2.0 bpm. The PR interval (atrial excitation and a–v node conduction; time from onset of P wave to onset of R wave) was not calculable, because P waves were not discernible. Based on the measured QT interval (time of ventricular excitation and relaxation; time from onset of Q wave to end of T wave) and an allometrically predicted (25) PR interval of 771 ms in a 70,000-kg animal, the duration of a heart beat at the surface would be about 1.8 s, resulting in an approximate upper limit of 33 bpm for heart rate. This analysis suggests that surface heart rates after deep dives of the blue whale were near maximal. Illustrations courtesy of Alex Boersma (artist). (F) In 60 dives with movement artifact gaps in the ECG record of 9.6 ± 12.0% of total dive duration, dive heart rate and minimum instantaneous heart rate declined with dive duration (black circles, r = 0.31 and blue squares, r = 0.66, respectively), while maximum instantaneous heart rate at the surface increased (green triangles, r = 0.45). The heart rate profile, consistent with the cardiovascular dive response, revealed that beat-to-beat heart rates of 4 to 8 bpm dominated the bottom phase of foraging dives, regardless of dive duration or maximum depth. Dive heart rate (calculated over the entire dive duration) and minimum instantaneous heart rate during a dive decreased with dive duration, while maximum after-dive surface heart rate increased with dive duration (Fig. 1). Based on mammalian allometric equations (18⇓–20), a 70,000-kg whale has a 319-kg heart, a stroke volume (volume of blood ejected per beat) of about 80 L, and a resting heart rate of 15 (bpm). Dive heart rates were below the allometrically predicted resting heart rate of 15 bpm assuming an adult blue whale of average body length (23 m) and an estimated body mass of ∼70,000 kg (21). During the bottom phases of dives, instantaneous heart rates were about 1/3 to 1/2 the predicted resting heart rate. Indeed, most of these bottom-phase heart rates were less than the predicted resting heart rate (11 bpm) for even the largest reported blue whale (200,000 kg) (21). Similar to other divers (1), an increase in heart rate occurred during the ascent of the dive. During surface intervals, heart rates were about twice the predicted resting heart rate and predominantly ranged from 30 to 37 bpm after deep dives (>125-m depth) and from 20 to 30 bpm after shallower dives. Based on the calculated duration of a heartbeat (Fig. 1), blue whales seem to be near maximal heart rate in order to accomplish the necessary respiratory gas exchange and reperfusion of tissues between deep dives. Shallow, short-duration dives at night have been associated with rest (17) and are, therefore, more representative of a less active state. Typical heart rates observed for a 5-min dive (8 bpm) and an accompanying 2-min surface interval (25 bpm) at night would result in a heart rate for both the dive and surface intervals of about 13 bpm, remarkably close to the allometrically predicted 15-bpm rate (19). Heart rate, depth, and relative lung volume profiles of 4 individual dives (Fig. 2) were constructed to examine potential effects of exercise and depth on heart rate regulation. During feeding lunges of deep dives, active stroking of the fluke occurs during the ascent phase of the lunge (feeding occurs at the apex of this ascent), while the descent phase is associated with gliding as the engulfed water mass is purged out of the oropharyngeal cavity (17). The 2.5-fold increase in heart rate during the ascent phase of the lunge feeding and the gradual decrease during the descent phase of the lunge (i.e., filtration phase) parallel these substantial differences in locomotory activity that are characteristic and stereotypical of these foraging dives (17). Such heart rate patterns may reflect modulation of heart rate by exercise (Fig. 2). It is unlikely that pulmonary stretch receptor reflexes contributed to these changes in heart rate, as there were no large changes in relative lung volumes at these depths. However, in the bottom phases of shallow dives, transient increases in heart rate (Fig. 2) were associated with changes in relative lung volume and may have been associated with pulmonary stretch receptor activation as well as changes in locomotory activity, the latter of which was not determined in this study. Fig. 2. Two deep dives (A: a 16.5-min, 176-m dive; B: a 10.5-min, 143-m dive) and 2 shallow dives (C: a 11.0-min, 43-m dive; D, a 7.6-min, 14-m dive) illustrate potential contributions of exercise and pulmonary stretch receptor reflexes to changes in the cardiovascular dive response and heart rate (5, 12, 26). Relative lung volume was calculated as 1/(1 + [depth/10]), with depth in meters. In all cases, the heart rate profiles generally paralleled changes in depth and relative lung volume during descent and ascent. Increases in heart rate during the active ascent phases of feeding lunges of deep dives were not associated with changes in relative lung volume but were more likely related to exercise and the locomotory cost of the lunge. In artifact-free heart rate profiles of 13 lunges during deep dives, heart rate increased 2.5 ± 1.00 times above the before-ascent minima. Peak heart rates during the 13 lunges averaged 8.5 ± 3.53 bpm. During shallow dives, changes in activity as well as in relative lung volume potentially contributed to the increases in heart rate observed during transient ascents during the bottom phases of the dives. The common, often single-beat oscillations in heart rate observed during ascents in all of the dives are typical in other marine mammals and penguins (1).

Discussion Provided that stroke volume was constant, the small increases in heart rate during the feeding lunges of deep dives represented, on average, a transient 2.5-fold maximum increase in cardiac output and peripheral oxygen delivery from the prelunge value. However, average peak heart rates during the lunges were still only about half the predicted value at rest. These data were consistent with the hypothesis that the compliant aortic arches of large balaenopterid whales act as windkessels during the slow heart rates of the dive. Similarly, the range of higher heart rates in the after-dive period supported the hypothesis that aortic impedance and cardiac workload decrease during the surface interval through destructive interference of outgoing and reflected pressure waves in the aorta (14). The extreme bradycardia observed in this study may be unexpected given the high cost of lunge feeding. However, the metabolic cost of a lunge may not be matched to heart rate or convective oxygen transport due in part to the short duration of feeding events and possible recruitment of glycolytic, fast-twitch muscle fibers (22). During a lunge, blue whales accelerate to high speed and engulf a volume of prey-laden water that is larger than their own body (7, 23). The high drag and energy required for lunge feeding have been hypothesized to rapidly deplete total body oxygen stores and limit the dive time available for foraging (7). The mechanical power required to engulf large volumes of water likely far exceeds the aerobic metabolic power available at this body size (6). Although we observed modulation of heart rate during lunges at depth, the distribution of regional blood flow has not been determined during these very transient increases in heart rate. Consequently, the magnitudes of any increases in muscle blood flow, blood oxygen delivery to muscle, and the depletion rate of blood oxygen remain undocumented. Therefore, it is unknown if blood oxygen decreases more rapidly during these transient elevations in heart rate. Indeed, if blood oxygen delivery to muscle remains low or is nil, the metabolic cost of the lunge may be covered primarily by Mb-bound oxygen depletion, phosphocreatine depletion, and glycolysis. In this scenario, muscle oxygen store depletion and lactate accumulation, but not blood oxygen depletion, may contribute most to the relatively short-duration foraging dives of blue whales and other large rorqual whales, despite their large body sizes (7). Much longer foraging dives are regularly observed in other large whale species, such as sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) and bowhead whales (Balaena mysticetus), which exhibit comparatively less costly feeding strategies (24) and also, have higher Mb concentrations (1). Documentation of heart rates during dives now provides a step toward evaluation of oxygen store management in all of these large cetacean species. Regardless of the pattern of blood and muscle oxygen store depletion in blue whales during dives, it seems that near-maximal heart rates are required for gas exchange and reperfusion during their short surface intervals. Because rorqual engulfment capacity exhibits positive allometry (7), whereby larger whales must do relatively more work in less time to feed during a dive, blue whales likely face several physiological constraints during both the dive interval and the surface interval that may have limited the evolution of maximum body size.

Methods and Materials The ECG of the whale was recorded with use of a custom-built ECG recorder/housing (UFI/Meer Instruments) incorporated into a custom suction cup-attached tag (CATS Diary WiFi; Customized Animal Tracking Solutions). Surface ECG electrodes (E-244 electrode; In Vivo Metrics) were embedded in the bases of 2 suction cups (16). The tag was attached with use of a 6-m carbon fiber pole and a 6.3-m inflatable boat in Monterey Bay, California following the tagging procedures described previously (17). Analysis of ECG data followed established protocols described previously (16), with data expressed as mean ± SD.

Titan, a 3-1/2-year-old weighing in at 370 pounds, came to Toledo from the John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He was born at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska to mom, Isabella and dad, Sasha.

The tiger’s transfer was part of an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Species Survival Plan breeding recommendation. Upon acclimation to his new home, Titan will be introduced to Talya, Toledo Zoo’s resident 8-year-old female tiger, with the hope of producing offspring to bolster the population of the feline species.

Amur tigers (Panthera tigris altaica), also known as Siberian tigers, are the world’s largest cats. The species averages 10 feet in length and can weigh 390-660 pounds. Each individual animal has a unique set of stripes that provide crucial camouflage.

Listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List as Endangered, it is believed only 400 Amur tigers remain in a remote temperate forest of Far East Russia. Amur tigers are nocturnal hunters that prey on elk and boar; however, prey is becoming increasingly scarce. Other threats to the species include poaching for illegal wildlife trade and habitat loss.

“Tigers are an iconic species that many look forward to viewing when visiting a zoo and we are eager to work with a young male for the first time in a long time,” said Jeff Sailer, president and CEO of Toledo Zoo. “The mammal staff is already training with Titan and are hopeful for successful breeding. Titan’s transfer is a testament to the importance of the AZA and its participating institutions to ensure future generations can know, love and appreciate Amur tigers.”

A new study says it's basically about how many calories they can take in.That's the conclusion of researchers who used small boats to chase down 300 whales of various species around the world. They reached out with a long pole to attach sensors to the creatures with suction cups, allowing them to record what the animals were doing on their dives for food.The results suggest body size is controlled by how whales capture prey and how much food is available, researchers reported Thursday in the journal Science.The study included 90 blue whales, the biggest animal ever to live. Size estimates vary, but the American Cetacean Society says blue whales can grow about 100 feet long and weigh more than 100 tons. The study also included the biggest whale with teeth, the sperm whale, which can stretch about 60 feet long, the group says.When toothed whales hunt, they capture one prey at a time, seeking them out in the murky depths with a sonar-like detection. The study found that as body size increases in such whales, they become progressively less efficient as they hunt -they recover fewer calories from their meals per calorie burned in each dive. That results from limits on availability of prey.It looks like you cannot be much bigger than a sperm whale when hunting the way it does, said Nicholas Pyenson of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, who was part of the research.The blue whale can be bigger because it feeds in a much different and highly efficient way, the study says. It opens its mouth wide and engulfs an immense volume of water, even bigger than its body size, as it swims along. Then it closes its mouth and strains the water out through a sieve-like filter, which traps huge amounts of tiny shrimp-like creatures called krill.That allows them to exploit a very large prey resource that's very rich in a small amount of time, said Jeremy Goldbogen of Stanford University, another researcher. They get a huge bang for the buck.So why aren't they even bigger than they are? Maybe blue whales are limited by the seasonal nature of the most nutritious krill patches, which grow gigantic and dense in the summer, Goldbogen said. And calculations indicate that to sustain a blue whale that's 115 feet long, you'd need a density of prey that is just not seen anywhere in the world,'' Pyenson said.But maybe there's also some kind of limiting factor in how their bodies function, Goldbogen said. He noted a recent study that found a blue whale's heart beats up to 37 times a minute after deep dives, and that appears to be about as fast as the organ can pump.Another limiting factor could be a whale's ability to process the food it takes in, said Terrie Williams of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who did not participate in the research.The study provided a comprehensive look across big whale species, and the success in collecting the data boggles the mind,'' she said.You try to go out and put a tiny tag on the back of the biggest animal in the world,'' she said.~[]

Newborn giant pandas are tiny compared to their moms.

Giant panda babies are born weirdly tiny and underdeveloped. No one knows why, and the major theory just turned out to be wrong.

Carnivorans — an order of mammals that includes all bears, dogs, cats, raccoons, weasels and seals, among other species — tend to enter the world small, weak, hairless and blind, according to a new paper published Dec. 2 in the Journal of Anatomy. But bears in particular tend to give birth to unusually small cubs.

Some researchers suspect that this oddity has to do with hibernation: At some point, bears started cutting short their pregnancies to avoid gestating while they hibernate, and now that trait is baked into every bear species — even pandas, which don't hibernate. That theory has a big problem though, the authors of the new paper found: Pandas are born exceptionally tiny and underdeveloped, even for bears. And other bears, including species that do hibernate, are born with robust, mature skeletons.

Pink, floppy panda babies are the exception.

""They're basically undercooked,"" Peishu Li, the lead study author, said in a statement. Li was an undergraduate at Duke University at the time of the research and is now a doctoral student at the University of Chicago.

Panda babies are bizarrely tiny. At birth, the cubs weigh just about 3.5 ounces (100 grams), which means that panda mothers are 900 times larger as their babies. Only a handful of other animals, including kangaroos and echidnas, have similar weight differences at birth. Still, it seemed possible that this was part of a universal bear story ; polar bear mothers are 400 times the weight of their newborns. The average mammalian ratio is 1:26.

Newborn pandas are difficult to study. There aren't very many of them in captivity, they're carefully protected and most survive after birth — which means there are few panda cub remains that can be closely analyzed. But in the 1980s, the first panda couple at the Smithsonian National Zoo in Washington, D.C., gave birth to five cubs, all of which died soon after birth.

Li and her co-author, Duke biology professor Kathleen Smith, got their hands on two of those preserved cubs. The researchers used a CT scanner to build 3D models of the unfortunate critters' skeletons. They also scanned newborn grizzlies, sloth bears, polar bears, dogs, a fox and other animals. Comparing all the skeletons, Li and Smith found that pandas appeared to have uniquely under-developed bones at birth — similar to those of a premature beagle puppy they had also studied.

""That would be like a 28-week human fetus,"" Smith said in the statement.

Other bears, though small, are born with skeletons comparable to other related mammal species — with no significant differences based on whether the species hibernates.

Bear pregnancies in general are a bit unusual: The fertilized egg floats around the womb for several months before implanting in the uterine wall to begin development. At that point, most bears take two months to develop, but pandas just take one.

For now, no one knows why. But as the species struggles, the question becomes more urgent, the authors wrote in the study.

Chadwick, the male African lion that lived at the Santa Barbara Zoo for 17 of his 21 years, was humanely euthanized Dec. 5 after a long battle with a degenerative illness.

Chadwick exceeded the life expectancy for lions (16.9 years) in human care by almost five years. He was the oldest male pedigreed lion alive in an Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA)-accredited institution.

“Chadwick has been dealing with health issues associated with his advancing age for several years,” said Dr. Julie Barnes, vice president of animal care and health. “Two weeks ago, he developed lameness in his right forelimb, which rapidly progressed to generalized pain that we suspected was associated with spinal changes. He did not respond to multiple treatments for pain relief.

“Three days ago, we performed a CT scan, which confirmed our suspicion that he had progression of degenerative spinal disease, which is common in geriatric carnivores. Based on his deteriorating condition and his advanced age, the decision was made for humane euthanasia.”

Born at the Indianapolis Zoo in 1998, Chadwick arrived in Santa Barbara in 2003 for the opening of the Cats of Africa exhibit, which also featured black-footed cats. He shared space with female lion Gingerbread, with whom he sired two living offspring during their 14 years together.

At 21, Chadwick was considered geriatric, and had been receiving medical care for ailments typically associated with aging big cats (such as renal failure) for several years.

He had cataract surgery in 2010, and in recent years, the zoo’s animal care staff provided a specialized diet, daily training sessions, and unique enrichment items to keep him as engaged and comfortable as possible.

“Chadwick lived a healthy, active life here at the Santa Barbara Zoo,” said Rich Block, Santa Barbara Zoo president/CEO. “He was well-loved by those who looked after him, and provided a meaningful connection to our guests as a representative for his vulnerable wild counterparts.

“He has been a part of the zoo family for many years, and our staff and volunteers are grieving this significant loss.”

In the wild, many elderly male lions live solitary lives, having been ousted from the pride by younger, stronger males. After the passing of his mate Gingerbread in 2017, Chadwick lived on his own, mirroring this natural stage of lion social structure.

Gingerbread and Chadwick produced two living offspring: Kiki (female), the first African lion ever born at the zoo, was born in 2004, and Docha (male) was born in 2005.

Both Kiki and Docha moved to other zoos as part of the AZA Species Survival Plan, and Kiki has produced two litters.

Plans for more lions to take up residence in Cats of Africa are in the works, and may involve a male-female pair with a breeding recommendation from the AZA. More details will be announced as they become available.

As Santa Barbara Zoo Premier Foster Feeders, the Dreier Family generously sponsored Chadwick since his arrival in 2003.

Anyone wishing to make a gift in memory of Chadwick may consider these options: make a donation to the Santa Barbara Zoo (www.sbzoo.org/support), which funds general operations to support the Zoo’s animals, conservation work and education efforts; or purchase an enrichment item for another zoo animal on the zoo’s Toys4Animals Amazon Wish List."~[]

experimental biologydoi ~"Extremely acute vision and the ability to rapidly process different visual impressions – these two factors are crucial when a peregrine falcon bears down on its prey at a speed that easily matches that of a Formula 1 racing car: over 350 kilometers per hour (~220 MPH).

The visual acuity of birds of prey has been studied extensively and shows the vision of some large eagles and vultures is twice as acute as that of humans. On the other hand, up to now researchers have never studied the speed of vision among birds of prey, i.e. how fast they sense visual impressions.

“This is the first time. My colleague Simon Potier and I have examined the peregrine falcon, saker falcon and Harris’s hawk and measured how fast light can blink for these species to still register the blinks,” says Almut Kelber, professor at the Department of Biology, Lund University.

The results show that the peregrine falcon has the fastest vision and can register 129 Hz (blinks per second) provided the light intensity is high. Under the same conditions, the saker falcon can see 102 Hz and the Harris’s hawk 77 Hz. By comparison, humans see a maximum of 50-60 Hz. At the cinema, a speed of 25 images per second is sufficient for us to perceive it as film, and not as a series of still images.

The speed at which the different birds of prey process visual impressions corresponds with the needs they have when hunting: the peregrine falcon hunts fast-flying birds, whereas the Harris’s hawk hunts small, slower mammals on the ground.

Even though the vision speed of birds of prey has never been measured before, there are studies about the speed at which small insect-eating birds such as flycatchers and blue tits can take in visual impressions.

“They also have fast vision. Therefore, we draw the conclusion that bird species that hunt prey that flies fast have the fastest vision. Evolution has provided them with the ability because they need it,” says Almut Kelber.

“It is something of a competition. A fly flies quite fast and has fast vision, therefore the flycatcher must see the fly quickly in order to catch it. The same applies to the falcon. To capture a flycatcher, the falcon must detect its prey sufficiently early in order to have time to react”, says Simon Potier.

The new knowledge can hopefully contribute to better conditions for birds held in captivity.

“Those who keep birds in cages must take care with the lighting and use cage lighting that does not shimmer, flicker or blink, because the birds will not feel well,” concludes Almut Kelber.

An Amur tiger and two Mexican grey wolves are getting acquainted with their new habitat.

The 4-year-old female tiger, Zoya, is from Odense Zoo in Denmark and is the first tiger to come to the zoo since Hector arrived in 2017. The addition of Zoya is significant because Amur tigers are endangered in the wild with an estimated population of only 500.

Zoya will gradually be introduced to one of four interconnected habitats in the zoo’s Rosebrough Tiger Passage.

The zoo has also welcomed another endangered species—two Mexican grey wolves. Both wolves, Meraki and Sarra, are female and were born from the same litter in 2018.

They came to Cleveland from The Endangered Wolf Center which specializes in care for endangered wolf species.

These wolves were eliminated across the US by the 1970s, but have been slowly recovering through partnerships like the Endangered Wolf Center and the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.

Now you can spot tigers in the lion safari at Renuka soon as the wild life wing of Himachal Pradesh forest department has contacted as many as three zoos and biological parks to get a pair of tigers in the sanctuary that was earlier popular for propagating Asiatic lions.

Decision to move tigers into the lion sanctuary comes after the last Asiatic lion died four years ago. The wild wing department has moved a proposal under animal exchange programme seeking a pair of lions and a pair of tigers for Renuka sanctuary. “We have got approval from the Central Zoo Authority of India (CZAI) to build enclosures for tigers in Renuka lion safari,” said divisional forest officer wildlife Rajesh Sharma.

Wild life department proposes to get a pair of lions from the Zoological Park in Gandhinagar (Gujarat) while the pair of tigers has been proposed to be brought from Bannerghatta National Park in Karnataka.

INBREEDING PROBLEMS

Asiatic lions in Renuka Safari once grew fast and steady. However, in the later years their population gradually declined because of inbreeding problems.

Renuka Safari considered as the first zoo in Himachal Pradesh was set up in 1957 with caging animals that strayed in the human habitations.

ZOO’S HISTORY

Initially, the sanctuary came up as mini zoo and later on many endangered species were introduced in here.

Many species like hog dear, barking dear, chinkara, blackbuck and others were added gradually. With passing times, their population grew. To accommodate increasing number of animals, an open park was set up in 1983.

Animals like blackbuck, Neelgai (blue bull) were brought from Piplee Zoo in Uttar Pradesh. A pair of Asiatic lions was brought to Renuka Zoo from Junagarh in Uttar Pradesh in 1975. The first lion was named Raja while the lioness was known as Rani.

DECLINE IN LION POPULATION

With the passage of time, lions multiplied and their population grew, however, in recent times lions at the sanctuary faced inbreeding problems. Consequently, genetically new born faced high mortality rate. The lions that were first introduced from Gir sanctuary, known for Asiatic lions, diminished. There was a time when their count rose to more than 40.

ANIMAL EXCHANGE PROGRAMME

Under the animal exchange programme, Himachal Pradesh government will provide a pair of black beers, barking deers and sambhars that have multiplied fast and are doing good in different zoos run by the state government.

The government has sent a proposal to central zoo authority to rehabilitate a pair of tigers from Bennarghatta National Park, 26 kilometers from Benguluru.

The park houses animals like jaguars, leopards, lions, tiger and Asiatic elephants. The sanctuary is also home to many feline researchers."~[]

“Between April and October 2019, nine rhinos were killed. The unfortunate incidents have increased with 13 more rhinos having been poached from October to date,” the ministry said in a statement seen by Reuters late on Monday.

Despite heavy rhino poaching in neighboring South Africa, which has one of the world’s largest rhino populations, only six rhinos were killed for their horns in Botswana between 2007 and 2017 conversation organization Save the Rhino said on its website.

The actual size of the Botswana rhino population is kept a secret by government officials but the Department of Wildlife and National Parks Rhino Coordinator, Dr. Mmadi Reuben said in October that if the poaching ‘continued at this rate there will be no rhinos in Botswana in a year or two, especially the black rhino, a critically endangered species’.

Botswana is believed to have benefited in 2015 when South Africa moved around 100 rhinos to neighboring countries as part of efforts to stem the illicit slaughter of the animals for their horns.

Widely regarded as a safe haven for wildlife, Botswana has a strict anti-poaching policy and says it has committed immense resources to combat poaching but poachers have taken advantage of the large size of the Okavango Delta and its difficult wetland terrain.

Botswana said it has stepped up efforts to address poaching with interventions leading to the recovery of some horns and hunting weapons.

Since it was established as China’s first national park for the endangered species in 2017, the park has seen 10 wild Siberian tiger cubs newly bred, said Liang Zhuo, a veteran tiger expert.

He said he now worries about his personal safety when making field trips to the park as the number of the big carnivores has increased.

Spanning an area of over 1.46 million hectares in the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang, the park covers long stretches of mountain forests.

The 10 tiger cubs were born to the original 27 wild Siberian tigers living in the area. The habitats of the endangered species are mostly distributed in the Russian Far East and the northeast China region.

China has been intensifying the efforts to save the wild animals through the protection of their natural forest habitat, including the introduction of a logging ban in 2014.

The national park bordering Russia and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has created a natural corridor for the wild species to traverse, said Liang.

The national park administration has set up infrared cameras to monitor the activities of the wild animals. Wardens make regular patrols in the park and replace batteries and memory cards in the cameras.

With the protection efforts, the number of black bears, wild boars, roe deer and other animals in the mountain area has also increased. The park administration found the density of wild boar in 2018 was 1.91 per square km, an increase of 1.34 over 2011. Wild boar and deer are the staple food of wild Siberian tigers.

Jiang Guangshun, executive deputy director of the Feline Research Center of the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, said tigers are at the top of the food chain. The tiger’s revival suggests that the food chain is complete in the national park with forest resources being restored."~[]

The female calf, which has not been named yet, is the 24th such rhino to be born in the zoo. It is also the 12th calf born to its 34-year-old mother Donsa.

Donsa and the calf's father, Hoepel, arrived in the Singapore Zoo from South Africa in 1992 and 2000 respectively.

""(The baby) is quickly getting her footing and growing stronger,"" the Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) said in a video it posted on Facebook on Friday.

Members of the public are unable to see Donsa and her baby calf yet, but zoo visitors can meet the calf's father Hoepel and other white rhinos during their daily feeding session at 1.15pm.

White rhinos have been among the animals in the WRS' attractions since 1972.

The WRS started breeding the species in 1996.

Since then, 17 rhinos have taken part in overseas zoos' breeding programmes in Australia, India, Indonesia, Korea and Thailand.

""The combined effort of successful conservation breeding programmes has allowed the species, which was once in serious threat from extinction, to make a successful comeback, and it is now relatively stable in the wild,"" the WRS said.

White rhinos are considered near threatened in the wild on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened species. They are poached for their horns, which some believe as having medicinal properties.

They got their name partly by mistake - the English word ""white"" is said to have been derived by mistranslation of the Dutch word ""wijd"", which means ""wide"" in English.

The word ""wide"" refers to the mouths of white rhinos, which are also known as square-lipped rhinos.

Together with the Indian rhino, it is the largest species of land mammal after the elephant."~[]

A highly trained team of 13 professionals including two specialist veterinary dentists, a veterinary anaesthetist, dental nurse, radiographer and eight experienced carnivore keepers came together to perform a complex root canal procedure on the world’s largest species of cat.

While many people dread a trip to the dentist, on this occasion, the dentist had more reason to be wary of the patient, a 193kg Amur Tiger at Knowsley Safari .

Jen Quayle, the vet at Knowsley Safari, explains: “Kuzma arrived at the Safari last summer and we’re hopeful he’ll breed with female Amur Tigers as part of conservation efforts. We’re regularly checking on his health and welfare and a routine examination revealed the need for treatment on his teeth.

“The procedure involved a lot of preparation. The anaesthetic keeps Kuzma comfortable and meant the treatment could be carried out safely. Amur Tigers can live in temperatures as low as -40°C, but the process of anaesthesia naturally stops Kuzma regulating his temperature. We created bubble wrap mittens and used duvets to keep Kuzma warm.”

Watch as we meet the Rhinos at Knowsley Safari.

During the procedure a portable dental x-ray was used to assess all of Kuzma’s teeth, which revealed he had a broken root in one of his cheek teeth. This wasn’t apparent on visual examination and was removed to prevent any further pain. The whole process followed similar techniques used for human dental surgery but was scaled up for the big cat.

Jen Quayle concludes: “Tiger’s teeth are a bit like icebergs. The tooth that you see above the gum is just part of the story. The canine tooth’s root runs much deeper into the gum and in a tiger, as much as two thirds of the tooth is hidden inside the jawbone. The total length of the canines is nearly 10cm – about five times as long as a human’s canine root canal. The procedure meant we didn’t have to resort to more intrusive surgery, while relieving Kuzma of any pain and making it much more comfortable for him during mealtimes.

“Kuzma has responded really well and quickly tucked into his tea not long after the procedure.”"~[]

Wrong. New research shows that some pandas just aren't capable clamberers (and the video evidence is adorable).

Researchers evaluated the climbing skills of young giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) as part of a captive rearing and release program at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in China. The team found that not all pandas can climb, and the best climbers make use of their head to help shinny up the tree, said Andrew Schulz, a conservation physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

The study was a scientific collaboration between researchers at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Schulz presented the team's research here at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology meeting on Saturday (Jan. 4).

Pandas are weird for several reasons, he said, but one reason is that their body shape doesn't resemble that of any of the other seven bear species that exist. Instead, the panda body shape is more like that of a corgi, or even a hippo — they all have a very large body and large head with relatively short, stout legs. Animals with that body shape aren't known to climb trees, yet pandas can climb trees. (Well, some of them, at least.) But until now, scientists had never systematically judged how, or how well, these lovable bears could climb.

""It’s very odd that [pandas] are such good climbers because of their body shape,"" Schulz said.

Schulz and his colleague, Rose Zhao, watched eight precious, 1-year-old panda cubs climb bare tree trunks in a captive enclosure. The researchers discovered that some of the pandas were really great climbers while others were just terrible at it. The pandas that were better climbers figured out how to use their head to grip the tree in order to climb, which is not something other animals do, Schulz said. And, hugging the tree with their head helped keep the panda's center of gravity directly above their rear legs, which gave them more stability as they climbed. Human rock climbers aim to keep their bodies close to the rocks and directly above their feet while hugging the climbing wall for the same reason.

Climbing is an important skill for pandas that are going to make it in the wild. (Image credit: Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding/Georgia Institute of Technology)

The giant panda is China's national treasure, and the species is considered vulnerable to extinction under the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . One of the main threats to the panda's survival is the population of feral dogs that roam the forests where pandas live. Packs of dogs will hunt pandas; and if even if the dogs don't succeed in killing a panda, they can transfer diseases to the bears. These large bears aren't particularly agile or swift creatures, so their primary escape route is up. If they can't make it up a tree, they will get injured or killed, so climbing is an important skill for a panda.

The panda cubs at the Chengdu Panda Base that are most skilled at activities like climbing, eating and walking are more likely to survive in the wild and therefore are good candidates for release. It's still unclear if these baby pandas are capable of learning to climb as they age. So, Schulz and his colleagues plan to revisit these same panda cubs next year to see if any of the adorable black-and-white floofs that were having trouble climbing have managed to figure it out.

The female tiger, Taj, fills a void left in November, when 15-year-old Amur tiger Lana was euthanized following months of treatment for liver disease. Taj came to Duluth from the Potawatomi Zoo in South Bend, Ind.

“Everything fell into place; South Bend had too many tigers,” Dave Thompson, director of animal management, said during a news conference. “So, (it was) a little bit of luck, but also a little bit of planning as well.”

Taj was born in March 2013 at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio, and was a parent-reared animal. Her predecessor, Lana, was born at the Minnesota Zoo in Apple Valley and human-reared, and there is a difference. Taj will only be viewable from the upper balcony for now until she is acclimated to crowds, who often view the tiger exhibit through a lower-level observation glass.

“Human-reared animals are always going to look at people as the people who raised them,” said Lizzy Larson, primary carnivore keeper. “They almost look at them as tigers in human form. So they are a lot more relaxed around humans.

“Taj, on the other hand, having been raised by her mom, is a tiger. She’s a tiger-tiger. She’s 100 percent tiger. So she is a little bit more uncomfortable with people. So we want to give her space and make sure she has time to acclimate.”

The goal, for now, is to keep the 300-pound tiger from having eye-level contact with visitors, making for a less threatening environment. Eventually, the lower-level observation window will be available.

Amur tigers have a lifespan of 10 to 15 years in the wild and 15 to 20 in a zoological facility. It’s estimated there are 350 to 500 of the animals in the wild, mostly in their native southeast region of Russia, with smaller numbers in China and North Korea.

Since her arrival Jan. 7, Taj has proven to love the snow and enjoy “boomer balls” — hard toys she rolls around with.

“(She) is perfectly suited for the weather here in Minnesota,” Larson said.

Taj is the fourth tiger to call the Lake Superior Zoo home.

“Obviously, Lana was a fantastic tiger; she had a lot of personality,” Larson said. “Taj has equal amounts of personality, but just might be displaying it slightly differently than Lana did. She was parent-reared so she has a little bit more feistiness to her, but she is a fantastic animal to have here.”"~[]

During rut, males can become quite restless because of their endless searching and surging hormones. Tian Tian is no different and he has days when he can’t seem to settle, despite multiple feedings and enrichment opportunities. Although they are mostly solitary animals, giant pandas do communicate with other pandas through scent. Scent marks convey a lot of valuable information to and from panda neighbors. It communicates the sex, age and reproductive status of the panda who left it.

As Mei Xiang and Tian Tian explore different yards, they spend much of their time smelling each other’s scent marks and leaving some of their own. Indoors, they have been exploring Bei Bei’s former enclosure, and Tian has even decided to nap in the elevated hammock.

We were looking forward to the first measurable snowfall of the season and it finally arrived Jan. 7! Although Washington, D.C., got just under an inch of snow, it brought out the playful sides of both Mei Xiang and Tian Tian. The morning after the snowfall, they rolled down hills, climbed trees and dangled upside down out of the tree branches — just like they did in their younger years!"~[]

northern white rhinos in Kenya and was able to create a new embryo over Christmas.

In August 2019 a team of scientists and conservationists broke new ground in saving the northern white rhinoceros from extinction. They harvested eggs from the two remaining females, artificially inseminated those using frozen sperm from deceased males and created two viable northern white rhino embryos. With great support from the Kenyan Government and in the presence of Hon Najib Balala, – Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary, Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife – the team repeated the procedure on December 17, 2019, and was able to create a new embryo over Christmas. This significantly increases the chances of successfully producing offspring. The procedure has proven to be safe and reproducible, and can be performed on a regular basis before the animals become too old. Preparations for the next steps of the northern white rhino rescue mission are underway.

Four months after the ground breaking first “ovum pickup” in August 2019, the team repeated the procedure with northern white rhinos Najin and Fatu on December 17, 2019, at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. The animals were placed under general anesthetic and nine immature egg cells (oocytes) – three from Najin and six from Fatu – were harvested from the animals’ ovaries using a probe guided by ultrasound. The anesthesia and the ovum pickup went smoothly and without any complications. The oocytes were transported immediately to the Avantea Laboratory in Italy. After incubating and maturing nine eggs, four from Fatu and one from Najin were fertilized with sperm using a procedure called ICSI (Intra Cytoplasm Sperm Injection). One out of five eggs from Fatu fertilized with semen from Suni developed into a viable embryo with the help of Geri®, an innovative benchtop incubator with integrated continuous embryo monitoring capabilities designed to provide an individualized and undisturbed incubation environment, donated by Merck. The embryo is now stored in liquid nitrogen along with the two embryos from the first procedures.

Honorable Najib Balala, Cabinet Secretary for Kenya’s Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife: “As a government, we are glad that the northern white rhino in-vitro fertilization project by a consortium of scientists and conservationists from Kenya, Czech Republic, Germany and Italy collaborative partnership has been able to successfully produce three pure northern white rhino embryos ready for implantation into southern white rhino as surrogate mothers in coming months. This is a big win for Kenya and its partners, as the northern white rhinos are faced with the threat of imminent extinction, where only two of them, females Najin and Fatu, are left in the whole world and are currently hosted by Kenya. It’s a delicate process, and for that, we thank the concerned parties, the Kenya Wildlife Service, Ol Pejeta Conservancy, Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Avantea Laboratory and Dvůr Králové Zoo, for putting in all of their efforts in ensuring that the critically endangered species do not disappear from the planet under our watch. I urge the scientists to continue digging deeper into technology and innovations to ensure that not only this concerned species does not go extinct, but other species that are faced with similar threats. The fact that Kenya is at the center of this scientific breakthrough also makes me very proud. It’s amazing to see that we will be able to reverse the tragic loss of this subspecies through science.”

Preparations for the next steps of the mission for saving the northern white rhino from extinction are underway simultaneously to the creation of embryos. The plan is to select a group of southern white rhinos at Ol Pejeta Conservancy from which a female could serve as surrogate mother for the northern white rhino embryo. To achieve the best possible results for work with pure northern white rhino embryos, the team relies on experience from similar embryo transfer procedures in southern white rhinos that have been performed in order to address reproduction challenges in European zoos. Despite the fact that more research is still needed, the team expects that a first attempt for this crucial, never before achieved step, may be undertaken in 2020.

In December 2019, the team also transported the semen of Sudan, the last northern white rhino male that died in March 2018, from Kenya to Germany. The aim is to use it in future for production of more embryos. However, as the semen was collected in 2014 when Sudan was already over 40 years old, it is necessary to test it first and then see whether it could be used for such purposes.

The egg collection, embryo creation and preparation for the embryo transfer is a joint effort by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (Leibniz-IZW), Avantea, Dvůr Králové Zoo, Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). The entire process is part of the “BioRescue” research. Its goal is to significantly advance assisted reproduction techniques (ART) and stem cell associated techniques (SCAT) complemented with a comprehensive ethical assessment carried out by the University of Padova for the benefit of the northern white rhinoceros. The consortium is partially funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and comprises of internationally renowned institutions from Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Kenya, Japan and USA.

Quotes

Thomas Hildebrandt, Head Department of Reproduction Management, Leibniz-IZW: “Our repeated success in generating a third embryo from Fatu demonstrates that the BioRescue program is on the right track. Now, the team will make every effort to achieve the same result for the 30-year-old Najin before it is too late for her. We are strongly committed to our plan to transfer a northern white embryo into a surrogate mother in 2020 to ensure the survival of the northern white rhino.”

Jan Stejskal, Director of International Projects, Dvůr Králové Zoo: “We don’t know how many embryos we will need to achieve a successful birth of a new northern white rhino calf. That’s why every embryo is so important and why a long-term cooperation between scientists, experts in zoos and conservationists in field is a crucial element if we want to give hope to a species that would otherwise go extinct in few years.”

Cesare Galli, Director, Avantea: “Having produced another embryo again from Fatu and none from Najin indicates that we cannot waste more time as aging of the animals is not a favorable condition.”

Richard Vigne, Managing Director, Ol Pejeta Conservancy: “We have taken yet another small step along the road of saving the northern white rhino from extinction. We have a long way to go and success is far from assured, but Kenya continues to play her part at the center of a multi-national collaboration to save this species. Let us hope for news of a successful northern white pregnancy in the not too distant future”

Brig (Rtd) John Waweru, Kenya Wildlife Service Director General: “We are thrilled at the two successful ovum pick-ups and the subsequent creation of embryos which together mark crucial milestones in the ambitious race to save the majestic Northern White Rhino species from imminent and irreversible extinction. We are delighted at the steady progress every time such a step is made. The more than decade-long journey Kenya has walked as part of an international collaborative rescue mission is a strong testament to what can be achieved when humanity comes together in a collaborative approach. We remain upbeat at the prospects of the groundbreaking efforts to revive the Northern White Rhino from disappearing from the planet. Kenya Wildlife Service reiterates her commitment to the partnership contributing to this historic initiative that’s pushing the frontiers of science.”

Barbara de Mori, Director of the Ethics Laboratory for Veterinary Medicine, Conservation and Animal Welfare – University of Padua: “Like the previous ones, even this new embryo has been created under a rigorous ethical assessment of all procedures involved, taking care of the welfare of Najin and Fatu in all aspects. All the stakeholders involved participated in the ethical assessment, confirming the importance to carry on with this project in order to give the two northern white rhino females a chance to rise their offspring and hopefully save their species.”

Jan Kirsten, Head of Global Business Franchise for Fertility, Merck: “It’s a privilege to support the mission to save the world’s most endangered mammal with our expertise and world-leading technologies. We are excited that a viable, Northern White Rhino embryo has developed with the help of our Geri incubator.”

Steven Seet, Head Public Relations, Leibniz-IZW: “The additional embryo is a remarkable success. The worldwide public awareness of our conservation research is very important. Media and people show that they care about nature. We hope that supporters will contact us directly to be part of the endeavor of saving the northern white rhinos from extinction.”"~[]

The northern white rhino came closer to extinction in 2018 when the last known living male died in Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy. The only surviving northern white rhinos now are a mother and daughter, which also live at the site, making them the world’s most endangered mammal.

Researchers collected sperm from male rhinos before their deaths and developed three embryos using eggs collected from the two living females last year. They plan to implant the embryos in female southern white rhinos, which are more populous.

“Despite the fact that more research is still needed, the team expects that a first attempt for this crucial, never before achieved step, may be undertaken in 2020,” Ol Pejeta Conservancy said in a statement.

In addition to Ol Pejeta, the team behind the effort includes Kenya Wildlife Services, Italian-based Avantea Lab, which has the embryos in its custody, Dvůr Králové Zoo in the Czech Republic, and German-based Leibniz Institute for Zoo & Wildlife Research.

“We are glad that the northern white rhino in-vitro fertilization project ... has been able to successfully produce three pure northern white rhino embryos ready for implantation,” Tourism and Wildlife Minister Najib Balala said.

“This is a big win for Kenya and its partners, as the northern white rhinos are faced with the threat of imminent extinction.”

The northern white rhino was once found in several countries in east and central Africa but, as with other rhino species, its numbers fell sharply due to heavy poaching.

The International Rhino Foundation estimates there are roughly 18,000 southern white rhinos surviving, mostly in South Africa. It puts the total number of black rhinos at about 5,500.

Kenya, which was home to as many as 20,000 rhinos in the 1970s, now has about 650, mostly black rhinos."~[]

Biologists are trying to figure out ways on how to prevent the extinction of the critically endangered Northern White Rhinoceros. This subspecies of the White Rhinoceros is formerly abundant in several countries in East and Central Africa and south of the Sahara desert. Unlike the other subspecies, the Southern White Rhinoceros, this subspecies prefer grazing in the grasslands and savannas. As of March of 2018, there are only two known Northern White Rhinoceros existing in the world and both are females. Najin, the older of the two, is born in captivity and the other one is her daughter Fatu. Since both females were born in captivity, the Northern White Rhinoceros is declared extinct in the wild.

Decades-worth of poaching has taken its toll on the White Rhinos, especially its two subspecies. Rhinoceros are being killed for their horns which are then sold in the black market to become Chinese traditional medicine. Also, the demand for rhinoceros horns in the black market increases as it becomes a status symbol to display success and wealth. To make matters worse, international criminal organizations are supplying poachers with sophisticated equipment to be able to find and kill rhinos. The most common practice among poachers is to use tranquilizer guns to bring down the poor animal and then remove their horns leaving the animal bleeding to death. Because of the dwindling population of the rhinoceros, collectors are becoming more and more aggressive in trying to get their hands on rhino horns which is unfortunate for the critically endangered (and practically extinct in the wild) animal.

Nevertheless, scientists offered good news in the attempt to save the subspecies at the start of a new decade as they claimed to have successfully created another embryo of the Northern White Rhinoceros. This embryo is the third one to be created in a laboratory and was made possible by harvesting eggs from Fatu, the younger Northern White Rhinoceros, and inseminated it with frozen sperm from dead males of the species. These embryos were then stored in liquid nitrogen and will be transferred to a surrogate mother (preferably a Southern White Rhino) in the following months. In a statement by the Kenya Wildlife Service, wildlife minister Najib Balala expresses excitement on the possibilities of success from this project. Balala says it is amazing to see that the extinction of the subspecies can be reversed with the help of science.

The project's ultimate goal is to be able to create a herd of at least five animals that will be returned to their natural habitats in Africa. But, of course, it will not be easy and may take decades to be accomplished. According to Thomas Hildebrandt of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Germany, the team will make every effort to achieve the same results with Najin, the older Northern White Rhinoceros.

Researchers are sure that the procedure is safe for the rhinos and can be performed regularly before the females become too old to produce healthy egg cells. The next step after harvesting egg cells is to find a surrogate mother among Southern White Rhinos housed at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya."~[]

On 11 September 2019, scientists from the Avantea laboratory in Italy announced that they had successfully created two Northern white rhino embryos. With only two females surviving of the subspecies, this development is a huge step for Northern white rhinos. In January 2020, those involved with the project announced that another embryo had been successfully created in December 2019. All three embryos now remain frozen under liquid nitrogen.

The embryos were created using eggs from one of the last two of the subspecies (Fatu), after five oocytes (egg cells) were harvested in August 2019 from both Fatu and her mother Najin, the last two Northern white rhinos remaining, who live out their days at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. Neither Najin nor Fatu are able to carry a pregnancy to full term due to age and / or reproductive tract issues.

In this successful fertilisation, scientists at Avantea laboratory matured seven of the eggs in vitro (in a culture dish). The eggs were then injected with sperm cells from two deceased Northern white rhino bulls. The scientists working on the project have stated that two eggs (and in December 2019 a third egg) developed into the blastocyst (early embryo) stage. The next step for this process is to transfer the eggs into a surrogate Southern white rhino at a later date, in the hope that a new Northern white calf will eventually be born.

This is the first time that scientists have been able to produce embryos for Northern white rhinos using in vitro fertilisation (IVF); it is a significant achievement. The next step for these embryos will be a major hurdle: developing a viable pregnancy with a surrogate Southern white rhino has not yet been achieved.

This project has been underway for a number of years, with partners from science and conservation around the world (Germany, Kenya, the United States, the Czech Republic and Italy). Knowledge is gained with each new development, however, we remain a long way away from having a viable (>20 unrelated animals) population of Northern white rhinos.

Using Advanced Reproductive Technologies (ART) to “bring back” the Northern white rhino is a complex, highly difficult endeavour, and creating early-stage embryos is one step on a long journey. We hope that this research brings forward a wealth of information to benefit other rhino species.

All five species continue to be threatened by intense poaching and habitat loss. Only by using a mixture of strategies will we reduce these threats. Developing high-tech reproductive science is one approach; for the Northern white subspecies, ART is the only remaining option.

However, to secure a future for other Critically Endangered species of rhino, the Sumatran and Javan rhino, in particular, our primary focus must be to reduce the current threats, so that no other rhino species dips to such low numbers that IVF and / or ARTs are the only option."~[]

U.S. Magistrate Judge Daniel Albregts also sentenced Buchanan to two years of probation and 40 hours of community service. Buchanan had previously pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor Endangered Species Act count for his interstate sale of the threatened rhinoceros.

According to court documents, in June 2014, a prospective buyer in Minnesota emailed Buchanan about the prospect of purchasing a southern white rhinoceros half-mount.

By June 23, 2014, Buchanan and the prospective buyer negotiated and planned the sale of the rhinoceros mount for $6,500.

On that day, Buchanan emailed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Division of Management Authority (FWS) to inquire about the legality of selling the rhinoceros mount.

The FWS responded to Buchanan’s inquiry that the rhinoceros mount “may be, including a transfer, donation, or exchange, only for noncommercial purposes. Thus, sale after import is prohibited.”

On June 30, 2014, the prospective buyer arrived in Las Vegas, rented a moving truck and, together with Buchanan, drove to Buchanan’s residence where he was storing the rhinoceros mount. They loaded the rhinoceros mount, which was made with real rhino hide and horns, into the moving truck and the buyer drove to his home in Minnesota.

Several days after the sale, Buchanan sent the buyer a Transfer of Ownership Note that falsely characterized the transfer of the rhinoceros mount as,” not for purposes of sale, but an in-kind donation of property.”

Rhinoceros horns have been in extremely high demand in Southeast Asia during the last several years. Rhinoceros horn, to which people mistakenly attribute medicinal value and which is also seen as a symbol of status and prosperity, have sold for as much as $25,000 a pound. The horns from Buchanan’s mount could have sold for more than $435,000. Illegal sale of rhino parts fuel the lucrative black market and indirectly contribute to the illegal take of rhinos in the wild.

This investigation began with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agents based at the Office of Law Enforcement RAC Office in St. Paul, Minnesota. The prosecution of this case was handled by U.S. Department of Justice Environmental Crimes Section Trial Attorney Matthew Evans and Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadia Ahmed for the District of Nevada."~[]

The BioRescue team, including researchers based at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Germany, extracted egg cells from the ovaries of the last two remaining northern white rhino females. They then artificially fertilized the eggs using sperm taken from now-deceased male rhinos and stored the embryos in liquid nitrogen. The team managed to create two embryos in September 2019 and has recently created a third.

“Before the BioRescue team came, no one had ever created an embryo from a northern white rhino except for the rhino itself,” Steven Seet, Head Public Relations & International Affairs at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, told me. “This species is functionally extinct. Nevertheless, we have achieved the production of a third embryo now. This is incredible.”

As the last two females are unable to become pregnant, the plan now is to implant the embryos into surrogate female southern white rhinos, a distinct subspecies, in the coming months. “Every additional embryo increases the probability of getting a pregnancy … The more, the better!” Seet said.

There are many technical challenges remaining before the team can save the Northern White Rhino from extinction. First of all, it will need a lot more than three embryos to rebuild a healthy population. To meet this challenge, the team is developing technology to transform stem cells from northern white rhino skin tissue into egg and sperm cells. “Our Japanese cooperation partner succeeded in doing so in a mouse model,” Seet said. “We are adapting this to the rhinos.”

A second challenge may lie in implanting a northern white rhino embryo into a surrogate southern white rhino mother, which might have compatibility issues.

“It might be that there are epigenetic components involved as the biological system of the southern rhinos might differ from the northern,” Seet told me. “A possible assessment of this could be conducted when we have the first calves on the ground. This is further research then.”

Also involved in the BioRescue project was the German big pharma Merck KGaA, which donated a specialized incubator where the egg cells could be fertilized with monitoring by HD cameras.

“Merck has donated access to its innovative fertility technologies to Project BioRescue to give this challenge the best possible chance of success and protect the Northern White Rhino from extinction,” Jan Kirsten, Merck’s Head of Global Business Franchise for Fertility, told me. “While there is a long way to go on this journey, we hope these steps will pave the way for this technique to potentially be used in other species.”

According to Kirsten and Seet, the biotechnology industry will likely play a strong role in the conservation of endangered species in the coming years. However, argued Seet, reproductive medicine and stem cell technology should remain a last resort to save a species.

“It would be better to react much earlier to avoid using the BioRescue technology,” he said. “Humans must learn from this best practice project and evaluate biodiversity and conserve it.”

The eight-week-old calf, named Future, accompanied her mother, Amani, spent time exploring the habitat and running around the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center before taking a nap, according to zoo officials.

The pair has been living in the maternity yard and other off-exhibit areas while keepers got the baby bulked up and ready for the larger space. Future weighted 132 pounds when she was born the week before Thanksgiving. She was up to 386 pounds as of Jan. 17.

While Future is one of 100 southern white rhinos to be born at the Safari Park, the calf is only the second one in North America to be born hormone-induced ovulation and artificial insemination. Officials with San Diego Zoo Global said the name Future celebrates that process and the hope she brings to the future of rhino conservation worldwide.

There are only two northern white rhinos left in the world, and both are female. Future’s birth by artificial insemination represents a critical step in the organization’s ongoing work to develop the scientific knowledge required to genetically recover the northern white rhino, a distant subspecies of the southern white rhino, the zoo said.

The yet-to-be-named female calf is the offspring of Kidogo.

According to the World Wildlife Foundation, white rhinos were believed to have gone extinct in the late 19th century due to poachers killing the rhinos for their tusks. Currently, there are about 20,000 white rhinos in existence.

Poaching and destruction of their wildlife habitats continue to be the major causes of mortality. Record numbers of rhinos have been killed by poachers due to the high demand for keratin, a protein found in rhino horn that is believed to have medicinal properties. The northern white rhino, a relative of the southern white rhino, is now considered extinct in the wild, with only two remaining in professional care.

ZooTampa participates in the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Rhino Taxon Advisory Group, which includes the Southern White Rhino Species Survival Plan. Over the past 20 years, ZooTampa has contributed $100,000 to conservation projects, such as anti-poaching and habitat repair and restoration efforts in Africa.

The majority of southern white rhinos live in just four countries in Africa: Kenya, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. They are characterized by a pronounced hump and two horns at the ends of their muzzles, used to defend against predators and establish social dominance.



Guests may catch a glimpse of the rhino calf in the African section on the zoo's safari tram ride, included with daily admission. To get an even closer look, guests can also add on a white rhino encounter starting at $10.

The zoo is located at 1101 W. Sligh Ave. in Tampa, and is open seven days a week from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. with extended hours for select events. Parking is free."~[]

Nor do they know boundaries.

Human greed and ignorance know no bounds. Nor do they know boundaries. Across Asia tigers are routinely killed so their parts can be used in traditional Chinese medicine.

Meanwhile in Africa a similar fate can befall the continent’s lions. To wit: 16 lions were recently butchered by poachers in South Africa, then the animals’ snouts and claws were hacked off so they could be sold as ingredients for traditional medicine and black magic.

Among the dead lions were eight cubs and two pregnant lionesses.

“They had hacked off 32 paws for the claws and eight of their snouts for their teeth after killing them with poisoned chicken, which is a really agonising death for the lions,” lamented Gert Blom, a rancher who owns Predators Rock Bush Lodge in the country’s North West province where the lions were kept.

“It is cruelty that is beyond belief and an absolutely terrible sight to behold when you see magnificent predators [butchered like this],” he added.

Sadly, such savagery perpetrated against Africa’s beleaguered lions is hardly uncommon. Just like tigers and other big cats, African lions have seen their numbers plummet in recent decades. Only some 25,000 mature lions remain in the wild across Africa, down from at least twice as many just a quarter century ago. Worse: three quarters of Africa lion populations are in continued decline.

Habitat loss, poaching and trophy hunting have all taken their toll on the majestic predators. Lions are routinely poisoned by people who want to protect themselves or their livestock from them. They are also killed for their teeth, claws and other body parts to be used in witchcraft and traditional medicine. Each year some 600 wild lions are killed.

Making matters worse, over the past decades the iconic predators have lost 94% of their historic range. “[T]he range and population of the African Lion will drastically decrease and it is highly likely to become Endangered if conservation measures are not successful at reversing current trends in the near future,” warns the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.

The predators have already disappeared in 26 range states across the continent Africa. “Only a few countries, such as Tanzania, Kenya, Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa, harbor populations of at least 1,000 lions,” The Hill observes. “The lynch pin in the ecology of the African savanna walks on the tightrope of survival.”

“Lions are truly one of the world’s universal icons, and they are quietly slipping away,” stresses Paul Thomson, director of conservation programs for the Wildlife Conservation Network. “Now is the time to stop the loss and bring lions back to landscapes across the continent.”

Encouragingly, conservation efforts are underway to save Africa’s remaining wild lions. Among those efforts are initiatives aimed at ensuring that people in rural communities can coexist with wild lions. Villagers and herders get compensated if marauding lions kill their livestock. Lookouts recruited from local communities also warn villagers and herders if lions are in the area.

Importantly, experts say, by protecting wild lions and their habitats locals in Africa can ensure a better future for themselves. Lions, as well as other large animals like elephants and giraffes, can thrive only in ample and healthy natural environments. Thus, protecting those natural environments is very much in the interests of people who share them with lions."~[]

giants”~"Sensors suction-cupped onto whales’ backs are helping biologists answer two big questions. Why are whales so large? And why aren’t they bigger?

Being big can boost the ability of whales to reach more food and with less effort. That can help them access deep-sea prey that would be beyond the reach of many other creatures. In a new study, scientists estimated how much energy 13 species of whales and porpoises use — and gain — when foraging. They conclude that how big the creatures get depends on how and what they eat and how much food they can find.

Jeremy Goldbogen works at Stanford University in California. As a comparative physiologist (Phiz-ee-OL-oh-gist), he studies how the bodies of animals work. He specializes in whales. For the new study, he worked with a large team of researchers to learn how whale size relates to what whales eat and how they get it.

Toothed whales, such as orcas, echolocate (Ek-oh-LOW-kayt) to hunt for individual prey. The whales’ size appears to be limited by how much food they can grab during one dive, the researchers report. That’s not the case, though, for blue whales and other filter feeders. They open their mouths wide and bring in a large gulp of water — along with whatever is in it. Then they shove the water back out between big baleen plates. Afterward, they swallow the food caught behind those plates.

These animals tend to be much larger than their toothed cousins. Filter feeders alive today aren’t constrained by food availability. So they might be limited by other factors, such as how large a body they can physically support. These animals might even be on their way to evolving to become bigger still, the team suggests in the December 13 Science.

“This is a fascinating study,” says Samantha Price. She is a biologist at Clemson University in South Carolina who studies how animals’ bodies have evolved. She was not part of the new research. Biologists have been thinking about the evolution of bigness for a long time, Price says. These researchers, “through incredible effort, actually got some data about these hard-to-study behaviors,” she notes.

In the last 5 million years, whales have become larger than ever, Goldbogen says. The blue whale grew into the largest creature ever throughout the history of life. He says that could be due to changes in glacial cycles, winds — even ocean currents. Those changes have focused upwellings of nutrients in pockets of the sea. The nutrients attract dense patches of tiny crustaceans, fish and other animals. And that creates whale buffets.

Being large has helped whales exploit such food bonanzas in a few ways. Bigger creatures can travel farther using less energy per unit of mass. So big whales can cross wide swaths of barren ocean to reach food-rich upwellings. Larger bodies also support larger lungs. And more air means more time for feeding during dives.

Simply put, bigger whales were thought to be more efficient at finding food, Goldbogen says. But that was mostly just an educated guess, he adds. Researchers didn’t have good data about how much energy whales gained from food or used while diving and hunting. “We just didn’t know much about what these animals were actually doing underwater,” he explains.

Whale trackers

Goldbogen and an international team of researchers worked to change that. They employed technology-packed sensors. The researchers used suction cups to stick the sensors to the backs of whales. In all, the team attached sensors to 300 whales. These belonged to 13 species. They ranged from 50-kilogram (110-pound) harbor porpoises to 150,000-kilogram (330,000-pound) blue whales. Over a decade, the team tracked more than 10,000 feeding events. “It was no small task,” Goldbogen says.

The tags relayed data that became a daily diary of the whales’ activity. Pressure sensors and accelerometers tracked the whales’ movements and depth. Hydrophones recorded sounds. These included the clicks and buzzes used to hunt and socialize. And cameras captured video of the animals’ surroundings. All together, these data helped the researchers tell when filter-feeding giants opened their mouths to lunge at swarms of krill. They could show when sperm whales echolocated an octopus. And they allowed the researchers to gauge how much energy different species use on each dive.

The team also captured sonar readings of prey density. They even dissected the stomach contents of stranded whales. That info, plus data from the tags, painted a detailed picture of what different whales ate. Then the researchers calculated an energy budget for each species. That refers to how much energy an animal has to spend to get food and how much it gains from eating that food. Such budgets help show how foraging efficiency relates to body size.

Toothed whales usually hunt squid or octopus. Being big helps these whales dive deep to access more food, the researchers found. But after a point, their foraging efficiency falls with increased size. True, a giant squid offers a lot of fuel. But such prey are few and far between. What’s more, finding them takes a lot of energy. There just aren’t enough in the ocean for the whales to get any bigger, Goldbogen says.

In contrast, bulk filter feeders get more efficient with size. These eaters target dense swarms of tiny krill and other crustaceans. In a single gulp, the whales can get a huge number of calories. (Goldbogen says calculations suggest more than 10 million of them!) And it takes less effort than chasing down a squid. So blue whales and other filter feeders may not be limited by a lack of prey. Instead, their top body size may be due to other factors. Maybe it’s how far a whale heart can pump blood, or how large a jaw can grow. The study didn’t look at such factors or try to figure out what the physical limits on their growth might be. But it may not be possible physically to engulf more krill than big whales already do.

Or it’s possible the size of these ocean giants might not be limited at all. The creatures might still be evolving to get even bigger. That could be true as long as populations of krill stay abundant. Speculates Goldbogen, “Perhaps, millions of years from now, we’ll see even bigger ocean giants.”"~[]

Taking yet another step in this direction, starting 27 January, at 9 PM, the channel is all set to premiere an incredible 10-part series ‘The Lion Kingdom’ which will take viewers at the forefront of India’s battle with the deadly Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) which threatened to wipe out the last of the surviving Asiatic Lions in the world living in the wilds of the Gir National Park. Produced by film-maker Upma Bhatnagar, Executive Producer and Director, Optimum Television, The Lion Kingdom features renowned veterinary surgeon Steve Leonard as the series host.

This incredible series is the story of the Asiatic Lions’ fight with destiny and their triumph over a disease that had wiped out over 1000 lions in one deadly sweep in the Serengeti National Pak in Tanzania in the 1990s. These lions with their valiant fight for survival truly live up to their name - being referred to as India’s Pride. However, along with the indomitable spirits of glorious beasts, the relentless efforts of those working in the background – the forest department and the veterinarians is what truly helped turn this almost disaster into a story of hope.

The Lion Kingdom is a story of how the forest department of Gir National Park worked round the clock to try and save the king of the jungle while battling heavy rains and flooding and dealing with a sudden increase in the number of crocodiles in the area as a result! For the first time ever, not only will audiences get to witness the functioning of the veterinarian hospital in Gir, the only National park in India that has a full-fledged hospital for animals with the latest medical equipment, but they will also get to marvel at the transformation of Gir during the monsoons as this is the first time ever the National Park has been filmed during the rains.

“The deadly CDV virus had the potential to impact India’s pride – the Asiatic lions at The Gir National Park. The outstanding work done by our forest department to handle a crisis of this magnitude is a story which had to be shared with the world,” said, Discovery South Asia Content, Factual & Lifestyle Entertainment director Sai Abishek. “This series is a testimony to our purpose to grow awareness about wildlife conservation and instill a sense of pride and empathy among audiences towards these incredible animals and those working to save them.”

Optimum Television executive producer and director Upma Bhatnagar said, “It was the serious most alarm not only in Gir, but in India’s entire conservation history since independence. At stake was the existence of an entire species – Asiatic lions – that does not exist anywhere else in the world. When I heard many scientists and conservationists expressing fears that the Indian lion may not be able to come out of this crisis, I was really worried. Gir is very special to me. This is where I had filmed my first TV series, The Lion Queens of India. I enjoy a special bond with the land, its people and its majestic animals. We spoke with Discovery India who sensed the gravity of the situation and gave us their full creative and logistic support to share our story with the nation.”"~[]

PHOTO: XINHUA/ALAMY STOCK PHOTO

In November, 2019, 4-year-old panda Bei Bei, born on American soil to parents on loan from China, departed the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. (1). China's loan arrangements specify that all panda cubs born abroad are the property of China and must be sent back to China for scientific and reproduction purposes (2). The 10-year loan agreements, which cost the host country a rental fee of US$1 million, have been in place since the mid-1980s and currently cover about 50 pandas in captivity outside China (3). However, the current terms of the agreements are not in the best interests of the pandas or panda research.

When the loans were originally created in 1982, China's panda population, then at about 1100 individuals (4), was dwindling. At that time, it was important to augment the population with new panda cubs. However, the population has since grown, recently reaching 2300 individuals (5). Because the local panda gene pool is now large enough to enable breeding, it is no longer necessary to send all panda cubs back to China.

If returned panda cubs were released to their original wild habitat in China and scientifically monitored remotely, then their ecological value might justify uprooting them from their place of birth. However, upon their return to China, the cubs remain in captivity (6). Given the challenges that the repatriated cubs face, including difficult adjustments to a new climate, feeding regimen, and breeding culture (7–9), returning them to China may not be to their benefit.

The current loan arrangements should be updated to ensure that they are furthering the goals of species protection, scientific research, and cultural exchanges. The length of the loan period should be more flexible, with extensions available. Cubs should be returned to China only if it is in their best interest. Overseas hosts should have the opportunity to conduct observation and breeding projects for cubs born on their soil. This would require effective cooperation between Chinese panda researchers and their overseas counterparts at the host zoos. The financial revenue collected through the loans—which sometimes seems to serve as a commercial benefit for Chinese zoo and attractions developers (10) rather than a self-sustaining investment in species conservation—should be better monitored and allocated instead to support and research programs for the returned pandas. Finally, China's wildlife authorities should develop a more supportive regulatory framework of panda protection and research at a global scale, as well as promote international cooperation and long-term eco-cultural exchanges through the loan arrangements.

The 737 MAX remains grounded, some workers have shuffled off to other job sites and headlines about engineering problems linger after crashes killed hundreds.

But with production of the troubled jet on hold, the company hopes for one last flight — from the creatures who invented the concept.

For about four years, a pair of peregrine falcons has been nesting inside the massive factory where the 737 MAX is assembled, making their home on metal girders several stories above workers. The raptors feed on pigeons and starlings unfortunate enough to flutter through hangar doors.

Wild peregrine falcons rarely live indoors and have not been documented to breed inside, said Bud Anderson, a local raptor expert who has studied the birds for decades.

“I’m not aware of this happening ever before,” he said.

Three of the pair’s offspring have fallen from the nest and walked the factory floors.

Now, it’s time for the adult pair to go.

When it comes to the birds, the plant’s shutdown represents both burden and opportunity for the hobbling aerospace giant. In a turbulent stretch of Boeing’s history, the birds offer a rare reprieve from bludgeoning headlines.

“It’s quite an interesting story,” said CJ Nothum, a Boeing spokeswoman.

The plant’s closure — which will keep the hangar doors shuttered more often than usual — could represent the best opportunity to flush the birds out to a better home.

But evictions are rarely simple, even when they might be in a creatures’ best interest. And peregrine falcons, who can fly half as fast as a commercial jet, are no ordinary creature.

“Little indoor ecosystem”

Last June, a young peregrine falcon leaped from the rafters above the assembly line. State wildlife officials call them “early jumpers,” more brave and less coordinated than flying requires.

It’s a common problem for young, urban peregrines.

“They can’t fly for beans,” said Ed Deal, who bands and tracks the birds in Seattle and is the president of the Urban Raptor Conservancy.

The fledgling fractured his sternum and was taken to PAWS Wildlife Center, a rehabilitation facility in Lynnwood, according to a PAWS spokeswoman.

Three days later, a second young falcon, a female, arrived at PAWS. A third bird showed up a week later.

Boeing hosted a nest, the staff realized, and it had become a problem.

In fact, adult peregrine falcons have been nesting in the assembly plant for four years, according to Nothum, the Boeing spokeswoman. The company had to hire a vendor to “clean up all those droppings and sanitize the factory areas so they wouldn’t pose any health concerns.”

Two of the injured fledglings had been found “walking around on the assembly-line floor in between planes,” said Deal, who last fall visited twice with Boeing, trying to help the company solve the peregrine predicament.

The third was discovered in a break area for workers, according to Deal.

The factory had become “this little indoor ecosystem,” Deal said. “I saw a peregrine chasing a crow in the rafters.”

The birds, he believes, also learned to listen for a bell that signals the opening of the hangar doors. Then, they’d jet out of the building to hunt in fresh air.

Urban hunters

Peregrine falcons propel themselves faster than any other animal. The fearsome hunters’ spectacular dives for prey, called stoops, have been clocked as high as 242 mph.

In the wild, peregrine falcons are often found on the edge of cliffs.

“They like high spots, protected, so predators can’t get up to them,” Deal said.

The birds become attached to nest sites. In the Northwest, birds typically don’t migrate, but do sometimes wander, only to return to familiar areas to breed in spring and nest, often with the same partners. Some never leave nest sites.

The peregrine falcons’ history is a tale of comeback.

Decades ago, use of the toxic insecticide DDT sent the species spiraling toward extinction in North America and Europe.

Advertising

“DDT wiped out peregrines in the late ’40s and early ’50s,” Anderson said.

In 1975, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated only 324 nesting pairs could be found in North America.

A ban on DDT and captive breeding programs willed the creatures off the endangered-species list in 1999. The birds have continued to spread. Now, Washington state hosts at least 125 peregrine falcon nesting pairs, Deal said.

Peregrines came to Seattle in the 1990s, Anderson said.

They’ve taken to Seattle’s million-dollar views — the ledges of skyscrapers or bridges that offer protection and nest space.

Beginning in 1994, nesting pairs of peregrines famously raised offspring atop a perch at the 1201 Third Avenue building in downtown Seattle, formerly called Washington Mutual Tower. Anderson installed a nest box for the birds there. The building manager, Wright Runstad, and volunteers installed a “Falcon Cam” for public viewing.

When wild animals are injured, rehabilitation centers typically patch them up and return them home.

Advertising

For the three fledglings, that was not an option.

“You can’t release the birds back into the hangar,” Anderson said.

In the end, the three birds were taken to falconers, who train and hunt with raptors. Without this training, the birds would be unlikely to survive.

The males went to Mount Vernon and Addy, Stevens County. Allen Gardner, a falconer in Spokane, took possession of the female fledgling.

“Her name is Lena,” Gardner said. “But her nickname is Bo, for Boeing.”

Gardner said Lena arrived with six broken primary feathers, which would have made it impossible for her to fly.

Gardner took feathers that had previously molted from another falcon and cut them to size. Then, a veterinarian put Lena under so Gardner could insert a tiny sliver of bamboo to join the shafts of both feathers. Now that she can fly, Gardner has been training Lena to hunt, which could take up to a year.

“She happens to be a very easy to handle — a very amenable bird. She’ll cluck at me and kind of talk,” Gardner said.

He describes his birds as athletes and said he gets a thrill from being around them.

“It’s hard to describe the experience of a peregrine falcon flying at 250 mph by your head,” Gardner said. “I get a rush.”

A tricky relocation

The adult falcons’ future remains unclear.

With the 737 MAX out of production, Nothum said Boeing won’t be opening the assembly doors as frequently.

The falcons risk going hungry, Deal said.

“It depends on how many other birds are in the hangar. Otherwise, they’ll starve,” he said.

Boeing, wildlife officials and falcon experts all agree that it’s time for the pair to go.

Advertising

The company contacted the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Services program about removing the birds. The federal agency often resolves wildlife conflicts and sometimes kills animals, which raised concern for some. The agency in 2018 killed nearly 1.5 million native animals, including two peregrine falcons, according to its own data.

When reached by phone, Brook Zscheile, a wildlife biologist for the agency, said USDA had been brought in to “trap and relocate” the birds, and would explain in more detail after speaking with the agency’s legal counsel. Zscheile did not return several follow-up calls and emails seeking more information.

It’s unclear whether Zscheile and USDA plan to release the peregrines nearby, or transport them across the state for release.

Instead of trapping, Deal favors installing nest boxes on the assembly plant’s roof, before harassing the birds out of the hangar, closing the doors for several months and hoping the peregrines take to the man-made nests.

“The real solution is closing the doors at the right time,” Anderson said, adding that if the doors remain closed through March, the falcons will go through courtship and settle down elsewhere.

When it comes to the birds, “the shutdown is almost a blessing in disguise,” Deal said. “The urge to nest is strong.”

Advertising

Deal is concerned trapping and relocating the birds far from Renton could cause them harm.

Peregrine falcons are notoriously difficult to trap, he said.

No matter how far they’re moved, experts say the birds will likely fly back to their nest.

Jeff Kidd, a California raptor biologist, said he relocated six peregrine falcons from San Diego to Northern California during the years 2013 to 2016. Four returned, navigating some 660 miles back to their nests. The other two died, Kidd said.

And getting permits to move the birds out of state “would be a nightmare,” Anderson said.

The Siberian tiger gave birth to five healthy cubs following a fourth-month pregnancy. This is the second time that Magda has given birth at the zoo in two years. But three of the cubs are actually white Siberian tigers, a very rare and endangered breed.

Photos uploaded online by the park show a protective Magda breastfeeding her newborn cubs. When speaking TVM, owner Anton Cutajar expressed his content with the cubs, noting that four are of a rare colour; three white and one golden.

“Three white Siberian cubs were born this night,” Anton announced on Facebook yesterday. “God is great!”

The addition of the new cubs brings the total number of tigers at the sanctuary to 23.

The park is also home to an extremely rare and endangered White Siberian tiger, Blanca, with estimates of the remaining population at less than 20 in the world.

However, it does seem that thanks to days like this, the white Siberian tiger population might be slowly on the rise after all.

It is believed that there are only some 500 Siberian tigers left in the world, with the number of white specimen being way less than half of that number."~[]

SAN DIEGO (KUSI) – The Southern White Rhino born November, 2019 at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park can now be seen by anyone visiting the park.

“Future” is San Diego Zoo Global’s 100th southern white rhino born at the Safari Park, and she is only the second calf in North America to be born following hormone-induced ovulation and artificial insemination. Her name celebrates these monumental milestones—and the hope she brings to the future of rhino conservation worldwide.

Future’s birth by artificial insemination represents a critical step in the organization’s ongoing work to develop the scientific knowledge required to genetically recover the northern white rhino, a distant subspecies of the southern white rhino. Only two northern white rhinos currently remain on Earth and, unfortunately, both are female.

On any given day, visitors to the Safari Park may be able to see one or more of the southern white rhinos living at the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center—including Future and Amani—from the Africa Tram. Future will eventually be introduced to the other rhinos living at the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center, including her potential playmate, 4-month-old Edward—the first calf born at the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center, and the first in North America conceived through artificial insemination.

KUSI’s Allie Wagner spent the morning in Escondido hanging out with the new calf, Future."~[]

SAN DIEGO, Calif. - A 10-week-old southern white rhino calf at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park made a new friend when she met a six-month old southern white rhino calf on Saturday.

It was the first time the 10-week-old calf, Future, met two rhinos other than her mother, Amani.

Six-month-old Edward was grazing with his mother Victoria when Future and Amani were given access to the front outdoor area at the zoo's rhino rescue center.

The young rhinos were hesitant to approach each other at first, according to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park staff, but eventually their curiosity kicked in and the two came nose to nose.

After that, Future and Edward instantly bonded, playing and running around the habitat."~[]

David Wheeler, executive director of Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey, said there were 78 young falcons in 2019 compared to 75 the previous year.

""Remarkable when you factor in that there were no peregrine falcons east of the Mississippi river just a few decades ago,"" he noted.

Since the early 1980s, peregrine falcons have been recovering at a slow but steady pace in New Jersey.

The birds are facile at finding suitable nests amid New Jersey's dense human population.

""They've adapted to be able to nest very successfully on bridges and skyscrapers and other high vantage points that are man-made,"" Wheeler said.

Wheeler says the elimination of the pesticide DDT from the food chain was a big help in bringing back the population.

""And at the same time, the work of our biologists and scientists from the state and all the volunteers that support their work have managed to continue strengthening the nesting spots chosen by falcons by putting in nest boxes that help protect them a from the elements,"" he added.

The peregrine is the fastest creature on earth, reaching speeds of 200 mph diving for prey such as pigeons and small birds.

""It's pretty incredible that we have the fastest animal on earth right here in New Jersey, and not just in New Jersey, but flying above many of our our major cities in Newark and Elizabeth, in Jersey City to Trenton and Atlantic City,"" Wheeler said.

specialist group~"Cyril Christo recently sounded a passionate call for lion conservation amidst the decline of this iconic species. We share Christo’s enchantment with the lion and the African wilderness. We, too, want future generations to live in a world with lions and other wildlife and share the belief that the conservation of wildlife should benefit the people living alongside them. However, we believe the role of trophy hunting is not nearly as negative as Christo fears.

As in the United States, hunting has long played a major role in funding and protecting wild places and wildlife in Africa, including threatened species such as lions. While lions have disappeared from more than 90 percent of their historic range, the global conservation authority IUCN confirms that trophy hunting is not a major threat to the big cats. Rather, lions are primarily threatened by habitat loss, livestock encroachment, loss of wild prey, and conflict with people wanting to protect their lives and livelihoods.

Trophy hunting can play a major role in mitigating these key threats. Financial and other benefits from trophy hunting incentivize land-owners to maintain habitat and wildlife populations. Mapping in late 2019 revealed that more of the lion’s range was protected under hunting areas than in National Parks.

Trophy hunting is not a panacea, however, particularly in areas with poor governance. Poorly managed trophy hunting can threaten local lion populations. Equally, well-managed trophy hunting can benefit lion populations, as seen on conservancies in Zimbabwe and Namibia, the only two African countries with increasing wild lion populations.

The potential benefits of trophy hunting are well demonstrated in Coutada 11, a hunting area in Mozambique where after decades of absence, the roar of the lion is once again being heard. More than two decades of limited trophy hunting has allowed hunting operator Mark Haldane to fund habitat conservation and anti-poaching efforts that have nursed Coutada 11 back to health after Mozambique’s protracted war. The number of sable antelope has increased by more than 6,000 percent and the African buffalo grew 16 fold to more than 20,000 animals. Haldane has now reintroduced two prides of lions to the area, not for lion hunting, but to help keep growing game populations in check. In the process, they expanded the range of the African lion by 2.5 million acres, an achievement on par with the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park.

The success in Coutada 11 is just one example of what will be lost should trophy hunting be banished as a conservation option, as some are demanding and which legislation like the CECIL Act would facilitate. Indeed, a peer-reviewed study emanating from the University of Pretoria found that should trophy hunting cease, wildlife conservation would no longer be an economically competitive land use on more than 14 million acres of wildlands in Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia. Restrictions imposed by the U.S. on the importation of lion trophies from Tanzania are already bearing this prediction out as hunting blocks are abandoned and habitat loss increases.

Authors like Christo call for alternatives, and we would welcome them. However, the simple fact is that economically viable alternatives do not currently exist for most African hunting blocks which often have naturally low densities of wildlife, and are too remote, dangerous, and unattractive for photo-tourism. Should hunting be abandoned without better alternatives in place, the likelihood is that land will be converted to agriculture, prey populations will decline and conflicts with people will increase. Illegal lion killings, particularly from human-lion conflict, are estimated to be around 5-10 times higher, and in some areas 50-100 times higher, than the level that would be permitted under trophy hunting. The widespread use of snares and poison means these killings are indiscriminate, removing cubs, females and young males with devastating impacts on lion populations. Those deaths won’t be on social media, but will have very real consequences for lion conservation and welfare.

Opposition to trophy hunting is based on concern for wildlife conservation and is often well-intentioned. However we should take the time to separate facts from propaganda and listen to scientists and stakeholders to avoid prioritizing emotions over evidence. If we do not, we could inadvertently worsen the situation for both wildlife and rural communities and create the very conservation catastrophe that we are all desperate to avoid.

birdoriginally published live science~"When Lendrum was apprehended in June 2018, he was carrying rare falcon eggs strapped to his body in a custom sling.

Two grinning men pose for a video camera in front of a helicopter: ""We're going on a tour,"" one of them says and laughs. But what they were about to do was no joyride; it was both dangerous and illegal. They were attempting to steal the eggs of rare falcons from the birds' nests, on a perilously steep cliff in Nunavik territory in northern Quebec.

Another clip shows one of the men, Jeffrey Lendrum, dangling from a harness, a pouch at the ready for holding stolen eggs. Recorded in 2000, the footage was found in Lendrum's luggage when he was arrested in May 2010 in the United Kingdom on suspicion of smuggling 14 peregrine falcon eggs out of the country, the BBC reported that year .

Lendrum pled guilty to that crime in August 2010, but the conviction wasn't his first — nor would it be his last. Over four decades, Lendrum steadily built a reputation as a master smuggler of endangered falcon eggs, stealing them from locations around the world and selling them to private collectors for tens of thousands of dollars apiece. His remarkable tale comes together piece by astonishing piece in the book ""The Falcon Thief: A True Tale of Adventure, Treachery and the Hunt for the Perfect Bird"" (Simon & Schuster) by Joshua Hammer, published today (Feb. 11).

Falcons are swift and graceful birds of prey, and people have trained and bred these raptors as hunters for thousands of years across the Middle East, where falcons are still highly valued, Hammer told Live Science.

Breeding captive falcons for collectors is a tightly regulated and extremely profitable business. Healthy adult peregrines (Falco peregrinus) may fetch as much as $25,000 from eager collectors in Qatar, while the Arctic gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), the largest of all falcons, can command a price of up to $250,000, Forbes reported in 2015 .

""Some Arab sheiks are willing to pay $400,000 for a single white gyrfalcon, which is considered the most beautiful and rarest of birds,"" Hammer said.

In fact, demand across the Persian Gulf for wild falcons is so high that opportunities abound for people like Lendrum, who steal and sell the protected birds and their eggs. Research into Lendrum's underworld network revealed just a glimpse of an extensive black market for illegal falcons, Hammer added.

""Lendrum's not the only one who would go off to remote corners of Russia or Pakistan or any place you find wild raptors, and catch these birds and then smuggle them,"" he said.

When writing ""The Falcon Thief,"" Hammer tracked down the camera operator who shot the Quebec helicopter footage, an associate of Lendrum's named Paul Mullin. That story became one of the centerpieces of Hammer's book, and the ""outlandish, expensive operation, apparently financed by the sheiks,"" marked the pinnacle of Lendrum's criminal career, according to Hammer.

""It was kind of all downhill from there,"" he said.

""The Falcon Thief,"" by Joshua Hammer ""Joshua Hammer has that rare eye for a thrilling story, and with The Falcon Thief he has found the perfect one— a tale brimming with eccentric characters, obsession, deception, and beauty. It has the grip of a novel, with the benefit of being all true."" — David Grann, NY Times bestselling author View Deal

Multiple arrests

Though Lendrum is but a single player in the illegal falcon trade, he's arguably the best-known of these egg thieves, due to the spectacle of his airport arrests over the past 10 years. His capture in May 2010 at Birmingham Airport airport in the U.K. made headlines, and was accompanied by a photo of Lendrum wearing 14 swaddled peregrine eggs taped to his body in a custom sling to keep them warm, according to the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).

But Lendrum insisted that they were duck eggs, and that he was wearing them on his doctor's recommendation to help with back pain, Hammer wrote in the book. That excuse didn't fly with the judge, who sentenced Lendrum to 30 months in jail, the RSPB reported.

Lendrum was arrested again in October 2015 at Sao Paulo International Airport in Brazil, as he was trying to board a plane with an incubator holding four eggs he had stolen in Chile; those eggs were thought to belong to the rare peregrine subspecies Falco peregrinus cassini, or Cassini falcon, the UK National Wildlife Crime Unit (NWCU) reported . Chicks from these eggs would have commanded up to $80,000 each on the black market, according to the NWCU.

In January 2016, a Brazilian judge sentenced Lendrum to 4.5 years in jail, but Lendrum had already skipped bail and left the country (he is currently facing extradition to Brazil, The Guardian reported ).

However, Brazilian officials will have to wait for Lendrum to first finish serving yet another sentence in the U.K. He was arrested in June 2018 arriving at Heathrow Airport from Johannesburg, South Africa, and he was carrying a substantial payload of purloined avian wildlife, a U.K. Border Control representative said in a statement .

""During a full search, he was found to be wearing a body belt concealing 19 bird eggs as well as 2 newly-hatched chicks,"" according to the statement.

At the trial, Lendrum told the court that ""his intention was to rescue the eggs after he encountered some men chopping down trees containing their nests."" But wildlife experts overturned his story when they identified the eggs as originating from nests on cliffs, and on Jan. 10, Lendrum was sentenced to 3 years and 1 month in prison.

""He can't stop lying""

For some people, serving a string of jail terms in multiple countries might be a deterrent to future crimes, perhaps encouraging them to rethink their thieving ways. However, that was clearly not the case with Lendrum, who to this day downplays the seriousness of his acts and continues to spin fabulous fabrications about his intentions for the eggs that he has stolen, Hammer said.

""He can't stop lying,"" Hammer said. ""I saw the interrogation tapes when he was on trial in Brazil; he'll tell these incredibly outlandish lies one after another, which the judge basically laughed at before sentencing him to five years in prison.""

Lendrum's convoluted and fantastic explanations for his so-called conservation activities, along with his utter lack of remorse, likely also contributed to the length of his latest prison sentence in the U.K., Hammer added.

""He was very opaque — sort of a self-deluding liar — and he remained in total denial about everything that he had done, even though the evidence was just so overwhelming,"" Hammer said.

As Lendrum himself said in an interview with Hammer: ""I honestly didn't think that there would be a problem if I were caught.""

Edinburgh Zoo's pride of lions have been spotted getting into the Valentine's Day spirit.

Staff from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland decided to treat their endangered Asian lions Roberta and Jayendra to decorated boxes full of treats.

Roberta and Jayendra were joined last summer by newborns, Mitaali, Keshari and Kushanu.

Now, the Zoo have shared photos of the proud parents celebrating the romantic day with their six-month old cubs.

The three cubs were born at Edinburgh Zoo in August 2019 and named in tribute to the Gir forest in western India where the endangered species is found.

The family are all are part of the European endangered species programme for the Asiatic lion, a species estimated to only have between 350 and 650 individuals left in the wild.

The Asian lion differs from the African lion in several ways. Asian lions are generally smaller than their African cousins, and the males do not develop such a substantial mane, so their ears are more visible.

Looks like a fun day for the adorable cubs."~[]

Hose2Habitat, headquartered in Maryland, is a nonprofit organization that upcycles donated discarded materials to build items designed to improve the well-being of wild animals in human care. (The name comes from the old firehoses that two volunteer first responders donated to start the project.)

The photo by Uriel Nouri, a keeper in the Biblical Zoo’s carnivore section, shows two of the zoo’s three red pandas – named Ying, Yang and Tika – playing on the structure built for them by the carnivore keepers led by Binyamin Feinsod.

The team worked with Hila Bar, a Hebrew University of Jerusalem student who also works at the zoo, together with at-risk youth from the Makers organization.

Makers teaches at-risk youth about technology, sustainability and the environment through activities, rather than passive learning.

Bar, the staff and the youngsters planned and constructed a safe yet challenging climbing wall to help the red pandas stay physically and mentally fit.

The keepers place tasty treats on the wall’s bumps to give the pandas incentive to climb, a natural behavior of red pandas."~[]

Researchers Orla O'Brien and Amy Warren from the New England Aquarium surveyed the vast Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument to document the region's biodiversity and count the number of animals living and feeding in the area.

According to the aquarium, the two researchers spotted the first of the two blue whales after seeing a group of 50 bottlenose dolphins.

The first blue whale was spotted over the monument's Oceanographer Canyon, the deepest of the national park.

The aquarium defined the discovery as ""important"" because while blue whales are known to frequent these particular areas, the Northwest Atlantic only counts around 250 animals.

O'Brien and Warren also counted 322 whales and dolphins, as well as pilot, fin, sei, humpback, sperm and Sowerby's beaked whales in what has been the first aerial survey to be conducted in winter months."~[]

The incredibly rare Amur Tiger was trying to cross a main road near Gogolevka village in the Primorsky Krai, a federal subject in the Far East region of Russia on the border of both China and North Korea. The bus driver reportedly had no way of avoiding the tiger cub.

A video caught the moment the endangered cub was hit. After it was hit, the cub got back up but was dazed and confused. The baby tiger then stumbled back into the woods. The driver reported the accident and a hunting patrol later found the tiger’s remains.

The animal is thought to have died from its injuries and was found to be aged just four or five months old. Sergey Aramilev, head of the Amur Tiger Centre dedicated to saving the threatened species, commented: “This is a truly tragic death of a tiger cub, and in this story there are a number of questions that are not yet answered. “The main one is why the tiger cub was alone on the road, without its mother, which at this age should always be there. “Experts of hunting supervision are now trying to get an answer to this and other questions.” READ MORE: Lethal two-headed cobra discovered which could kill 20 people

“It is truly a tragic set of circumstances: an accident occurred in the dark, this section of the road is not lit, and the cub jumped out in front of the bus at the most inopportune moment. “The driver did not have any chance to avoid the collision…the driver acted correctly, he avoided injuring passengers and almost saved the animal.” But experts are determined to find out the fate of the cub’s mother. “It is very important to understand what happened to the tigress,” he added. “In the best case, she is healthy and alive, and in the worst, some disaster happened to her, and the tiger cub, left alone, went on his last trip.

Red pandas, the bushy-tailed and russet-furred bamboo munchers of Asia's high forests, are not a single species but rather two distinct ones, according to the most comprehensive genetic study to date on these endangered mammals. Scientists said on Wednesday they found substantial divergences between the two species - Chinese red pandas and Himalayan red pandas - in three genetic markers in an analysis of DNA from 65 of the animals. The recognition of the existence of two separate species could help guide conservation efforts for a mammal adored by many people even as its numbers dwindle in the wild, they added. Chinese red pandas are found in northern Myanmar as well as southeastern Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China, while Himalayan red pandas are native to Nepal, India, Bhutan and southern Tibet in China, the researchers said. International experts have estimated a total population of roughly 10,000 red pandas in the wild. ""To conserve the genetic uniqueness of the two species, we should avoid their interbreeding in captivity,"" said Chinese Academy of Sciences conservation biologist Yibo Hu, who along with colleague Fuwen Wei led the study published in the journal Science Advances. ""Interbreeding between species may harm the genetic adaptations already established for their local habitat environment."" Scientists previously recognised red pandas as divided into two subspecies. While it had been proposed that these were separate species, the new study was the first to provide the genetic data necessary to allow such a judgment. The Himalayan red panda is the scarcer of the two and needs urgent protection because of low genetic diversity and small population size, Wu said. The Yalu Zangbu River most likely marks the geographical boundary separating the two species, not the Nujiang River as previously believed, Wu added. The two species also differ in colouration and skull shape. ""The Himalayan red panda has more white on the face, while the face coat colour of the Chinese red panda is redder with less white on it. The tail rings of the Chinese red panda are more distinct than those of the Himalayan red panda, with the dark rings being more dark red and the pale rings being more whitish,"" Hu said. Slightly bigger than a domestic cat, red pandas have thick fur, a short snout and pointed ears, spending much of their life in trees and dining mostly on bamboo. Major threats to red pandas include deforestation and degradation of their habitat due to human development. Despite similar names, red pandas and giant pandas are not closely related. Giant pandas are one of the world's eight bear species. Red pandas, with no close living relatives, are sometimes called living fossils as the only remaining member of the Ailuridae mammalian family.

I was spending the day at an amusement park with some local friends while visiting Hong Kong. I found out the place, Ocean Park, doubled as a zoo — because who doesn’t want to ride a roller coaster in between checking out king penguins and koala bears? Ocean Park is tucked in the hills overlooking the ocean, and you have to take a cable car over the mountain to get to the other side of the park.

The red panda made its appearance as I was leaving the park. He was surrounded by a miniature bamboo grove. I took a moment to admire the small, fuzzy red-haired creature, sleeping in a tree despite a dozen or so tourists looking and talking at him in loud awe. He looked nothing like the giant panda in the next pen over, but he sure was cute.

Since I barely made it through the day without sweating in the summer humidity, I wondered how the thick-furred red panda functioned in the humidity and high summer temperatures.

As it turns out, the ring-tailed mammal is native to Southwestern China and the Himalayas and is fairly adaptable to many climates. It’s also endangered.

If you’ve ever wanted to see a red panda in person, you don’t have to go to Hong Kong (though Ocean Park is a much better experience and local favorite than, say, Disneyland Hong Kong). Instead, I recommend you go on an adventure through a local ecotourism and conservation organization based in Eugene.

The trip? Hiking in the lush forests of the Himalayan foothills and spotting red pandas in their natural habitat.

Working out of Eugene and Kathmandu, Nepal, the Red Panda Network (RPN) has organized trips for red panda fans while supporting conservation efforts since 2007.

I’ve never been on one of these trips, but the experience of seeing (in my opinion) one of the cutest creatures in the wild is a step up from a Chinese theme park-zoo.

There are a few different versions of the panda-spotting trip: one for ecologists and staff of RPN’s zoo partners, a photography-centered trip and a standard hike to see red pandas.

Any adventure chosen is a choice to partner with Red Panda Network’s efforts in conservation, says Terrance Fleming, RPN’s development manager. It achieves this by partnering with the local villages and communities in Nepal. He says RPN has a strong relationship with the people in villages they frequent. Travelers stay in the homes of the locals and pay to use other local services: meals, transportation, porters, etc.

RPN also supports the endangered red panda by teaching farmers sustainable practices and managing forest clearcutting.

“We’ve found that eco-tourism is one of the most effective ways to conserve species, specifically for red pandas,” Fleming says.

If you decide to take a trip, it will take you hours to fly to Kathmandu, and another five to eight hours driving in a jeep up to a village in the mountains. Once settled into the village, forest guardians — local stewards and conservation ambassadors from the local forests hired by RPN — will take the group up into the foothills of the Himalayas, surrounded by some of the biggest and tallest peaks in the world, including the ethereal Mount Everest.

It may take a few days to spot a red panda in the wild, but there is plenty of other wildlife to observe. On his trip, Fleming says, he saw a whole family of yellow-throated martens who are, unfortunately, predators of red pandas, despite being smaller. There are also forests bursting with rhododendron bushes.

The first time a group spots a red panda is an emotional experience, Fleming says. The groups often spend several days hiking through the diverse ecological wonderland of the Himalayas before they catch a glimpse of the elusive pandas.

“When you finally get to a place when you are looking up at one, people tear up. They get really emotional,” Fleming says. “It’s a very spiritual experience.”

The red panda’s thick fur acts as camouflage in the tree moss. They don’t want to be seen and if disturbed, their defense is to run and hide. When spotted, Fleming says, they are always looking down on you from their position curled around a tree branch.

During the different hikes, Fleming says they follow strict eco-tourism protocol. Groups don’t go back to the same site often, and they make sure to stay a safe distance away to not disturb the pandas.

“The fact that you get to go see a species that is so mysterious and rare without disturbing their environment and supporting local communities that their future depends on is pretty special,” Fleming says. He adds that every year, groups have seen more and more red pandas, due in part to conservation efforts, and that the forest guardians and RPN trip leaders are getting better at finding them.

The southern white rhino and northern white rhino are subspecies of the white rhino. Aside from living in different parts of Africa, they differ slightly in the shape of their teeth and heads, appearance of skin folds, and amount of hair. In general, southern whites are a little larger and hairier. Contrary to the species name, both subspecies are gray in color. ""White"" may be taken from the Afrikaans word for “wide,” in reference to their mouths, which are wide and square to help them graze on grass.



Habitat and behavior

Nearly 99 percent of southern white rhinos live in the savannas of Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, though the vast majority are found in South Africa. They can live up to 35 years in the wild and 40 in captivity.

White rhinos are semi-social and territorial. They stay together in herds on the grassy plains and mark their territory with strategically placed deposits of dung. The males defend their territory vigorously with their horns and massive sizes. Males tend to be more solitary than females, and live on about one square mile of land, whereas females can range over an area almost seven times as large.

White rhinos love mud. They will roll around in it, cover themselves with it, and cover their young with it. The wet mud cools them and protects their skin from sun and insects.

Threats to survival

Southern white rhinos were thought to be extinct in the late 19th century, until 1895, when a small population of fewer than a hundred were found in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. After a century of conservation efforts, there are 19,600-21,000 southern white rhinos in protected areas and private game reserves, especially in South Africa. They are now classified as near threatened. Their comeback is regarded as a major conservation success story.

Their cousins, the northern white rhinos, however, are nearly extinct. The last male northern white rhino, whose name was Sudan, died in 2018. The only two left in the world are females, a mother-daughter pair at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.

Poaching for their horns is one of the biggest threats to white rhinos. Their horns are in demand in Asia, primarily in Vietnam and China, for use in traditional medicines and for artistic carvings. Wealthy businessmen in particular desire rhino horn products as a way to show off that they have enough money and social status to buy something so rare and taboo.

Human development and habitat loss are also considered threats to the southern white rhino.

Conservation

The international trade in rhino horn has been banned by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a global treaty, since 1977, and the domestic trade within countries is mostly outlawed by national governments as well.

There is a heated debate among scientists, economists, government officials, and others over whether legalizing the international trade again would help decrease poaching. Efforts to do so, however, have so far failed. Nonetheless, South Africa ruled in 2017 to once again allow buying and selling of horn within the country. There is little demand for rhino horn within South Africa, however, leading many to worry the legal domestic trade will simply make the illegal international trade easier.

Many southern white rhinos in South Africa are under private ownership on rhino farms, where they’re used commercially for breeding, photographic tourism, legal hunting, and horn production. Breeding on rhino farms is one of reasons southern white rhino numbers have rebounded. Rhino owners are also on the front-lines of poaching, spending big sums each year on private security to protect their herds. Owners argue that a legal rhino horn trade would provide them with the income necessary to continue to fight poachers.

There are a number of creative ways people have used to try to protect rhinos from poachers, including injecting the rhinos' horns with poison (which wouldn’t harm the rhino but could dissuade buyers) and injecting horns with dye, though that doesn't seem to have helped. Some rhinos are dehorned to deter poachers—horn is like fingernails, which can be cut back without pain. The development of synthetic rhino horn is highly controversial, with many economists arguing that ending the illegal trade is not as simple as flooding the market to decrease the value of horn and the incentive to poach."~[]

Also commonly known as the ""Blue Whale"" by its friends in the deep blue sea, researchers recently concluded that the largest animals on Earth (land or ocean) are closer to the Connecticut Coast than they thought, according to the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life.

After seeing a group of 50 bottlenose dolphins, The NEAq (New England Aquarium) Aerial Survey Team researchers Amy Warren and Orla O'Brien spotted two blue whales on a February 9th trip to the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, just 130 miles southeast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The first blue whale was seen directly over the Oceanographer Canyon, which is the national park's deepest canyon being measured at over 4,000 feet deep.

According to the Anderson Cabot Center, blue whales are a rare sight to see in the Atlantic Ocean as only a few hundred remain. Despite being commonly spotted near deep canyons, the endangered species is projected to have only 250 animals left in the Northwest Atlantic ocean.

Understandably, to see one, let alone two of these precious whales grace the monument right off the Connecticut Coast was an exciting find for the two scientists. Not only was the sighting rare in itself, but one of the two blue whales also had a special sighting history dating back to the year 2000.

After the six-hour aerial survey of the underwater national park was over, the team found a total of 322 whales and dolphins. The Anderson Cabot Center reports that 17 of those whales belonged to different species, but only one was the true highlight of their inaugural winter trip to the Northeast Canyons: the blue whale.

With this exciting discovery comes an even stronger, anxious, extremely unrealistic hope for us to witness, on one hot summer day in the middle of August, an organismal behemoth of a sea elephant gracefully flop its body out then back into the water on the near horizon of one of our local Connecticut beaches. They're getting closer, so get your popcorn and sunscreen ready this summer: the blue whale, coming to a beach near you."~[]

What’s black and white and not all over? The answer, unfortunately, is the giant panda. While conservation efforts are underway, these cuddly creatures are facing serious problems in the wild. In honor of National Panda Day on March 16th, let’s take a look at the threats to these gentle giants, as well as learn some fascinating facts about them. Bonus: Adorable pics ahead!

The panda’s plight

Mainly because of habitat loss, there aren’t many giant pandas left in the world. That’s a common problem with many wild animal species you probably never realized were endangered. Other reasons the panda population is threatened: Illegal poaching for the black market remains a problem, pandas often have difficult pregnancies, and mother pandas only have enough milk to feed one cub, even though two or three cubs are often born at once. Plus, pandas are really picky in choosing a mate.

So, how dire is the situation? The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) says there are just 1,864 pandas left in the wild. There are an additional 400 pandas in captivity, according to Pandas International. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the giant panda as “vulnerable,” which is the category between “near threatened” and “endangered.” However, there is some good news: The population has started to increase slightly, thanks to breeding programs in China.

Their home turf

All existing pandas come from the bamboo forests of central China, so it’s appropriate to greet them with nǐ hǎo (pronounced “nee haow”), which is how you say “hello” in Mandarin. Pandas also used to live in Laos, Myanmar/Burma, and Vietnam, according to Sciencing.com.

Giant pandas have their own language

Hung_Chung_Chih/Getty ImagesPandas won’t say “hello” back, of course, but scientists say they have more varied vocalizations than any other type of bear. The San Diego Zoo reports that pandas growl, huff, squeak, bark, honk, coo, tweet, and even bleat like lambs.

Pandas International describes a linguistics project by the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. Researchers have figured out the meaning behind 13 different panda noises. They say that a mother panda will bark when a stranger approaches her cub and that male pandas baa like sheep when they’re in love. Supposedly, when a baby panda makes a “gee-gee” sound, it means “I’m hungry,” and “wow-wow” means the panda isn’t happy.

The perfect panda picnic

Giant pandas look a lot like teddy bears, especially when they sit down and stretch out their hind legs, a posture National Geographic says they like to use when eating. Speaking of which, a panda’s favorite meal is bamboo. In fact, these gentle giants rarely eat anything else and spend half of every day eating the fibrous stuff. However, bamboo isn’t the most nutritious of foods, especially for big animals like pandas. Bamboo is very low in protein, and the IUCN says pandas can digest less than 30 percent of it. A giant panda needs to eat between 25 and 40 pounds of bamboo daily, as well as have a sedentary lifestyle, to stay alive and healthy. Here are more panda facts that will make you love them even more.

Be glad you’re not a panda

Sure, it might seem like a nice life just to sit around all day and snack on your favorite food. But know that if you were a giant panda, you’d need to get off your couch and visit the bathroom a lot. According to the IUCN, a panda poops at least 100 times a day. Plus, when the bamboo in their territory is gone, pandas have to migrate to search for more.

Leave me alone!

Pascale Gueret/Getty ImagesPandas generally like to be by themselves. They do get together to mate in the spring and a mother will raise her cub until it’s 18 to 24 months old, but otherwise, pandas prefer to be alone with their bamboo. Interestingly enough, studies show that pandas “talk” when they do get together.

Here’s what we do know: Pandas rely on their excellent sense of smell to help avoid one another, says National Geographic. They also use smell to find a mate when they’re ready to have a break from all of that alone time.

Why do pandas do handstands?

While pandas generally prefer to sit around by themselves and eat, they can sometimes be seen doing acrobatics. Pandas mark their territories to tell other pandas who they are and to stay away. Their scent gland is underneath their tails, and they rub this area on trees. In order to get the mark as high as possible on a tree (showing that they’re a great big panda that other pandas should avoid), pandas will do a handstand. Plus, adds LiveScience.com, pandas like to hang in trees and do somersaults when they play.

Are they bears, or aren’t they?

Before scientists were able to test panda DNA, they thought that giant pandas might be part of the raccoon family, another animal that has black markings around its eyes. But it is now confirmed that the panda is part of the bear family. That’s unlike the koala bear, which isn’t a bear at all. It is, however, one of these 11 animals with surprisingly misleading names.

Pandas are different from bears in many ways. They don’t store fat and hibernate like their North American bear cousins. They have an extra-long wrist bone that acts like a thumb to make it easier to hold onto bamboo. And technically, the giant panda is classified as a carnivore. Even though they mostly eat bamboo, they will also occasionally eat fish, rats, and other small animals.

And here’s another fun animal comparison: In Mandarin, the name of the giant panda translates as “giant bear cat,” perhaps because of their cat-like vertical pupils or maybe because they like to lie around all day like cats.

The size of a stick of butter

John Moore/Getty ImagesGiant pandas are truly giant when fully grown—males weigh about 300 pounds. But the WWF reports that panda newborns are 1/900th the size of their mamas. They weigh four to six ounces at birth, approximately the same size and weight as a stick of butter in your fridge. When they’re born, baby giant pandas are tiny, pale, and hairless. They only get their distinctive black and white fur when they’re about a month old. Here are some adorable pictures of baby animals you’ll love instantly.

Living fossils

Pandas International calls giant pandas “living fossils” because the species is thought to have existed for three million years. In order to prevent pandas from going extinct, we need to protect the animals and their habitat, as well as help them reproduce in panda breeding centers. So much of the world’s wildlife is at risk and in need of protection—for example, do you know how many cheetahs are left in the world?

How to help giant pandas

Donating to animal conservation organizations like the WWF is a great way to help pandas and to prevent their populations from shrinking. With the WWF, you can even adopt a panda. Pandas are particularly important to the WWF—the group has used the panda as its logo since it was founded in 1961.

Another simple way you can help? By visiting a panda in a zoo. China leases pandas to zoos around the world and uses the funds to preserve pandas in the wild. In China, you can see newborn, baby, and adult pandas at panda centers such as the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Nature lovers will be able to watch a livestream of a peregrine falcon nest in downtown Richmond for the fourth year in a row.

The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries has set up a live video feed of the nest on the 21st floor of the Riverfront Plaza building.

The feed is available for viewing online.

The department said in a news release that wildlife officials have confirmed that last year’s new male that is identifiable by his bands is back again with an unbanded female.

Officials said the return of the male falcon is a sign of some stability, and they are optimistic that the pair will breed successfully.

Bengwayan

From the northern shores of Batanes to the southern coast of Sulu, some 7,100 islands rise from the surface of the Pacific. Most were once biodiversity-rich islands, pock-marked by ancient high volcanoes, mountain ranges and atolls which poke their heads above the blue surface. Many imagine the islands of Palawan, Cebu, Bohol, Negros and the deep waters reaching a depth of 11 kilometers, rich with corals, fishes of all kind and what is believed the energy of the future, deuterium.

The archipelago was besieged by super powers in the past, its territories still threatened now because of suspected rich oil and mineral deposits.

But the worst threat is internal. Citizen-initiated, aggressive, relentless, unethical to a point God-less. As if the future does not matter.

The world’s second largest archipelago country after Indonesia, the Philippines includes more than 7,100 islands covering 297,179 km2 in the westernmost Pacific Ocean. The Philippines lies north of Indonesia and directly east of Vietnam. The country is one of the few nations that is, in its entirety, both a hotspot and a megadiversity country, placing it among the top priority hotspots for global conservation

The archipelago is formed from a series of isolated fragments that have long and complex geological histories, some dating back 30-50 million years. With at least 17 active volcanoes, these islands are part of the “Ring of Fire” of the Pacific Basin. The archipelago stretches over 1,810 kilometers from north to south. Northern Luzon is only 240 kilometers from Taiwan (with which it shares some floristic affinities), and the islands off southwestern Palawan are only 40 kilometers from Malaysian Borneo. The island of Palawan, which is separated from Borneo by a channel some 145 meters deep, has floristic affinities with both the Philippines and Borneo in the Sundaland Hotspot, and strong faunal affinities with the Sunda Shelf.

Hundreds of years ago, most of the Philippine islands were covered in rain forest. The bulk of the country was blanketed by lowland rainforests dominated by towering dipterocarps (Dipterocarpaceae), prized for their beautiful and straight hardwood. At higher elevations, the lowland forests are replaced by montane and mossy forests that consist mostly of smaller trees and vegetation. Small regions of seasonal forest, mixed forest and savanna, and pine-dominated cloud forest covered the remaining land area.

Unique and Threatened Biodiversity

The patchwork of isolated islands, the tropical location of the country, and the once extensive areas of rainforest have resulted in high species diversity in some groups of organisms and a very high level of endemism. There are five major and at least five minor centers of endemism, ranging in size from Luzon, the largest island (103,000 km2), which, for example, has at least 31 endemic species of mammals, to tiny Camiguin Island (265 km2) speck of land north of Mindanao, which has at least two species of endemic mammals. The Philippines has among the highest rates of discovery in the world with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years. Because of this, the rate of endemism for the Philippines has risen and likely will continue to rise.

Plants

At the very least, one-third of the more than 9,250 vascular plant species native to the Philippines are endemic. Plant endemism in the hotspot is mostly concentrated at the species level; there are no endemic plant families and 26 endemic genera. Gingers, begonias, gesneriads, orchids, pandans, palms, and dipterocarps are particularly high in endemic species. For example, there are more than 150 species of palms in the hotspot, and around two-thirds of these are found nowhere else in the world. Of the 1,000 species of orchids found in the Philippines, 70 percent are restricted to the hotspot.

The broad lowland and hill rain forests of the Philippines, which are mostly gone today, were dominated by at least 45 species of dipterocarps. These massive trees were the primary canopy trees from sea level to 1,000 meters. Other important tree species here include giant figs (Ficus spp.), which provide food for fruit bats, parrots, and monkeys, and Pterocarpus indicus, like the dipterocarps, is valued for its timber.

Birds

There are over 530 bird species found in the Philippines hotspot; about 185 of these are endemic (35 percent) and over 60 are threatened. BirdLife International has identified seven Endemic Bird Areas (EBAs in this hotspot: Mindoro, Luzon, Negros and Panay, Cebu, Mindanao and the Eastern Visayas, the Sulu archipelago, and Palawan. Like other taxa, birds exhibit a strong pattern of regional endemism. Each EBA supports a selection of birds not found elsewhere in the hotspot. The hotspot also has a single endemic bird family, the Rhabdornithidae, represented by the Philippine creepers (Rhabdornis spp.). In May 2004, a possibly new species of rail Gallirallus was observed on Calayan island in the Babuyan islands, northern Philippines. It is apparently most closely related to the Okinawa rail (Gallirallus okinawae) from the Ryukyu islands, Japan.

Perhaps the best-known bird species in the Philippines is the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi, CR), the second-largest eagle in the world. The Philippine eagle breeds only in primary lowland rain forest. Habitat destruction has extirpated the eagle everywhere except on the islands of Luzon, Mindanao and Samar, where the only large tracts of lowland rain forest remain. Today, the total population is estimated at less than 700 individuals. Captive breeding programs have been largely unsuccessful; habitat protection is the eagle’s only hope for survival.

Among the hotspots other threatened endemic species are the Negros bleeding art (Gallicolumba keayi, CR), Visayan wrinkled hornbill (Aceros waldeni, CR), Scarlet-collared flowerpecker (Dicaeum retrocinctum, VU), Cebu flowerpecker (Dicaeum quadricolor, CR), and Philippine cockatoo (Cacatua haematuropygia, CR).

Mammals

At least 165 mammal species are found in the Philippine hotspot, and over 100 of these are endemic (61 percent), one of the highest levels of mammal endemism in any hotspot. Endemism is high at the generic level as well, with 23 of 83 genera endemic to the hotspot. Rodent diversification in the Philippines is comparable with the radiation of honeycreepers in the Hawaiian Islands and finches in the Galapagos.

The largest and most impressive of the mammals in the Philippines is the tamaraw (Bubalus mindorensis, CR), a dwarf water buffalo that lives only on Mindoro Island. A century ago the population numbered 10,000 individuals; today only a few hundred animals exist in the wild. Other mammals endemic to the Philippines include: the Visayan and Philippine warty pigs (Sus cebifrons, CR and S. philippensis, VU); the Calamianes hog-deer (Axis calamaniensis, EN) and the Visayan spotted deer (Rusa alfredi, EN), which has been reduced to a population of a few hundred on the islands of Negros, Masbate and Panay; and the golden-capped fruit bat (Acerodon jubatus, EN), which, as the world’s largest bat, has a wingspan up to 1.7 meters.

The Negros naked-backed fruit bat (Dobsonia chapmani), which was thought to be extinct in the Philippines, has recently been rediscovered, on the islands of Cebu in 2000 and Negros in 2003.

Reptiles

Reptiles are represented by about 235 species, some 160 of which are endemic (68 percent). Six genera are endemic, including the snake genus Myersophis, which is represented by a single species, Myersophis alpestris, on Luzon. The Philippine flying lizards from the genus Draco are well represented here, with about 10 species. These lizards have a flap of skin on either side of their body, which they use to glide from trees to the ground.

An endemic freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis, CR) is considered the most threatened crocodilian in the world. In 1982, wild populations totaled only 500-1000 individuals; by 1995 a mere 100 crocodiles remained in natural habitats. The recent discovery of a population of this species in the Sierra Madre of Luzon brings new hope for its conservation, as does the implementation of projects aimed at raising awareness and protecting the crocodileâ€™s habitat. The Crocodile Rehabilitation, Observance and Conservation (CROC) Project of the Mabuwaya Foundation is active in carrying out such projects.

Other unique and threatened reptiles include Gray’s monitor (Varanus olivaceus, VU) and the Philippine pond turtle (Heosemys leytensis, CR). A newly discovered monitor lizard, Varanus mabitang, from Panay is only the second monitor species known in the world to specialize on a fruit diet.

Amphibians

There are nearly 90 amphibian species in the hotspot, almost 85 percent of which are endemic; these totals continue to increase, with the continuing discovery and description of new species. One interesting amphibian, the panther flying frog (Rhacophorus pardalis), has special adaptations for gliding, including extra flaps of skin and webbing between fingers and toes to generate lift during glides. The frog glides down from trees to breed in plants suspended above stagnant bodies of water. The frog genus Platymantis is particularly well represented with some 26 species, all of which are endemic; of these, 22 are considered threatened. The young of all Platymantis species undergo direct development, bypassing the tadpole stage. The hotspot is also home to the Philippine flat-headed frog (Barbourula busuangensis, VU), one of the world’s most primitive frog species.

Freshwater Fish

The Philippines has more than 280 inland fish, including nine endemic genera and more than 65 endemic species, many of which are confined to single lakes. An example is Sardinella tawilis, a freshwater sardine found only in Taal Lake. Sadly, Lake Lanao, in Mindanao, seems likely to have become the site of one of the hotspots worst extinction catastrophes, with nearly all of the lakes endemic fish species now almost certainly extinct, primarily due to the introduction of exotic species (like Tilapia).

Invertebrates

About 70 percent of the Philippines nearly 21,000 recorded insect species are found only in this hotspot. About one-third of the 915 butterflies found here are endemic to the Philippines, and over 110 of the more than 130 species of tiger beetle are found nowhere else.

But Where Are the Forests

The Philippine forests are rapidly disappearing. By 2025, there may be no virgin forests, many forestry experts predict. Non-believers scoff at this, saying it is an exaggeration. But the figures cannot be wrong. The effects of deforestation are not figments of imagination. The worsening poverty caused by inadequate and ruined natural resources are real.

The rate of deforestation in the country is among the highest in the world. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, in 1934, 57 percent of the country or 42 million acres were forested, 26 million acres of which was primary or virgin forests. In a span of 50 years, almost two thirds of the forests was lost to deforestation as indicated in a study by Frances Korten of the Ford Foundation in 1990. It found out that the country’s forest was down to only 16 million acres, 1 million of which was virgin forests.

But the worst deforestation happened during the period of 1990 to 1999 where 750,000 acres of virgin forest were lost. Today, only 1.75 million acres remain of the nation’s virgin forests.

The loss is incredible, the rate of deforestation in that decade was almost 75,000 acres a year. It also came at a time when logging ban was imposed in some selected sites in the country.

As a result, flooding, soil erosion and degradation pegged at 100,000 tons of soil yearly, loss of species diversity and genetic material, loss of human lives and properties and aesthetic and recreational loss were at their worst.

Much of the blame I on governments that over the years have passed laws favorable to logging concessions and implemented forest protection poorly.

Unchecked illegal logging remains the main culprit, government negligence has prompted the devastation of forest. Today, much of the remaining forests are still being invaded by commercial loggers.

The country was Asia’s greatest exporter of rainforest timber since 1920s and remained so until 1960. However, overzealous extraction, disregard for future supply and poor logging practices, exacerbated by illegal logging, have effectively destroyed the industry and severely degraded much of the remaining forest.

Philippine forestry laws passed since 1930 have failed to provide adequate security provisions for virgin and secondary growth forests, thus the forests had virtually no protection at all. For instance, there is only one forest guard for every 7,500 acres.

But even then, many official policies and strategies from the very start were faulty. Laws that required harvesting on a sustained yield basis were lacking, the logging industry lacked supervision, little attention has been paid to selective logging and timber extraction methods allowed logs to be taken even from extremely steep and fragile slopes.

Although it was obvious by the early seventies that forest resources was dwindling rapidly, practices that sustained yield were not heeded. Legislation to phase out raw log exports, in the belief that this lucrative trade was the main cause of overcutting, was first introduced in 1973. However, the ban was never implemented and a modified scheme served to concentrate ownership of timber licenses in the hands of a few Marcos supporters, with little commitment to reducing raw log exports.

Despite a subsequent ban on the export of raw logs since 1986 and the not-so successful community-based forest management there is still a continuing bias towards log production. Even after 1991 when logging was banned in sensitive areas such as virgin forests, in residual forests with a slope of 50 percent or greater and in watershed areas, compliance with the mandatory conditions and prevention of illegal logging is made difficult by insufficient resources.

From 1972 to 1988, the logging industry amassed $42.85 billion in revenues at the rate of $2.65 billion a year. But it also laid to waste some 8.57 million hectares of forests. Over the same period, loggers destroyed 9.6 million acres of virgin forests, raking in $19.4 billion in income.

The country’s forest cover is now only 17 percent, far below the 60 percent required for ideal ecological balance. If the trend continues, there will be no forests by 2050 and that the Philippine hardwoods which used to dominate the forests will be gone.

Decades of forest destruction by wanton and indiscriminate logging have made the country prone to landslides, this has led to the degradation of watersheds which are basically the lifeline of food production and water supply. because of environmental degradation, the Philippines has become one of the most disaster- prone countries in the world where tremendous rise in threats to life, resources and property is always widespread.

Such a situation is difficult to put back into order

Deforestation is the major reason behind flooding, acute water shortages, rapid soil erosion, siltation and mudslides which have proved costly not only to the environment and properties but also in human lives.

Reversing the tremendous forest depletion is a gigantic, if not, an impossible task, considering that the rate of deforestation far outstrips the rate of reforestation.

Social forestry, where forest productivity rests on local community participation, is showing signs of progress in the country. But the strategy is not enough. More so because land ownership and forest management are issues which cannot be separate from each other. The Legal Resources Center (LRC) says that for the government to have an effective forest management program, some of the existing government environmental policies need to be overhauled.

True enough. Many environmental government policies look at conservation without consideration of the rights of the people who live where conservation or environmental programs are. While the Philippine Strategy for Sustainable Development calls for local participation in forestry programs, the truth is, indigenous peoples’ participation is marginal, solicited only for the purpose of lending projects cultural credibility.

Mount Pulag National Park in Benguet is an ideal example. Many times used as a reason to avail of international funding of environmental programs, majority of the people are never involved in a real sense. The Kalanguyas, tired of the exploitative approaches of so- called environmental program implementors, bluntly told the government it has no need of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in the area.



Forestry projects in the Philippines has devoured millions of dollars in loans and grants. But there is little to see. In 1990, the government borrowed $325 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a national reforestation plan. It went to the dogs. The Upland NGO Assistance Committee (UNAC), an umbrella organization of 125 upland NGOS working directly with upland communities concluded that the program was a failure. Politicians meddled in the program, government foresters became contractors, trees species planted were for commercial use, and the reforestation targets were not reached in many parts of the country.

The program was ill- conceived and managed and relied on insufficient data. The function of the multilateral banks is to make hard-currency loans for projects that can generate foreign exchange for repayment. Thus, they are ill-suited to solving environmental problems. ADB’s provision of massive environmental loans to the Philippines accelerated the very damage it intended to reverse.

The continuing loss of forests in the Philippines is a result of combined administrative mismanagement, corruption and social inequity. The value of forests, both as a resource base and as an environmental control, remains undervalued in the face of over-riding economic need."~['CR', 'CR', 'CR', 'CR', 'CR', 'CR', 'CR', 'CR', 'CR']

Now, researchers at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) have discovered that many of these whales have returned—some in large numbers—to South Georgia.

Since the international moratorium on whaling in 1982, decades of protection have allowed the critically endangered blue whale—the largest of these beasts and the largest animal ever to live—to bounce back considerably after losing 97% of the species.

In 2018, the research mission recorded only 1 sighting and several acoustic confirmations of blue whales—but this year’s voyage logged 36 sightings, totaling 55 individuals.

“For such a rare species (blue whale), this is an unprecedented number of sightings and suggests that South Georgia waters remain an important summer feeding ground for this rare and poorly known species,” reads a press release on the British Antarctic Survey website.

The 2020 expedition also found evidence of around 20,000 humpback whales, and managed to satellite tag several rare southern right whales.

“After three years of surveys, we are thrilled to see so many whales visiting South Georgia to feed again,” says team leader Dr. Jennifer Jackson, a whale biologist at the BAS. “This is a place where both whaling and sealing were carried out extensively. It is clear that protection from whaling has worked.”

Speaking with The Independent, Jackson revealed that her team was “thrilled” at the sighting of so many blue whales, which also suggested there is still ample food available for these leviathans.

“Relative to many other oceans on the planet, the Southern Ocean is still relatively pristine, so it still has capacity to support large numbers of whales,” she said.

In a recent presentation to the World Economic Forum, economist Dr. Ralph Chiami and whale biologist Michael Fishbach presented an economic analysis on great whales as agents of climate-change prevention. They estimated that the life of each whale is worth around $2 million dollars because of the massive role they play as storehouses of carbon, due to the enormous amount of feces which feeds the proliferation of phytoplankton—the marine algae that breathe half of the oxygen into planet earth.

No whale is worth more to the public good than the blue, and these massive beasts take more than 33 tons of carbon with them down to Davy Jones’ locker when they die. While alive, their massive “fecal plumes” nourish entire communities of phytoplankton which suck up hundreds of billions of tons of CO2 every year.

The discovery during the BAS 2020 survey has prompted the call for a new assessment of Antarctic blue whale recovery to be conducted by the International Whaling Commission Scientific Committee next year in order to find out how well they are recovering from the whaling years.

else we’d simply lose~"The island of Boracay has once been hailed as the world’s best by “Travel+Leisure” magazine in 2012—only one of the many recognitions this famous Philippine tourist destination has received both here and abroad. Its fine, powdery white sand is its most legendary feature, which has lured local and international tourists alike for decades.

The recent closure of Boracay for environmental rehabilitation has put the spotlight on the island more intensely than ever and for not so flattering reasons. Business activity and tourism have been halted, and locals are contending with decreased livelihood during the rehabilitation period. However, it has brought important attention to many issues such as waste management, tourism marketing, good business practices and others which, when addressed, will ensure Boracay’s sustainable existence for many more generations to come.

An island paradise

Located about 315 kilometers from the capital city of Metro Manila and 2 kilometers north of Panay Island in the Western Visayas region of the Philippines, Boracay is a small island that is only 7 kilometers long and comprised of just three barangays, namely Yapak in the north, Balabag in the center and Manoc Manoc in the south.

Aside from the several beaches, Boracay also boasts of lush forests across the island. For trekkers and hikers, Mt. Luho is a famous destination, with a peak that offers a breathtaking view of the coastlines especially those located in Yapak. A wildlife reserve can also be found where different types of snakes, monkeys and birds reside.

The high season of Boracay is from December to April, where accommodations are difficult to find especially if you don’t plan and book accommodations before going to the island. May to June is also ideal, as these months are the Philippines’ summer season, but the temperature can get very high. July to November is the low season, when accommodations are relatively cheaper.

What’s in a name?

Boracay was originally known as the “Land of the Atis,” named after its indigenous inhabitants—the Negrito or Ati. One well-known theory as to how the island got its name is that “Boracay” was derived from a local term “borac” meaning cotton, which may mean that there used to be vast cotton fields in the island or that the powdery sand of the beaches are apt to be described as soft and almost cotton-like in texture.

According to other accounts, when Spaniards arrived and set foot on the island, they picked up shells on the shore and asked the Atis what the items were called, and they replied “sigay.” Later, the Spaniards asked them what they were planting and the Atis then answered that they were planting “boray.” a certain vegetable seed. From the words “boray” and “sigay” the name Boracay was thus formed.

Finally, the most well-known theory is that Boracay came from the word “bora,” which means bubbles. The natives noticed the foamy appearance that the waves make when they crash into the shore, very much like frothy bubbles, thus the name.

Claim to fame

How and when did this small island off the coast of Aklan catch the world’s attention? Boracay came under the public radar when German writer Jens Peter published a book about the Philippines and particularly wrote about the exotic beauty of the small island back in 1978. International films like “Too Late The Hero” and “Nam’s Angels” also utilized Boracay as one of their filming locations back in the 1970s, and this is largely seen as a contributing factor to the island’s growing popularity as a tourist destination by the early 1980s.

Before the entry of tourism, the Boracaynons—the people living in Boracay—made their livelihood through fishing and coconut plantation in the 1940s and 50s. Copra, the dried meat of the coconut, was used to trade with the people of Aklan for other goods and staples such as rice.

An estimated 2.1 million tourists are reported to have visited Boracay in 2017, the highest number so far and a significant increase of 16% from 2016 figures. Most of the tourists come from China, followed closely by South Korea. Because of this burgeoning tourist activity, it comes as no surprise that Boracay earned an impressive total of P56 billion, according to the Aklan Provincial Tourism Office.

When in Boracay

White Beach in Boracay is the most popular and lively coastline in the island, dotted with different restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops. Considered as the island’s epicenter of activities, this is where the Boracay nightlife is located. Various bars and clubs also line the shores of White Beach, where tourists have drinks and let loose.

Those seeking a more laid-back tropical vacation can choose elsewhere in the island. Boracay actually has eleven other beautiful beaches to explore—two of which, though, are secret in location and not accessible by any public roads, quite hidden from the view of the general crowd. Some can only be reached by trekking through Boracay’s forests. Luxurious resorts and five-star hotels usually have their own private beachfronts exclusive to their guests.

For backpackers & budget travelers, Boracay also has a lot of budget-friendly lodging. In fact, there are more of these pension-type lodging than formal hotels all over the island, making Boracay a popular destination for groups of friends and large families.

Aside from swimming and snorkeling, visitors can enjoy many other outdoor sports and activities such as beach volleyball, cliff diving and parasailing. Paraw or boat sailing and riding on water contraptions like the fish flying are also popular.

Nature Haven

The Boracay bat cave located in the western part of the island is a well-known local destination. Conservationists have put a lot of effort in preserving the homes of these fruit bats and have since identified a total of three bat species including the Golden-Crowned Flying Fox which belongs to the endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List.

Fruit bats are highly significant in the island’s ecosystem as they have an important role in tree regeneration, which preserves the Boracay forest cover. They disperse seeds as they take flight, scattering them all over the land. This natural activity accounts for as much as 95 percent of the regrowth of the island’s forests, a phenomenon that is extremely vital as the island’s forested area is now known to be dwindling slowly.

Action is being taken to save the fruit bats because their population in the island has reportedly taken a whopping 86 percent decrease from 1988 to 2005, according to various conservation groups. This is because they are losing their natural habitat and are sometimes being hunted. Organizations such as the Friends of the Flying Foxes (FFF) are known to heavily campaign for the preservation of the various fruit bats species in Boracay.

Environmental Conservation

Due to the influx of tourists in Boracay, pollution and overdevelopment has been a concern. Despite the impression that the island enjoys year-round popularity, the truth is that there has already been a drop in tourist visits as early as in 1997 due to consistently high coliform levels in the waters. The presence of coliform means that water has been contaminated by feces or sewage.

Moreover, algae bloom has been reported in 2015, illustrating more than ever the deteriorating condition of the island’s natural environment. It is also believed that human activity such as snorkeling and diving has been the cause of damage to as much as 70 percent of Boracay’s coral reefs.

The good news is that significant reef growth has already been seen in the past few years, thanks to ongoing reef rehabilitation initiated by local non-profit environmental organizations. Through transplantation, the population of live corals in the island have been increasing annually since 2015.

Much-Needed Respite

The closure and rehabilitation of Boracay has been deemed a much-needed rest that is for the benefit not only of the island’s natural resources but also of its inhabitants and enterprises. The target reopening of Boracay in October 2018 is highly anticipated, and by the looks of what has been previewed on social media and in mainstream news outlets, the outcome is nothing short of awe-inspiring and fantastic—with the island regaining the crystal-clear quality of its waters and its famous white sand becoming even more inviting.

Many people have affirmed that this is the Boracay that they had known decades ago, before mass tourism and extreme commercialization took place. Even naysayers would be hard-pressed not to be convinced that the clean-up of Boracay has been quite effective.

Moving forward, Filipinos are keeping their fingers crossed that with the right balance of governance and tourist activities, Boracay can remain this way and keep forever its reputation as one of the best beaches in the whole world.

And it looks like they are still on track to the finish date. Hopefully, this rehabilitation fully helps the island heal once more; it doesn’t really matter if the healing takes years.

Lastly, Pres. Duterte has stated that once the rehabilitation is done, he desires to distribute Boracay land to its natives and locals, and not to big businesses. Hopefully, the Ati community would also be included in these plans, and have their land officially be given CADT.

The transition of Boracay Island from a peaceful and quiet stretch of beautiful white sand beaches to a highly commercialized hub of tourists and hotels and colorful nightlife can be a good thing, but everyone should remember that an island as beautiful as Boracay cannot be replaced and should be treasured and well taken-care of. The beauty of this exotic place does not come so effortlessly in this current setting anymore. We need to take care of Boracay, or else we’d simply lose it."~[]

Highlights This particular doggo was mistaken for a lion in Spain.

Those confused by the dog’s appearance complained to the police about a loose lion.

The police department of Molina de Segura took to Twitter to disclose their findings.

People of Spain may have been surprised to see a lion randomly roaming around their local garden; which is what inspired them to contact police officials about this king-of-the-jungle emergency. The police investigated the complaint after which they took to Twitter to make their findings public.

On March 7th, the police’s official Twitter account posted a picture of the crazy furred animal. The caption, according to Google translate, says, “Several notices have been received this morning alerting that a lion had been seen loose in the garden area, others a strange bug, but finally we have passed the microchip reader and it has turned out to be a...dog. Identifying its owner”. The tweet now has 2,400 retweets and 6,700 likes.

Se han recibido esta mañana varios avisos alertando de que habían visto suelto por la zona de huerta un león 🦁, otros un bicho extraño, pero finalmente le hemos pasado el lector de microchip y ha resultado ser un... perro 🐕.

Talk about needing a shave! This doggo is rocking a full mane and it isn’t even no-shave-November yet. One doesn’t need to be a professional dog groomer to realise that this cutie is in dire need of a hair-cut. And the local police force of Molina de Segura, a municipality in Spain, agree. We can only imagine the lecture this canine’s owner is about to get on proper grooming etiquette once identified.

The comment section was filled with hilarious responses for obvious reasons. The police department themselves poked fun that at the situation by tweeting an edited picture of the dog with text in a thought bubble that translates to “quiet agent. wow wow’.

pic.twitter.com/EKHVWhGWds — Policia Local Molina de Segura (@MolinaPolicia) March 7, 2020

A Twitter user posted a meme which showed a stock image of a lion with text on top that translates to “what you order on aliexpress (an online retail service)” and then a picture of this hairy dog with text that says, “what comes to you”.

The theme of expectation vs reality was carried on by another user who tweeted this ‘aww’ inducing video.

Working with Dr. Morne de la Rey of Embryo Plus South Africa, the team performed an ovum pick-up procedure on Nikita, a 9-year-old female southern white rhinoceros at the Safari Park.

The procedure is a non-surgical method of collecting eggs from a live animal modeled on a common method used on cows and horses. Throughout the procedure, Nikita was anesthetized and carefully monitored by a team of more than 30 specialists.

“We are grateful to collaborate with Dr. Morne de la Ray and his team on this important step in our efforts to save the northern white rhino from the brink of extinction,” said Barbara Durrant, director of reproductive sciences at San Diego Zoo Global. “Having viable, fresh eggs is very important to our work. Before OPU, we have only been able to collect eggs after an older animal dies. Older eggs are not very viable; the best eggs come from a living animal.”

“Now, our next step is to learn how to mature these eggs in culture, and how to fertilize them and grow them to the stage needed for embryo transfer,” she said.

Ultimately, scientists hope to use frozen cells preserved from 12 northern white rhinos to create new stem cells that can develop into sperm and eggs. Fertilized embryos would then be transferred to female southern white rhinos as surrogate mothers.

There are many challenges ahead, but researchers say they are optimistic that a northern white rhino calf could be born from these processes within 10 to 15 years. This work also may be applied to other rhino species, including critically endangered Sumatran and Javan rhinos.

The vast expanse of the Gir National Park in Gujarat is home to the endangered Asiatic lions—the only place where they are found in the wild. The population of these majestic cats has soared from a handful in the 19th century to about 600 in 2017, charting one of the success stories in India's conservation history. Apart from the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), Gir also has a sizeable number of another elusive cat—the Indian leopard (Panthera pardus fusca). For centuries, both these apex predators have coexisted, without much competition for survival despite their high numbers. What factors could be fostering this coexistence?

In a new study, researchers at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), Aligarh, have looked into how lions and leopards divide time and space in Gir to coexist. The study is a result of a collaborative effort between the Gujarat Forest Department and the Department of Wildlife Sciences, AMU. The findings of the study, funded by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, was published in the journal PLOS One.

""AMU is monitoring the leopard ecology in Gir from last 18 years under different projects,"" says Mr Rohit Chaudhary, the corresponding author of the study. Previous efforts at AMU, led by Prof Jamal Ahmad Khan, had resulted in a database of leopard ecology in the past. ""These records indicate that both the lions and leopards have high overlap in their diet. It led us to believe that there must be some spatial or temporal partitioning of resources between them,"" he adds, talking about the motivation of the present study.

Previous studies on tigers and leopards in Asia, and lions and leopards in Africa, had indicated that being active at different times of the day (temporal partitioning) or sharing different habitats (spatial partitioning) helped these cats coexist. However, there was no study on lions and leopards in India so far, and this is the first such study to assess spatiotemporal partitioning between them.

The researchers used camera traps in an area of 200 square kilometres in the western part of Gir. They continuously captured sightings of lions and leopards, and their prey animals, during the summer and winter months of 2017. After sanitising their data and removing duplicates, they had 2003 trap nights, with more leopard sightings than lions. Among prey animals, chital had the highest captures, followed by sambar, wild pigs and nilgai.

The study found that both lions and leopards were nocturnal animals, indicating that there was no significant temporal partitioning. However, there was a considerable difference in the types of habitats they preferred. The lions were mostly found in open and dense habitats. On the contrary, the leopards preferred dense habitats and avoided open habitats. The researchers opine that dense habitats create a good cover, thus reducing the encounters between leopards and lions.

The researchers also analysed how lions and leopards overlapped with the prey species, both spatially and temporally. Sambars are the preferred prey of both leopards and lions, while lions also preferred wild pigs. The study found that leopards shared their habitats with sambars and wild pigs while lions shared their habitat with chital and nilgai. So how then do lions hunt their favourite prey?

""Prey animals may venture into lion habitats, which could provide the lions with an opportunity to kill,"" explains Mr Choudhary. Since the lions, sambars and wild pigs are all active during the nights, it may increase the chance of encounters between a lion and its prey.

The findings show how habitat preference could play a significant role in fostering coexistence between two large carnivores.

""Both lion and leopard exist at high densities in Gir. Habitat heterogeneity has an important role in the coexistence of both predators,"" remarks Mr Chaudhary. ""However, habitat preference and its use are not the sole reason for coexistence between leopards and lions. There might be other reasons too,"" he cautions. The researchers stress the need for thorough monitoring of the habitats inside Gir as habitat changes have severe implication on this coexistence. “Any change in the future could have implications on this balance,"" he signs off.

This article has been run past the researchers, whose work is covered, to ensure accuracy.

Taylor was one of four Red Pandas that called ZooMontana home.

At the time of the record, he was a whopping 22-years-old, 14-years-older than his typical wild counterparts.

Through extensive research and proof from ZooMontana, Guinness World Records confirmed the honor and presented the Zoo with an official certificate of the record. In an unfortunate twist of fate, one day prior to the announcement of the record, Taylor passed away peacefully in his sleep on Wednesday, March 11.

ZooMontana’s Executive Director, Jeff Ewelt, was devastated by the loss.

“All of us at ZooMontana are saddened by the loss of Taylor,"" he said. ""He has been a staple within our organization; an animal many of our staff have bonded with. Although these losses are never easy, we are honored that Taylor’s legacy will forever remain in the record books thanks to generosity of Guinness World Records. His twenty-two wonderful years will remain in our memories and in our stories for generations to come. Every day with Taylor was a gift.

Zoo staff say necropsy results showed no major issues and that the death was caused by natural causes.

According to Zookeepers, Taylor was slowing down and blind. He was able to navigate his habitat quite well thanks to both his sense of smell and partner Zoe’s willingness to guide him.

Zoe the Red Panda is also aging, but is a much younger 18. The oldest Red Panda ever to live died at the age of 24, making Taylor the oldest living at the time of the record.

Red Pandas are small mammals found in Asia’s high forests. Once thought to be relatives of the Giant Panda, and even racoons, Red Pandas are the sole living members of their taxonomic family.

They primarily eat bamboo, however, will sometimes eat bugs, fruits and an occasional bird. Like the Giant Panda, they possess a modified wrist bone, or pseudo thumb, that allows them to grasp bamboo stalks.

spotted setting terroritysaid malec “she seems right stuff”~"Coronavirus may be hampering business as usual, but high up in UC Berkeley’s Campanile, peregrine falcon couple Annie and Grinnell — who’ve raised chicks on the bell tower since 2017 — are carrying out their spring routine without a hitch: mating, nesting and reproducing. The first two rusty-brown speckled eggs of the season have appeared — one on Tuesday night, the other this morning (Friday, March 13). The events were captured by one of three webcams on the tower and viewed by the birds’ fan base, which now stretches across 45 countries.

“Congratulations! Our office, along with the rest of Berkeley, is looking forward to meeting our newest residents,” tweeted one admirer, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, a campus alumnus.

“Life goes on. Wonderful,” a Cal Falcons Facebook follower wrote.

Mary Malec, a local volunteer raptor nest monitor who accurately predicted March 10 for the arrival of egg No. 1, said that late Tuesday night this week, “I was getting a little worried, because I had only about half an hour left until midnight. But it arrived at 11:21.”

It takes six to seven days for a full clutch to be laid; the last of Annie’s eggs — if she lays four, she said — could appear next Wednesday. She’ll start incubating them after the third one, so that her young hatch about the same time. People shouldn’t worry, Malec added, if they see Annie occasionally apart from the first two eggs.

“It’s called synchronous hatching, when the chicks are born within a few hours of each other, even though the eggs were laid days apart,” she explained.

Annie and Grinnell “now have quite a bit of experience, so they’re probably at peak of their game, and they’re in the prime of their lives,” said Lynn Schofield, a biologist with The Institute for Bird Populations. She and her husband, Sean Peterson, a Berkeley Ph.D. student in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, launched the Cal Falcons social media project in 2019. “We hope they’ll get four chicks, that’s the maximum,” she added. “We’re crossing our fingers.”

Last year, Annie produced four eggs, but broke the first one accidentally. Chicks later named Cade and Carson emerged from eggs two and three; the fourth chick didn’t hatch.

Peterson says it’s the perfect time for viewers to check the webcams, as “the laying process is good action. Once Annie starts incubating, she’ll mostly be hanging out for about 32 to 33 days,” until the chicks hatch.

Before the egg-laying began, Annie voted in the California primary election and looked at paint chips for the chicks’ nursery, thanks to social media posts by Schofield and Peterson, who use Instagram, Facebook and Twitter to educate and delight the falcons’ followers — who number in the thousands — with facts, short videos, close-up shots from long-focus lenses and occasional humorous photo-edited images of the birds.

This spring, Cal Falcons is offering new ways to engage with the birds and the scientists and wildlife experts who know them best. As of mid-February, Annie and Grinnell have one-stop shop website with access to their livestreams, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. There’s also a page to meet the scientists and learn their favorite falcon facts, a list of the partners in this scientific and educational falcon project, a falcon FAQ, a falcon glossary that defines terms like floaters, tiercels and eyrie and an “Ask a Scientist” form.

“It’s so nice to have falcon activity happening on a college campus, where we can aim for education, not just entertainment,” said Malec, who is affiliated with the East Bay Regional Parks District. “Most of our posts are fact-based and pretty interesting and professional.”

Another new addition this year is a permanent ethernet cable in the Campanile that will provide a stable connection for the webcams. Campus administrators responded favorably to a request last fall for funding, about $13,000, for the cable, said Carla Cicero, staff curator of birds at the campus’s Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and a liaison to the administration for the coalition of on- and off-campus experts who manage the falcon project.

A Cal Falcons crowdfunding effort in late 2018 raised over $14,500 for the first two webcams and a temporary cable for internet hook-up, which arrived in time for the 2019 nesting season. A third video camera was added last fall, with leftover funds, followed by the long-lasting cable.

That’s good news for those glued to the 24/7 falcon cams. The newest one, for example, allows views of Annie and Grinnell’s day-to-day lives from the tower’s southwest corner, where Grinnell recently brought Annie a red-winged blackbird, shorebirds and acorn woodpeckers to eat.

“We’ve seen a lot more prey exchanges between Annie and Grinnell, more courtship behavior and mating and more of where Grinnell is spending time roosting,” said Schofield.

There’s hope that, like last year, a Hatch Day party can be scheduled — in 2019 it was held April 25 at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, where the chicks’ emergence was livestreamed on BAMPFA’s giant outdoor screen. The San Francisco Bay Area chapter of the Feminist Bird Club stands ready to offer an additional birding event on campus that day, said Schofield, so that “people can go bird watching around campus and maybe see Grinnell” while Annie’s on the nest.

As in previous years, the baby birds will be named at the beginning of May through a campus community naming competition.

Cal Falcons will soon launch an online T-shirt fundraiser to support Berkeley’s falcons and their care and keeping. The $20 blue and gold fan gear for kids and adults will sport two falcons swooping around the Campanile.

And, there’s one more update: Annie and Grinnell aren’t just expecting, they’re also expectant grandparents. Lawrencium, or “Larry,” a female born on the tower in 2018, has been living on Alcatraz Island, where researchers performing seabird studies saw her last April with a male falcon sitting nearby. Recently, rangers there spotted her setting up a terrority.

Said Malec, “She seems to be doing all the right stuff.”"~[]

Here at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s Asia Trail exhibit, we are celebrating with giant pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian, as well as our red panda pair, Asa and Jackie. We look forward to special days like these because they give us an opportunity to get extra creative with planning our animals’ activities for the day.

It goes without saying that both giant and red pandas are incredibly charismatic and intelligent. Today and every day, we encourage them to keep physically active and mentally sharp by presenting them with a variety of enrichment. This can be anything from sensory experiences (like spices for scent-anointing or a tub full of bubbles for popping), to physical objects and toys (like boomer balls and puzzle feeders), to social interactions (like husbandry training sessions or painting with keepers) and environmental stimuli (like giving them access to a different yard or adding new groundcover to explore).

No matter which activity or experience we give the pandas, it is important that they have an opportunity to use their natural behaviors and choose how to spend their time. In honor of national panda day, let’s take a look at some of our giant and red pandas’ favorite enrichment activities!"~[]

luck soon hope hear news successful implantation surrogate mom  throw worldwide baby shower bouncing baby northern white rhino whose birth serve beacon hope dying~"The northern white rhino population is in jeopardy The northern white rhino is one of the animal kingdom’s many majestic giants, but years of poaching has taken a toll on their population. From 1970 to 1980, their numbers plummeted from 500 to 15 as illegal hunters pursued white rhinos for the ivory of their horns.

Things started to turn around during the 1990s and 2000s, groups and individuals began to crack down on poachers within the white rhinos’ range. As a result, the population of white rhinos in the wild recovered slightly, peaking at around 32 individuals. Since 2003, the rate of white rhino poaching has been on the rise and has affected the animals’ numbers. As of 2008, northern white rhinos have been declared extinct in the wild, and in 2018, the last male northern white rhino died. Now, there are only two of these magnificent beasts left on Earth. Both of them are females.

Critically endangered (possibly extinct in the wild) Najin and Fatu are the last two northern white rhinos in existence. They live at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya, and they could be the species’ last hope for the future. In 2014, keepers in the Czech Republic collected sperm samples from a male northern white rhino living in their care. Those samples were frozen and stored, and later, they were used in an attempt to breed Najin and Fatu. Both attempts at inducing pregnancies in the two female rhinos were unsuccessful, forcing scientists to consider new methods of approach for saving the white rhinos from extinction. It is with great sadness that Ol Pejeta Conservancy and the Dvůr Králové Zoo announce that Sudan, the world’s last male northern white rhino, age 45, died at Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya on March 19th, 2018 (yesterday). #SudanForever #TheLoneBachelorGone #Only2Left pic.twitter.com/1ncvmjZTy1 — Ol Pejeta (@OlPejeta) March 20, 2018

Typically, when a species is placed on the endangered list, a recovery plan is established by whatever local conservancy group oversees the population. From there, breeding programs of captive individuals are used to begin bolstering the number of individuals on the planet. When healthy breeding populations have been established, in most cases, reintroduction begins. Small populations of the species are released into the wild to begin repopulation. However, in the case of the northern white rhinos, scientists and conservationists alike have been stuck at step two for decades.

Finding a workaround Unwillingness and inability to breed aren’t uncommon among captive species and individuals, and in most cases, zoos can jockey animals around until a pair matches and produces offspring. In the case of Najin and Fatu, the options for procreation are far more limited. Even the fallback of artificial insemination isn’t working for them, so what are scientists to do? We’ve revived entire species from the dead before, but it has never been an easy task. Fortunately, the world of reproductive sciences has been evolving quickly, and conservationists and animal experts now have myriad options to choose from when it comes to creating new life. Neither surviving female is healthy enough to birth live young. Aside from that, there is the added challenge of finding an option that preserves the northern white rhino genome while maintaining high enough levels of viability.

One possible route to repopulation involves approaching conventional methods from a new and enlightened angle. Although neither Najin nor Fatu can bear young, they both still produce viable egg cells, which can be harvested, frozen, and kept in a lab. Much like humans undergoing fertility therapy or other conception aids, the grandmother-granddaughter pair or northern white rhinos can hope for success through in-vitro fertilization. This method of conception combines sperm and multiple egg cells in an external environment before implanting them in a host mother. By using multiple eggs during the in-vitro process, the chances for success, even in females with fertility issues, is significantly increased. In some fortunate cases, the method is so effective, and it results in multiple pregnancies. Once the sperm has fertilized the eggs, the cells are transferred to a living host. Doing things the old-fashioned way While Najin and Fatu may not be the physical mothers of any of their calves, modern reproductive science has made it possible for their genes to be passed on to another generation. How? with modern science, a surrogate mother from the thriving population of southern white rhinos could become the mother to their children. The two types of animals have similar enough reproductive organs and their eggs could be used in place of Najin or Fatu’s. While the animals are compatible, gathering eggs from them is a far more complicated procedure. Researchers working on bringing back the northern white rhinos have managed to gather a few eggs so far, but not nearly enough to repopulate an entire species. It’s no secret that rhinoceroses are large animals. Just as cattle and horses have significantly larger hearts than we humans do, rhinos have much larger reproductive organs. Locating and withdrawing eggs from a rhino’s ovaries is a far greater ordeal than it is for humans. To complicate matters further, the ovaries of a southern white rhino are located three to four feet from her rump, and the veterinarian seeking to collect the eggs must guide a probe that distance up her rectum and into an ovary before using a catheter to remove the eggs. The procedure is anything but easy. In addition to the difficulty involved in the process of extracting eggs, the success rate of current methods is hardly ideal. Researchers working on bringing back the northern white rhinos have managed to gather a few eggs so far, but not nearly enough to repopulate an entire species. Sandbox cells The odds of reestablishing a sustainable population of northern white rhinos through in-vitro fertilization and surrogacy currently seem pretty slim. Fortunately for the rhinos, science has a few other methods up its sleeve. In the last decade, stem cell research has gone from a thing of whimsy to an advanced field of study that continues to improve by leaps and bounds with every passing year. Its applications are seemingly endless, and they just might be the answer that the northern white rhino conservationists have been looking for. Stem cells are sort of like biological canvases. They come in different varieties: Totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent, and unipotent. Each of these types has unique limitations and can be found in various sources from embryonic tissue to adult bone marrow. To make baby rhinos, scientists have been focused on induced pluripotent stem cells, which are gathered and grown from the skin of adult white rhinos A cell from your bicep and a cell from your gametes (sperm or egg) both hold the same blueprints; they just come in different packaging. Pluripotent cells behave similarly to embryonic stem cells, which can be coaxed into becoming just about any other type of cell. In this case, even though the original cells were taken from the skin of adult rhinos, they can be trained to become something different, such as egg cells. Using what knowledge we currently have of stem cells and their manipulation, scientists can tell a northern white rhino’s skin cell to become a viable egg or sperm cell. From there, they can attempt in-vitro fertilization and implantation into a surrogate, even without fertile parents. The method is still in its infancy, but it has been successfully carried out more than once. Increasing population through embryos With stem cells as a backup and surrogates abound, Najin and Fatu have plenty of options. In late 2019, conservationists and rhinos alike received promising news. Eggs gathered from the two northern white rhinos had been fertilized and resulted in successful embryos. Those embryos were frozen in liquid nitrogen and prepared for a long journey. Waiting down in southern Africa are the lucky mamas who will become the surrogates for the next generation of northern white rhinos. The embryos have quite a ways to travel before they can be implanted. After that, they can grow within their new mother for the 16 to 18-month gestation period typical of white rhinos. Although the methods of creating viable embryos are currently long, challenging, and not terribly efficient, these babies-to-be are incredibly promising first steps. In addition to the two successful in-vitro attempts in September, December of 2019 saw the creation of a third viable embryo. 2020 will undoubtedly see further attempts at creating more embryos. With luck, we can soon hope to hear news of successful implantations in surrogate moms. In 2021, we can throw a worldwide baby shower for some bouncing baby northern white rhinos, whose births will serve as a beacon of hope for a dying species."~[]

Africom on 16 March said out of an abundance of caution, the decision to cancel the exercise was made based on international travel restrictions associated with COVID-19 and to minimize the risk of exposure to US and partner nation service members.

African Lion was scheduled to take place from 23 March to 4 April in Morocco, Tunisia, and Senegal. US Africa Command previously released on 10 March that the exercise would be scaled back to protect against COVID-19.

While African Lion 2020 has been cancelled, planning continues for 2021.







The exercise is the latest in a series of local and international events to be cancelled due to the coronavirus. Last week Africom announced it was cancelling the multinational maritime exercise Obangame Express off West Africa. The US Navy’s Arleigh Burke class destroyer USS Carney arrived in Cape Town over the weekend on its way to take part in the exercise but will now instead embark on a routine patrol in the European and African areas of operation."~['US', 'US']

Annie and Grinnell have raised their chicks in the Campanile since 2017. This year, Annie laid three eggs between March 1o and the early hours of March 16 and is expected to lay her fourth egg in two to three days, according to East Bay Regional Park District volunteer raptor coordinator Mary Malec.

“Most peregrines lay four eggs. Occasionally they will lay five, and fairly frequently they will stop at three,” Malec said. “In 2019 and 2018, (Annie) laid four eggs each time, so her pattern is to lay four eggs — that’s kind of what we expect.”

Malec added that peregrines give birth to broods once a year, this being Annie and Grinnell’s fourth time. She added that Annie was observed to start full-time incubation after she laid her third egg and that it will take 33 to 34 days for the eggs to hatch.

During the falcons’ first year on campus, one of Annie’s two hatchlings died after hitting a building. To try to decrease the danger that falcons face, researchers installed bird-safe streamers on windows near the Evans Hall balcony and other possibly dangerous places, according to Malec.

Historically, the population of peregrine falcons was once endangered when DDT, a chemical once used as insecticide, was found to thin the shells of eggs. Malec holds a positive attitude regarding the current situation of peregrines and added that the current population of peregrines is “robust.”

“The goal of both the education and the wonder of it all is to build respect for peregrines and how difficult their life is and how lucky we are to have them be doing really well,” Malec said.

their nest atop Cal’s Campanile for the past three years are back — and they have laid three eggs so far.



Wild animals are blissfully unaware of the public health crisis engulfing the globe. Which is one reason watching birds of prey go about their ordinary lives via webcam can be both therapeutic and mesmerizing. The peregrine falcons that have made their nest atop UC Berkeley’s Campanile for the past three years are back. Since the story below was posted, a third egg has been laid and Sean Peterson — a Berkeley Ph.D. student who, with his wife, biologist Lynn Schofield, oversees the Cal Falcon social project — told Berkeleyside a fourth one may appear Wednesday afternoon (we’ll keep you posted!). Either way, hard incubation has begun, Peterson said, and hatch day is forecast to be April 18. Many people are following the birds on the three webcams installed on the tower. “People are telling us it reminds them there’s an outside world during the lockdown, “said Peterson, referring to the Bay Area’s current shelter-in-place order. “It gives people some sanity at this crazy time.” — Tracey Taylor / Berkeleyside

Coronavirus may be hampering business as usual, but high up in UC Berkeley’s Campanile, peregrine falcon couple Annie and Grinnell — who’ve raised chicks on the bell tower since 2017 — are carrying out their spring routine without a hitch: mating, nesting and reproducing. Three rusty-brown speckled eggs of the season have already appeared, and the events were captured by one of three webcams on the tower and viewed by the birds’ fan base, which now stretches across 45 countries.

“Congratulations! Our office, along with the rest of Berkeley, is looking forward to meeting our newest residents,” tweeted one admirer, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguín, a campus alumnus.

“Life goes on. Wonderful,” a Cal Falcons Facebook follower wrote.

Mary Malec, a local volunteer raptor nest monitor who accurately predicted March 10 for the arrival of egg No. 1, said that late on Tuesday last week, “I was getting a little worried, because I had only about half an hour left until midnight. But it arrived at 11:21.”

It takes six to seven days for a full clutch to be laid; the last of Annie’s eggs — if she lays four, she said — could appear Wednesday. She’ll start incubating them after the third one, so that her young hatch about the same time. People shouldn’t worry, Malec added, if they see Annie occasionally apart from the first two eggs.

“It’s called synchronous hatching, when the chicks are born within a few hours of each other, even though the eggs were laid days apart,” she explained.

Annie and Grinnell “now have quite a bit of experience, so they’re probably at peak of their game, and they’re in the prime of their lives,” said Lynn Schofield, a biologist with The Institute for Bird Populations. She and her husband, Sean Peterson, a Berkeley Ph.D. student in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management, launched the Cal Falcons social media project in 2019. “We hope they’ll get four chicks, that’s the maximum,” she added. “We’re crossing our fingers.”

Last year, Annie produced four eggs, but broke the first one accidentally. Chicks later named Cade and Carson emerged from eggs two and three; the fourth chick didn’t hatch.

Peterson says it’s the perfect time for viewers to check the webcams, as “the laying process is good action. Once Annie starts incubating, she’ll mostly be hanging out for about 32 to 33 days,” until the chicks hatch.

Before the egg-laying began, Annie voted in the California primary election and looked at paint chips for the chicks’ nursery, thanks to social media posts by Schofield and Peterson, who use Instagram, Facebook and Twitter to educate and delight the falcons’ followers — who number in the thousands — with facts, short videos, close-up shots from long-focus lenses and occasional humorous photo-edited images of the birds.

This spring, Cal Falcons is offering new ways to engage with the birds and the scientists and wildlife experts who know them best. As of mid-February, Annie and Grinnell have one-stop shop website with access to their livestreams, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. There’s also a page to meet the scientists and learn their favorite falcon facts, a list of the partners in this scientific and educational falcon project, a falcon FAQ, a falcon glossary that defines terms like floaters, tiercels and eyrie and an “Ask a Scientist” form.

“It’s so nice to have falcon activity happening on a college campus, where we can aim for education, not just entertainment,” said Malec, who is affiliated with the East Bay Regional Parks District. “Most of our posts are fact-based and pretty interesting and professional.”

Another new addition this year is a permanent ethernet cable in the Campanile that will provide a stable connection for the webcams. Campus administrators responded favorably to a request last fall for funding, about $13,000, for the cable, said Carla Cicero, staff curator of birds at the campus’s Museum of Vertebrate Zoology and a liaison to the administration for the coalition of on- and off-campus experts who manage the falcon project.

A Cal Falcons crowdfunding effort in late 2018 raised over $14,500 for the first two webcams and a temporary cable for internet hook-up, which arrived in time for the 2019 nesting season. A third video camera was added last fall, with leftover funds, followed by the long-lasting cable.

That’s good news for those glued to the 24/7 falcon cams. The newest one, for example, allows views of Annie and Grinnell’s day-to-day lives from the tower’s southwest corner, where Grinnell recently brought Annie a red-winged blackbird, shorebirds and acorn woodpeckers to eat.

“We’ve seen a lot more prey exchanges between Annie and Grinnell, more courtship behavior and mating and more of where Grinnell is spending time roosting,” said Schofield.

As in previous years, the baby birds will be named at the beginning of May through a campus community naming competition.

Cal Falcons have launched an online T-shirt fundraiser to support Berkeley’s falcons and their care and keeping. The $20 blue and gold fan gear for kids and adults will sport two falcons swooping around the Campanile.

And, there’s one more update: Annie and Grinnell aren’t just expecting, they’re also expectant grandparents. Lawrencium, or “Larry,” a female born on the tower in 2018, has been living on Alcatraz Island, where researchers performing seabird studies saw her last April with a male falcon sitting nearby. Recently, rangers there spotted her setting up a territory.

Said Malec, “She seems to be doing all the right stuff.”

According to the zoo, the male peregrine is named Justice, hatched in 2012 at the Jackson County Tower Building. He originally paired with an unbanded female and hatched eight chicks.

Last year, the zoo said Justice took up with a female, KJ, who was hatched in 2016 in Wisconsin. According to the zoo, the new pair hasn't hatched any chicks yet, but there is an egg in the nest.

The DNR helped the zoo with the nest box design in the water tower.

Black rhinos are still in grave danger but the small increase – an annual rate of 2.5% over six years, has swollen the population from 4,845 in 2012 to an estimated 5,630 in 2018, giving hope that efforts put into saving the species are paying off.

The painstaking attempts to save the black rhino have included moving some individuals from established groups to new locations, increasing the species’ range and ensuring viable breeding populations, as well as protecting them through stronger law enforcement efforts. Numbers of all of the three subspecies of black rhino are now improving.

“The continued slow recovery is a testament to the immense efforts made in the countries and a powerful reminder that conservation works,” said Grethel Aguilar, acting director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which compiles the global red list of species under threat.

“[But] there is no room for complacency as poaching and illegal trade remain acute threats. It is essential that the ongoing anti-poaching measures and intensive, proactive population management continue, with support from national and international actors.”

The outlook for the other African rhino species is still troubled, according to the update to the red list published on Thursday.

White rhinos are more numerous in Africa but categorised by the IUCN as near-threatened. The outlook for them has worsened in recent years, driven by high levels of poaching in South Africa’s Kruger national park. White rhinos have larger horns than their black counterparts, making them more attractive to poachers, and they are easier to find as they prefer more open habitats.

Although white rhino numbers grew between 2007 and 2012, the numbers of the southern white rhino subspecies fell by 15% during that period, from an estimated 21,300 to 18,000, cancelling out previous growth.

Poaching levels appear to have declined again in the last few years, down from a peak in 2015 when an average of 3.7 rhinos were killed every day. Estimates for 2019 suggest poaching has declined further, owing to governments taking stronger measures against the organised crime gangs behind poaching.

“With the involvement of transnational organised crime in poaching, rhino crimes are not just wildlife crimes,” said Richard Emslie, a coordinator for African rhinos at IUCN. “If the encouraging declines in poaching can continue, this should positively impact rhino numbers. Continued expenditure and efforts will be necessary to maintain this trend.”

The impacts of the coronavirus crisis are also worrying experts, as the halt to tourism will reduce resources for conservation. “The impact of Covid-19 on global tourism is likely to have significant negative impacts on private commercial wildlife operations and state national parks and game reserves that conserve rhino,” said Emslie. “Those in the field paying for all the conservation work on the ground may need more financial support so that they can maintain current efforts despite the virus.”

The costs of keeping rhinos safe have risen greatly in the last decade, however, and live sale prices have fallen, reducing incentives for private landowners and communities to keep rhinos. About half of white rhinos and nearly 40% of black rhinos are on private land or land managed by communities. If the rhinos are viewed as a cost, that will further hamper efforts to protect them.

Thursday’s update to the red list showed tha more than 31,000 species around the world are threatened with extinction. The red list is likely to be updated at least three more times this year."~[]

Scientists and keepers had been closely monitoring Mei Xiang’s behavior and hormones since she began displaying behavioral changes March 12, indicating she was entering her breeding season. Hormone analyses determined Mei Xiang’s urinary estrogen concentrations also began to increase on the 12th, meaning she was within a week or so of ovulating and able to become pregnant. Female giant pandas are only in estrus, or able to become pregnant, for 24 to 72 hours each year.

Since the window when a giant panda can conceive a cub is so short, the Zoo’s panda team performed an artificial insemination on Mei Xiang. They artificially inseminated her using frozen semen from Tian Tian (t-YEN t-YEN) for the procedure.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” said Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute. “Our team carefully planned this procedure with the safety of staff and Mei Xiang as the number one priority, taking extra precautions due to COVID-19.”

During the past week, Mei Xiang became increasingly restless, wandering her yard, scent-marking, vocalizing and playing in water—all behaviors that increase in intensity before she reaches peak estrus. Tian Tian immediately noticed the hormonal changes in Mei Xiang and began displaying behaviors toward her indicating he was ready to breed. He vocalized to her and constantly tried to keep her in his sight for the past week. During the past few days, he spent much of his time at the “howdy window” that separates their yards. Mei Xiang did not respond positively to any of Tian Tian’s vocalizations until yesterday.

As Mei Xiang exhibited estrus behaviors, the Zoo received approval for its breeding plans from the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which monitors giant panda research programs in the United States. Mei Xiang is 21 and near the end of her reproductive life cycle, but there are pandas who have had cubs when they were older than she is now. Based on data from scientists in China and other zoos with pandas, females can breed into their early 20s.

As a public health precaution due to COVID-19, the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is temporarily closed to the public. Special precautions implemented to minimize person to person contact ahead of Mei Xiang’s artificial insemination included delivering medical supplies and setting up equipment in advance, as well as, limiting the number of staff present during the insemination event. Per usual procedures, the Zoo’s expert team of panda keepers closely watched Mei Xiang’s behavior, which is the best indicator, in addition to hormone analysis, that she has reached peak ovulation. These behaviors include an increase in positive vocalizations like bleats and chirps and walking backward with her tail up. Historically this behavior has tracked with peak estrogen and progesterone rise. Due to the successful banking of semen from Tian Tian over the past several years as part of the Smithsonian’s cryopreservation initiative, the team used frozen semen instead of fresh to reduce overall staff contact time and work load in consideration of the needs of staff and the other animals in the collection.

The Zoo’s webcams, including the giant panda webcam, remain online, but volunteers are not operating them, so animals may not be visible at all times.

The panda team will not know if the artificial insemination was successful for several months. Giant panda pregnancies and pseudopregnancies generally last between three to six months. Veterinarians will conduct ultrasounds to track changes in Mei Xiang’s reproductive tract and determine if she is pregnant during the next several months. Scientists will also monitor her hormones to determine when she is near the end of a pseudopregnancy or pregnancy. There is no way to determine if a female is pregnant by hormone analysis and behavior alone. Mei Xiang’s hormones and behavior will mimic a pregnancy even if she is experiencing a pseudopregnancy. The only definitive way to determine if she is pregnant before giving birth is to see a developing fetus on an ultrasound.

Giant pandas are listed as “vulnerable” in the wild by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. There are an estimated 1,800 in the wild. The Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute is a leader in giant panda conservation. Ever since these charismatic bears arrived at the Zoo in 1972, animal care staff and scientists have studied giant panda biology, behavior, breeding, reproduction and disease. These experts are also leading ecology studies in giant pandas’ native habitat. The Zoo’s giant panda team works closely with colleagues in China to advance conservation efforts around the world. Chinese scientists are working to reintroduce giant pandas to the wild.

The Zoo’s giant Panda reproduction research collaboration contract with the China Wildlife Conservation Association expires Dec. 7. The Zoo is in the process of renewing this agreement.

The Zoo will continue to provide updates on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter using #PandaStory and through the Giant Panda e-newsletter."~[]

The operation was conducted by a team of reproductive scientists, veterinarians and panda keepers at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, after they got approval from the China Wildlife Conservation Association and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

As of March 12, Mei Xiang started to show behavioral changes — becoming extremely restless, wandering her yard, scent-marking, vocalizing and playing in water –, which indicated that she was entering her breeding season. Scientists and keepers have been monitoring her closely since that date.

They also determined that urinary estrogen concentrations began to increase on the same day, a sign she was about to ovulate.

Panda ???? pregnancies & pseudopregnancies last between 3-6 months. #PandaStory #GiantPanda https://t.co/WiQ4n8pc5G — National Zoo (@NationalZoo) March 23, 2020

Female giant pandas are only able to become pregnant for 24 to 72 hours each year after entering this phase, according to the Zoo’s statement, which is the reason why the team had to perform the insemination immediately. Even though Mei Xiang is 21, it is known that females can breed into their early 20s.

For the operation, the team used frozen semen from Tian Tian, who actually noticed the hormonal changes in Mei Xiang and tried to get her attention, showing he was also ready to breed. Mei Xiang, on the other hand, did not respond to his vocalizations until Saturday.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars director of the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, was quoted as saying in the statement.

“Our team carefully planned this procedure with the safety of staff and Mei Xiang as the number one priority, taking extra precautions due to COVID-19.”

All Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo closed their doors to the public as of March 14 as a public health precaution due to the coronavirus outbreak."~[]

New updates are being added at the bottom…..

Original story (from Feb 12) follows:

If you own a Huawei Mate 20 Pro or a Mate 30 Pro then, there are new updates available for download. Notably, the EMUI 10 (Android 10) update for the Mate 20 Pro is now live for Three carrier users in the UK.

Moreover, the Huawei Mate 30 Pro is also being served with the Android 10 based EMUI 10 update. Taking about the update for the Huawei Mate 30 Pro, it arrives with the version number V10.0.0.191.

The update weighs in around 605 MB and brings some tweaks for the network, games, camera and touchscreen issues for the device.

However, as per a comment, users of the Huawei Mate 30 Pro in the US are getting the update with a version number ‘193’. But it seems like a typing error.

Coming to the update pushed for the Three carrier network users in the UK of the Huawei Mate 20 Pro, it arrives with the version number V10.0.0.180 and weighs in a chunky 4.52 GB in size. So, it is advised to use a stable internet or WiFi connection to download the update.

This new update brings in all the new features of the EMUI 10 for the Mate 20 Pro along with the goodies of Android 10. Previously we reported that the EMUI 10 updates are resumed for the Mate 20 Pro via the HiCare app.

We also came up with a report that the Huawei Mate 20 Pro EMUI 10 (Android 10) update on EE (UK) might roll out in April 2020. However, users of the UK carrier O2 reportedly started receiving the Android 10 update just a couple of days before.

Keep in mind the OTA updates for both Huawei Mate 20 Pro and 30 Pro is being pushed via OTA and will take some time in hitting all the units. If the OTA hasn’t hit your unit, check manually by going to Settings > System > Software Update > Check for Updates.

In the meantime, do check out our dedicated Huawei section to read similar stories surrounding Huawei smartphones and other devices.

Update 1 (Feb 24)

The update is now live for Huawei Mate 20 Pro devices on Vodafone network too.

Update 2 (Feb 29)

The update is now live for the Huawei Mate 20 Pro users on Orange carrier network in Romania.

Update 3 (March 23)

Users in Japan are receiving the updates on the Mate 20 Pro.

In India, the animal is found in three states only: West Bengal (Darjeeling district only), Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh. But, according to scientists, due to habitat fragmentation and rapid land use changes, the red panda populations exist in a series of local, small disconnected populations in India.

While red panda related crimes are at a relatively low level in India compared to Nepal, experts advise threat assessment, population estimations, boosting community conservation initiatives, building on red panda crime database and creating DNA databases at regional levels.

Indian scientists are building a DNA database for red panda populations in the country, even as a report warns of “serious threats” to the bushy-tailed and chestnut-furred animals. The main threats are from habitat degradation, amid “low levels” of crime related to the species in India.

According to Zoological Survey of India scientist Mukesh Thakur, the reference DNA database for existing populations of red pandas will aid conservation efforts and come in handy to combat illegal wildlife trade by helping law enforcement officials assign the seizure (of illegal wildlife trade derivatives) to the source of origin, which would aid prosecution.

Thakur has also acknowledged and accepted the recent genetic evidence that red pandas are actually two separate species – Chinese (Ailurus styani) and Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens).

The two species are distributed in the eastern and north-eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests and the eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests, which geographically fall in China, India, Nepal, Bhutan, and northern Myanmar.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature categorises red panda as endangered because its population has “plausibly declined by 50 percent over the last three generations (estimated at 18 years) and this decline is projected to continue, and probably intensify, in the next three generations.”

Experts estimate that around 14,500–15,000 individual red pandas remain worldwide. The main reasons for the population decline are habitat loss and degradation in almost all the range countries.

In India, the animal is distributed in three states only: West Bengal (Darjeeling district only), Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, Thakur said, noting there is no recent report of red panda presence from the Meghalaya Plateau. The animal is protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 in India, which means it is accorded the same protection as tigers.

Adding to conservation efforts, Thakur is leading the study of fine-scale landscape genetics of red panda covering the eastern Himalayas and building a reference DNA database to help in the identification of confiscated cases, under an ongoing five-year project of the government of India’s Department of Science and Technology INSPIRE Faculty scheme.

“We are collecting poop of red pandas from all across the distribution in the eastern Himalayas to build a DNA database and we have already done it from the wild populations in Kangchenjunga landscape, covering North Bengal and Sikkim. We collected 250 plus faecal samples and genetically identified 24 unique individuals in the landscape in India,” Thakur of Centre for DNA Taxonomy and coordinator – Centre for Forensic Sciences, Zoological Survey of India, told Mongabay-India.

“Now in the second phase, we are focussing on red panda populations in Arunachal Pradesh. So far about 50 faecal samples have been collected from various parts of Arunachal Pradesh and my students, Hiren and Supriyo are still in the field for sample collection and conducting surveys. I hope by next year we will have the complete picture of red panda populations in India,” he said.

The 25,085 square km Kangchenjunga landscape (KL), encompassing India, Nepal and Bhutan, ranges in elevation from 40 metres to 8,586 metres and is home to more than seven million people, while hosting more than 4,500 species of plants and at least 169 mammal and 618 bird species.

The landscape supports the transboundary population of red pandas in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. To learn more about how populations are faring in the India part of the landscape, the scientists undertook distribution modelling and fine-scale landscape genetics. They discovered that due to habitat fragmentation and rapid changes in the land use patterns, the red panda populations exist in a series of localised, small, imperfectly connected populations.

“Our investigations suggest that about 1309.54 square km area is suitable for red pandas in the Indian part of the Kangchenjunga landscape, of which 62.21 percent area falls under the protected area network,” Thakur said, adding that there is no India-level exact estimate of the red panda populations.

The National Studbook on the red panda (April 2018) states that the current captive population of red pandas in India includes 24 individuals in three zoos. The population retains a limited amount of genetic diversity and includes closely related individuals."~[]

The zoo announced Monday that they artificially inseminated 21-year-old giant panda Mei Xiang after she displayed signs that she was ready to breed.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,” Steven Monfort of the zoo said in a statement.

Panda Watch: Mei Xiang’s Hormones Rise

“Our team carefully planned this procedure with the safety of staff and Mei Xiang as the number one priority, taking extra precautions due to COVID-19,"" he added.

Reproductive scientists, veterinarians and panda keepers artificially inseminated Mei Xiang with frozen semen from Tian Tian, her male panda companion.

The panda couple’s last cub, Bei Bei, moved to China in November. The empty-nesters may be hoping for a new cub to keep them company.

We won’t know if the procedure was successful for a few months, since panda pregnancies last between three to six months, according to the National Zoo.

While you wait, you can keep up with Mei Xiang and Tian Tian even during the zoo’s closure by watching the Giant Panda Cam livestream here."~[]

Some exciting news for animal lovers: Giant panda Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated over the weekend at the Smithsonian National Zoo! The procedure was performed on Sunday, March 22, after the beloved panda began exhibiting behaviors common with ovulation. Considering female pandas only conceive during a single 24-72 hour period during the year, this marks a huge moment for panda conservation, as reflected in the successful breeding program between China and the United States.

“This is another milestone in our long-standing and successful mission-critical 47-year giant panda conservation program and collaboration with Chinese colleagues to study, care for, and help save the giant panda and its native habitat,"" said Steven Monfort, John and Adrienne Mars Director, Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, said in an official press release.

Having occurred amidst the coronavirus pandemic, zoo staff took necessary measures in protecting themselves and the people around them during the procedure. They also used frozen semen from Tian Tian, which the zoo has collected through the years.

Mei Xiang started displaying signs signaling she was ready to breed on March 12, with the giant panda marking her scent throughout the habitat and playing with her water. She also responded to courtship behaviors by the zoo's panda patriarch, Tian Tian. The male giant panda also fathered Bao Bao and Bei Bei, who have both been transferred to China (Bei Bei left in 2019). Panda breeding season typically begins in March and runs until May, so it seems Mei Xiang is right on schedule!

So when will we know she's pregnant? Female pandas can experience a ""pseudopregnancy,"" which means they can display similar behaviors of pregnancy without actually being pregnant. Both pregnancies and pseudopregnancies last between 3-6 months, so experts won't know her status until they conduct an ultrasound. In the meantime, we'll be waiting by the Panda Cam!

While the Oklahoma City Zoo is closed due to the unprecedented coronavirus emergency public health emergency, it has launched an exclusive real-time look at the Oklahoma City Zoo’s red panda family with the zoo’s new red panda cam online at www.okczoo.org/redpandacam .

Viewers an experience a virtual visit to the OKC Zoo’s red panda habitat at Sanctuary Asia from the ease of their smartphone, computer or tablet to watch Thomas, 6, and Leela, 5, plus their offspring Khyana and Ravi, 9 months, play, eat and engage with their caretakers. Youngsters Khyana and Ravi are always on the move climbing and exploring their habitat, providing hours of viewing enjoyment.

In October, Khyana underwent an amputation of her hind, left leg, due to a congenital deformity. She is thriving and continues to do everything her four-legged brother, Ravi, can do.

Known for being great climbers, red pandas spend most of their lives in trees, even sleeping in branches. Red pandas grow to be about the size of a typical house cat. Their bushy, ringed tails add about 18 inches to their length and serve as a type of blanket keeping them warm in cold mountain climates.

Though previously classified as a relative of the giant panda, and also of the raccoon, with which it shares a ringed tail, red pandas are currently considered members of their own unique taxonomic family—the Ailuridae. The red panda is listed as an endangered species. Only an estimated 10,000 remain in the wild, and their habitats in remote areas of the Himalayan Mountains, from Nepal to central China, are being threatened by deforestation, agriculture, cattle grazing and competition for resources. The OKC Zoo participates in the Red Panda Species Survival Plan, developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums as a cooperative effort among AZA-accredited zoos throughout North America to help promote genetic diversity through species management."~[]

Two eggs were recently viewed in the nest atop Indiana Michigan Power Center via I&M’s Falcon Cam at www.IndianaMichiganPower.com/FalconCam

The identity of the parents has yet to be confirmed by a reading of the ID bands on their legs, but they are presumed to be Jamie (male) and Moxie (female). If so, the eggs bring to at least 25 the number Jamie and Moxie have laid since taking up residence on the downtown landmark in 2013.

I&M’s Falcon Cam is a popular attraction for birders, falcon fans and ornithology aficionados. In the busiest months when the falcon chicks are active, I&M records more than 10,000 page views. The Falcon Cam is the result of a partnership between Indiana Michigan Power, Soarin’ Hawk Avian Rescue and the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

Indiana Michigan Power Center (previously known as One Summit Square) has been an important element in the restoration of peregrine falcons that began nearly 30 years ago by the Indiana DNR. A nesting box built in 1996 has been the place nearly 60 falcon chicks have hatched, making it one of the more productive sites in the Midwest for the falcon restoration.

The falcon eggs generally hatch about a month after eggs are laid, and the young birds take their first flights at about six weeks of age.

Once the falcons reach an appropriate age, I&M will work with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to name and band each falcon."~[]

West African lions show no statistically significant preference between the parks and trophy-hunting areas, research finds.

West African lions are a critically endangered subpopulation, with an estimated 400 remaining and strong evidence of ongoing declines.

About 90% of these lions live in West Africa’s largest protected area complex, the W-Arly-Pendjari. The WAP Complex includes five national parks and 14 hunting concessions across roughly 10,200 square miles in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Benin.

Given that wildlife protection is one of the main purposes of a national park, you might expect West African lions to favor life inside park boundaries, rather than within the privately managed hunting concessions that surround the parks. After all, lions tend to shun people, and human pressures are higher in hunting areas than in the parks.

But the new camera survey of West African lions—believed to be the largest wildlife camera survey ever undertaken in West Africa and the first carried out within WAP Complex national parks and hunting concessions—found otherwise.

The findings, published in the Journal of Applied Ecology, have implications for conservation management of the remaining West African lions.

So why are the lions not avoiding people?

“Our results suggest habitat quality in national parks is inadequate, leading to a lack of preference in lions despite lower human pressures,” says doctoral student Kirby Mills of the University of Michigan’s Applied Wildlife Ecology (AWE) Lab, lead author of the study.

The researchers suspect that the lure of plentiful water, high-quality habitat, and abundant prey on hunting properties outweigh the lions’ natural avoidance of humans. Revenues from trophy hunting pay for enhanced infrastructure such as irrigation systems and solar-powered pumps at watering holes, as well as added patrol staff.

At the same time, under-resourced national parks struggle to deal with degraded wildlife habitat, poachers, inadequate staffing, and displacement of wildlife by livestock, which are permitted within the parks.

“We recommend prioritizing the reduction of habitat degradation in the parks and increasing water availability to increase suitable habitat for lions and their prey,” says Mills, who conducted the study for her master’s thesis at the University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability. “But at the same time, we recognize that management interventions at a large scale require economic resources unavailable to park managers in WAP, an incongruity prolific throughout the range of African lions.”

West African lions on camera

In the study, 238 motion-activated digital cameras were deployed across 5,000 square miles in three WAP Complex national parks and 11 of the hunting concessions. The fieldwork took place from February through June in 2016, 2017, and 2018.

The researchers captured some 1.7 million images during that time, but West African lions triggered the shutter just 96 times, reflecting the critically endangered feline’s scarcity. The cameras were programmed to rapid-fire three to five frames when triggered, so the total number of lion images is 360.

The camera data were used in two types of mathematical models—occupancy models and structural equation models. The occupancy models allowed the researchers to calculate the probability that an animal used a given space, while the SEM models enabled them to disentangle the relative effects of environmental, ecological, and anthropogenic factors influencing space use by West African lions.

The researchers found that lion occupancy was largely driven by prey availability, which in turn was shaped by ecological and environmental variables—such as water availability and habitat diversity—that scored higher in hunting concessions than in national parks.

Contrary to the researchers’ expectations, the WAP Complex lions showed no discernable preference between national parks and hunting zones. The study provides the first estimate of West African lion occupancy using camera-trap data.

“We hypothesize that ecological cues indicating high-quality habitat, such as plentiful water and available prey, are mitigating the expected avoidance response to the increased human pressures and competitor activity in hunting concessions,” says senior author Nyeema Harris, an assistant professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the AWE Lab. Harris designed the project and led the fieldwork with a team that included government employees and students from Burkina Faso and Niger.

“Because the lions rely heavily on prey, managers may be able to manipulate the distribution of prey within WAP to directly influence spatial distributions of lions and indirectly reduce human-lion conflict.

Trophy hunting

Trophy hunting is permitted in all of the WAP Complex concessions but is illegal in the five national parks and in Niger’s Tamou game reserve, which is part of the protected area complex. The lions are known to feed on several species of antelope, as well as savanna buffalos and warthogs. Predators that compete with the lions for food include spotted hyenas and leopards.

West African lions are categorized as critically endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species. In its 2015 assessment, the IUCN states that the West African lion subpopulation is estimated at just above 400 animals, with fewer than 250 mature individuals.

West African lions are smaller than, and genetically distinct from, other African lions. They form smaller prides, and the males have little to no mane.

“This population continues to decline,” the IUCN assessment states. “Further deterioration of the last protected areas harboring lions in West Africa will likely lead to the local extinction of the species.”

Financial support for the project came from the University of Michigan’s African Studies Center-STEM Initiative, its Office of Research, the German Society of Mammalian Biology, and the Detroit Zoological Society.

4/2/2020 – Amid the Coronavirus crisis, chess players have turned to online tournaments to practice, compete and keep their spirits high. In this context, ChessBase India organized a five-event series to take place every Saturday since the 21st of March. Two tourneys have already been played.

Three-minute games

The ChessBase India online series is a five-tournament event that takes place every Saturday at 20:00 IST (15:30 CET). Each tourney is a nine-round Swiss open with a time control of 3 minutes per game, without increment. Entry is free for all players, however an active ChessBase Premium subscription is mandatory to participate.

The first two contests had 191 and 225 participants, with 43 and 55 titled players respectively. Just to get a gist of how strong the events have been, the second tournament of the series included eight 2600+ players. Although most of the top seeds were Indian representatives, the top two rated participants at the inaugural event were GM Gadir Guseinov from Azerbaijan and GM Zaven Andriasian from Armenia.

With most — if not all — over-the-board official action either postponed or cancelled, this is a chance for strong players to prove their prowess against online-blitz specialists. Some of these experts online grinders left their mark in the second tournament, as three grandmasters did not even make the top-50 in the final crosstable.

The third competition will take place on April 4th, with Adhiban Baskaran (India), Rinat Jumabayev (Kazakhstan), Aravindh Chithambaram (India), Alan Pichot (Argentina) and Gukesh D (India) among the top participants.

First Saturday: ""Chessworld"" outscores the field

Playing online means you need to create a username. While some choose to use their names or something deriving from their names, others choose a different approach. The winner of the inaugural event, 14-year-old Praggnanandhaa, plays under the pseudonym ""Chessworld1"", and with it got the first place on March 21st after scoring 8 out 9 points.

Three players tied on a 7½ score, finishing in the following order according to tiebreak criteria: Diptayan Ghosh (Diptayan), S Rohit Krishna (Srohitkrishna) and Aryonak Ghosh (STRANGE).

GM Elshan Moradiabadi both participated (he finished on 7 out of 9) and wrote a report for ChessBase India. He found Pragg's key to success was his consistency, elaborating:

Praggnanandhaa’s level and class in over the board chess is well-established. However, he has not had same online presence in the past. This may be his first of many online tournament victories. His key to success was his consistent play, good time management, and practical decisions.

Second Saturday: ""Indian-Lion"" undefeated

Improve your chess with Tania Sachdev On this DVD, well-known Indian WGM Tania Sachdev shows you how to evaluate certain positions and then find the right concepts and plans on the basis of her own games.

Much has been said about the incredible ascent of Indian players in the last years. The winner of the second tournament of the series is yet another example of this sudden surge of strong players. Arjun Erigaisi (Indian-Lion) got his grandmaster title at the age of 14 years, 11 months and 13 days, and currently has an official rating of 2559. On March 28th, he finished atop the standings table on 8 out of 9, leaving four players a half point behind.

Some of the top scorers from the previous weekend also excelled in the second event. Second to fifth places went to those who ended up on a 7½ score: Diptayan Ghosh (Diptayan), Aryonak Ghosh (STRANGE), Zaven Andriasian (zaven Grozny) and Praggnanandhaa (Chessworld1).

The ""Indian-Lion"" showed nerves of steel to get his tournament victory, getting some extra half points by maintaining an acceptable level of precision with seconds on the clock. After getting seven wins in a row, he drew Diptayan and Andriasian to secure first place.

conversation every weekend sign weekly newsletter~"Editor’s note: Netflix’s new docuseries “Tiger King” takes viewers into the strange world of big cat collectors. Featuring eccentric characters with names like Joe Exotic and Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, the series touches on polygamy, addiction and personality cults, while exploring a mysterious disappearance and a murder-for-hire.

To Allison Skidmore, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies wildlife trafficking, the documentary didn’t bring enough attention to the scourge of captive big cats.

A former park ranger, Skidmore first started studying the issue in the U.S. after the infamous death of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe in 2015. She was shocked to learn about how little oversight there was stateside. We asked her about the legality, incentives and ease of buying and selling tigers.

1. How many captive tigers are in the US?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer. The vast majority of captive tigers are crossbred hybrids, so they aren’t identified as members of one of the six tiger subspecies – the Bengal tiger, Amur tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger and Malayan tiger. Instead, they’re classified as “generic.”

Less than 5% – or fewer than 350 – of tigers in captivity are managed through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a nonprofit organization that serves as an accrediting body in the U.S. They ensure accredited facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by law.

All the rest are privately owned tigers, meaning they don’t belong to one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ 236 sponsored institutions. These are considered generic and fall outside of federal oversight.

There’s no legal requirement to register these generic tigers, nor a comprehensive national database to track and monitor them. The best educated guess puts the number of tigers at around 10,000 in the U.S. Estimates put the global captive tiger population as high as 25,000.

In comparison, there are fewer than 4,000 tigers in the wild – down from 100,000 a century ago.

2. How do tigers change hands?

The Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna prevent the importation of tigers from the wild. So all tigers in the U.S. are born in captivity, with the rare exception of an orphaned wild cub that may end up in a zoo.

Only purebred tigers that are one of the six definitive subspecies are accounted for; these are the tigers you see in places like the Smithsonian National Zoo and generally belong to the Species Survival Plan, a captive breeding program designed to regulate the exchange of specific endangered species between member zoos in order to maintain genetic diversity.

All other tigers are found in zoos, sanctuaries, carnivals, wildlife parks, exhibits and private homes that aren’t sanctioned by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They can change hands in any number of ways, from online marketplaces to exotic animal auctions. They can be bought for as little as US$800 to $2,000 for a cub and $200 to $500 for an adult, which is less expensive than many purebred dog puppies.

3. Can I legally buy a tiger?

The U.S. is plagued with complicated and vague laws concerning tiger ownership.

However, there are no federal statutes or regulations that expressly forbid private ownership of tigers. State and local jurisdictions have been given this authority, and some do pass bans or require permits. Thirty-two states have bans or partial bans, and 14 states allow ownership with a simple license or permit. Four states – Alabama, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Nevada – have no form of oversight or regulation at all.

An overarching, cohesive framework of regulations is missing, and even in states that ban private ownership, there are loopholes. For example, in all but three states, owners can apply for what’s called a “federal exhibitor license,” which is remarkably cheap and easy to obtain and circumvents any stricter state or local laws in place.

You now need a permit to transport tigers across state lines, but there’s still no permit required for intra-state travel.

4. What’s in it for the owners?

Some see it as a business venture, while others claim they care about conservation. I consider the latter reason insincere.

Many facilities promote themselves as wildlife refuges or sanctuaries. These places frame their breeding and exhibition practices as stewardship, as if they’re contributing to an endangered animal’s survival. The reality is that no captive tiger has ever been released into the wild, so it’s not like these facilities can augment wild populations. A true sanctuary or refuge should have a strict no breeding or handling policy, and should have education programs dedicated to promoting conservation.

Allison Skidmore , Author provided

Ultimately, tigers are big money makers, especially tiger cubs. The Animal Welfare Act allows cub petting from eight to 12 weeks of age. People pay $100 to $700 to pet, bottle-feed, swim with or take a photo with a cub.

None of these profits go toward the conservation of wild tigers, and this small window of opportunity for direct public contact means that exhibitors must continually breed tigers to maintain a constant supply of cubs.

The value of cubs declines significantly after 12 weeks. Where do all these surplus tigers go? Unfortunately, due to a lack of regulatory oversight, it’s hard to know.

Since many states don’t account for their live tigers, there’s also no oversight regarding the reporting and disposal of dead tigers. Wildlife criminologists fear that these tigers can easily end up in the black market where their parts can cumulatively be worth up to $70,000. There’s evidence of U.S. captive tigers tied to the domestic black market trade: In 2003, an owner of a tiger “rescue” facility was found to have 90 dead tigers in freezers on his property. And in 2001, an undercover investigation led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ended up leading to the prosecutions of 16 people for buying, selling and slaughtering 19 tigers.

5. What role does social media play?

Posing with tigers on social media platforms like Instagram and on dating apps has become a huge problem. Not only can it create a health and safety risk for both the human and tiger, but it also fosters a false narrative.

If you see thousands of photos of people with captive tigers, it masks the true problem of endangered tigers in the wild. Some might wonder whether tigers are really so endangered if they’re so easy to pose with.

The reality of the wild tiger’s plight has become masked behind the pomp and pageantry of social media. This marginalizes meaningful ideas about conservation and the true status of tigers as one of the most endangered big cats.

cheetah to India in an effort to reintroduce the species in the country. The Asiatic cheetah, which once roamed India’s vast forests and grasslands, was declared extinct here in 1952, after decades of human intervention, hunting and habitat degradation. The IUCN Red List classifies the species as critically endangered globally.

Kim Young-Overton.

Kim Young-Overton, KAZA programme director for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization, believes that if any programme were to responsibly and successfully reintroduce the Asiatic, not African, cheetah, “it would be remarkable for this cheetah subspecies"". KAZA stands for the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area in southern Africa, which hosts roughly 20% of the global cheetah population.

The Asiatic cheetah is now found only in Iran, so, says Young-Overton, this would create a second population, thereby “greatly decreasing the probability of extinction of the subspecies"". Currently, she adds, Panthera’s on-the-ground cheetah conservation efforts focus on priority landscapes in Africa.

In an email interview, she explains why India’s plan requires considerable ecological, political, social and financial planning. Edited excerpts:

How complicated is it to introduce a big cat species to a completely new region? Also, how ethical is it?

The proposal to reintroduce the cheetah to India is an exciting opportunity to reinstate an important component of India’s savanna and woodland biodiversity. The Asiatic cheetah was an iconic cheetah subspecies that is now critically endangered and only occurs in a single population of less than 50 individuals in Iran. Reintroduction of this subspecies would not only be ecologically valuable for India’s biodiversity but also be a fundamental gain for the long-term persistence of this critically endangered subspecies.

However, to maximize the opportunity to create a viable and self-sustaining population and return the greatest conservation gains, a rigorous set of assessments— ecological, social, socioeconomic, epidemiological (veterinary and disease), animal welfare, financial and political impact, and feasibility of success—must be made.

For example, in the case of predators, human-wildlife conflict challenges at the receiving site need to be addressed before release. Financial resources to manage and protect the new species must be ensured. Also, source site population dynamics need to be considered to ensure that removing the required number of individuals to create a new breeding population doesn’t impact the viability of the original population.

To ensure impacts, costs and benefits are adequately addressed and that the translocation of the animals is ethical and warranted, several decision-making frameworks have been developed by authorities and organizations.

In the case of the proposal at hand, the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus) is a subspecies that naturally occurred in India. If the Asiatic cheetah is the source population and all prerequisites are met, the reintroduction would be an ecologically exciting prospect. However, if another subspecies of cheetah is used (Acinonyx jubatus jubatus from Namibia, as currently planned in India), then the proposal would be less desirable. It would neither contribute to the maintenance of genetic diversity nor contribute to the conservation of the Asiatic subspecies.

This is important given that the genetic diversity of cheetah is low relative to other species. Maintaining genetic diversity ensures species resilience in times of disease and change. The introduction of the southern African subspecies instead of the return of the Asiatic cheetah to India may squander or even compromise this opportunity.

Furthermore, India’s desire to restore grasslands and savannas using the cheetah as a flagship (species) would be better served by the Asiatic cheetah. The Indian people could rightly be very proud to have their Asiatic cheetah back. This would also have potential tourism value as it may be the only place that tourists can have access to the subspecies (apart from Iran). In my opinion, India would have less reason to herald the reintroduction of the cheetah to India as opposed to the return of the Asiatic cheetah.

What are some of the prerequisites for such a translocation plan?

The most fundamental requirement is that the factors that drove the species to extinction should be corrected, so that the species can be expected to thrive in the area.

Cheetahs require a suitably large habitat to maintain a viable population, sufficient numbers of suitable prey, and low levels of killing of cheetah by humans and other animals. Achieving these conditions requires ecological, social and political preparation, careful site selection and resources to protect the translocated animals and monitor their movement. In terms of site preparation, there must be considerable community engagement and public education about the value of the species to the system, and to the people. People need to understand why the animals should not be killed when they come into human contact. Landscape plans are needed to ensure long-term habitat protection from development and other human disturbance. In India, this may also include a habitat conservation and management plan, including policy specifically for savanna and woodland habitats as these systems are under pressure there.

How adaptable is the African cheetah? Are there any successful examples of such a translocation plan for big cat species?

Cheetahs are fairly adaptable and present across varied climate and habitats in their extant range. However, they require specialized prey and do not tolerate landscapes that have medium to high human populations.

In terms of successful translocations, they may struggle to establish where there are high numbers of other predators, and in open unfenced landscapes. Even though cheetahs have been successfully reintroduced into small fenced reserves in South Africa and elsewhere, to our knowledge there have been no successful reintroductions to unfenced wild landscapes. Indeed, even some translocations of the southern Africa subspecies to other open protected areas even within southern Africa have failed, e.g. to the Lower Zambezi National Park.

The drawback for the translocation of the southern African subspecies to India is not related to its ability to adapt but, rather, the ecological and ethical considerations, as well as the lost opportunity to reintroduce the Asiatic subspecies.

Conservationists say India should concentrate on reviving native species on the brink of extinction, like the Asiatic lion and Great Indian Bustard, rather than reintroducing a species that went extinct decades ago.

This argument has some merit but also assumes that the funds for the cheetah reintroduction could be used for other conservation efforts. Often, the drivers for a reintroduction are less about ecological outcome than the desire to have a charismatic species as a national identity or tourism drawcard. The reintroduction of the Asiatic cheetah into India could help bring this subspecies back from extinction and also assist with bringing funds to the site. As mentioned earlier, this may not be the case for the southern African subspecies from Namibia.

With climate change putting additional stress on habitats, is it wise to consider introduction at all?

Cheetahs have wide climatic tolerances but the impacts of climate change and increasing human populations are placing pressure on cheetah habitats. Introductions, reintroductions and translocations of cheetah among populations are conservation tools that have some merit in maintaining range and providing resilience in regional and global populations but on a case-by-case basis, with proper assessment. Conservation in situ and protection of existing populations is probably more effective. However, in the case of the Asiatic cheetah, it is essential to increase the persistence of the subspecies by extending its range beyond one population. This will require translocation.

An important planning step would be to model predicted impacts of climate change and associated changes in human activity on cheetah habitats in India.

What is the Asiatic cheetah’s conservation status in Iran? How different is it from the African subspecies?

The Asiatic cheetah is arguably the most distinct of the cheetah subspecies. It is lighter in weight, has a smaller head and shorter legs. It faces many threats, including persecution killing, habitat loss (prey depletion), targeted poaching for skins, body parts and live trade, and even road-kill.

Tiger numbers in India have improved over the last few years, almost close to 3,000. Do you think wildlife conservationists and government authorities can take encouragement from this as they attempt something similar for the cheetah?

India’s commitment to tigers bodes well for conserving cheetahs if introduced. However, unlike the tiger that lives in forested habitats, cheetahs need savanna grasslands and open woodlands. These habitats are some of the most threatened in India. Often classified as wastelands, some of the best habitats have been converted into plantations of exotic tree species (to either increase forest cover or for fuelwood security), mining or other land uses, including the Green India Mission (one of the eight Missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change) solar power projects. So, if the proposal is to go beyond an “experimental"" introduction (as stated in the court order) to bringing back an iconic species that fills an ecological niche, the plan must begin by designing and implementing a savanna grassland conservation and management policy.

Indian savanna grassland habitats have other iconic species like the Great Indian Bustard and wolf. Policies to conserve these habitats need to be formulated to save these species. If the cheetah can be the species that prompts this change, it will certainly be welcomed.

mail@floridanewsline.com

Born in November 2019, new jaguar cubs Rio and Diego were presented to the St. Augustine Wild Reserve from a jaguar conservation group. Deborah Warrick, founder and CEO of the St. Augustine Wild Reserve, said she

promised to use the two brothers for educational purposes, which is why she was allowed to take possession of these highly threatened cats. There are only about 15,000 jaguars left in the wild.

“Rio is our spotted jaguar, while Diego is our black jaguar, known as the melanistic color phase, which occurs due to a genetic mutation,” Warrick said. “Such a mutation causes the fur and skin to contain large amounts of dark pigments. Black jaguars prefer rainforests, since the dark foliage enables them to blend into the dark shadows of the forest.”

Jaguars are normally found in South America, and also range through Texas and Arizona. Their spots are called rosettes, and appear to be “spots within spots.” They are the largest cat in the Americas, and are the third largest cat in the world, just under the tiger and lion; they can weigh as much as 250 pounds.

Jaguars love to swim, much like tigers. They fish in rivers and also capture large crocodilians, biting deeply into their skulls, delivering a killing bite. (Other cats kill by biting the necks of their prey.) They even dunk their tails into water sources, luring fish. The name “jaguar” originates from the Native American word “yajuar,” which means “he who kills with one leap.”

Warrick shared the following coronavirus updates from the St. Augustine Wild Reserve:

Now more than ever, we can use the donation of supplies for our animals, including monetary donations. Our tour operation has diminished considerably in the wake of this novel virus that is sweeping not just our nation, but the world. To protect our staff and guests, we sanitize everything, including our guest chairs and our limo cart, used to ferry handicapped individuals around the animal compound on tours. We offer hand sanitizer to our guests upon arrival and departure, and will be offering masks, once our order is shipped to us.

This is an open-air compound and is always breezy, so we are less likely to contract a virus if we practice proper sanitation and social distancing. Guests are encouraged to stay at least six feet away from other guests. We hope that more visitors will book a tour with us through bookeo.com/tigertours. Our tours are appropriate for children and adults. If you cannot visit, consider helping through these rough times by sending a tax-deductible donation.

Staffed by a host of valuable volunteers, the St. Augustine Wild Reserve is always in need of new caging and animal supplies. Plans are to raise funds to construct an on-site veterinary clinic, and a barn for diet preparation. Contact the reserve at wildreserve@aol.com if you would like to volunteer, particularly if you have building/welding skills or fence working skills. The St Augustine Wild Reserve is a 501©3 tax exempt organization. Visit www.sawildreserve.org for more information.

The St. Augustine Wild Reserve offers tours on an appointment-only basis. Tours are on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 2 p.m. by appointment only. Call (904) 940-0664 for reservations or email WildReserve@aol.com. Visit bookeo.com/tigertours to book a tour online. Donations may be sent to 5190 Farm Creek Road, St. Augustine, FL 32092.

One show, in particular, seems to have caught the nation’s fascination — “Tiger King.” Unfortunately, there is so much more to the story than what this sad reality show reveals.

After watching the first few episodes, it didn’t take long to understand why so many people were fascinated by the story of Joe Exotic, Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage, and others like him. For me, it was a display of blatant animal cruelty, substandard conditions, improper care and the often unpleasant personality traits of individuals involved in the exploitation of animals — and the exploitation of people.

On the surface, one might think hanging around exotic big cats is a dream come true. But for the animal victims in these lucrative businesses, their lives are far from a dream. The profits come from people paying top dollar to have their picture taken with a cub. But, cubs grow up — so to keep turning a profit, more cubs must be produced.

According to the Performing Animal Welfare Sanctuary in California:

• Cub petting operations must constantly breed their females. This “speed breeding” physically depletes the mothers, and cubs are often born sickly or dead.

• Cubs are ripped from their mothers shortly after birth, traumatizing both mother and cubs. The cubs are then hand-raised, depriving them of immune-boosting antibodies found in their mother’s milk and leaving them vulnerable to disease, including some that can be transmitted to adults and children who handle them.

• Once they grow big enough to be used for photos ops, cubs are subjected to hours of rough handling, denied sleep and often abused.

• After about eight to 12 weeks, the cubs can no longer be used, as they are more dangerous for the public to handle. They may be sold to other roadside zoos or private individuals, where conditions may be as bad or even worse, retained to breed more cubs, or, as “Tiger King” suggests, killed.

For many of us in the world of animal law enforcement, dealing with the captive wildlife trade and all the issues that go along with it can’t end soon enough. For decades, we’ve been trying to educate people, encourage enforcement in jurisdictions with little to no regulations on exotic animal ownership, and working hard to combat the breeding and resulting surplus of tigers in pseudo-sanctuaries, backyards and private breeders.

Reputable animal sanctuaries like PAWS and Big Cat Rescue only accept animals confiscated by law enforcement or from owners who are trying to get rid of them. The sanctuaries prohibit petting, and in the case of Big Cat Rescue, will only take animals if the owners sign a contract declaring that they’ll never own, or even have a photo taken with, another big cat.

It’s easy to breed tigers for profit, but it it’s harder to care for them in ways that help them thrive. Two national groups that ensure good care standards for exotic animals are the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries. If you come across a facility or individual promoting exotic animals, check to see if they are a member of either of these organizations before giving them your business or donations.

And, H.R. 1380, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, will provide a national framework to prevent many of the cruelties portrayed in “Tiger King.” Tigers, along with other exotic animals, belong in the wild and in properly accredited zoos and sanctuaries, not in the hands of individuals who exploit them.

While it’s unfortunate Netflix didn’t use this opportunity to expose the level of cruelty and inhumane treatment of these animals, I am heartened to see this is as starting point for conversations about how we treat wild animals and how we can work to end their exploitation.

the G.W. Zoo) in Wynnewood, Oklahoma. He is serving a 22-year prison sentence for crimes including illegally transporting and selling tigers.

The over-the-top, oddball cast of characters in Netflix’s popular ""Tiger King"" series have one thing in common: They all claim to love tigers . They even insist that through the ownership and operation of zoos and petting events, they raise public awareness about tigers and so, in turn, are helping endangered species.

But those who work on the front lines of tiger conservation strongly disagree.

Experts told Live Science that the roadside and private zoos of ""Tiger King,"" all of which are unaccredited and unregulated, hold no value for tiger conservation. Rather, the zoos contribute nothing to the preservation of tiger populations in the wild; they breed captive animals that are prone to genetic defects and health issues; and they may even increase the threats to wild tigers from poachers.

""Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness"" debuted on Netflix on March 20, delivering an almost unbelievable seven-episode story of tiger ownership and public display alongside drug addiction, gun fetishizing, polygamy, vendettas, suicide and assassination-for-hire. In fact, the human drama in ""Tiger King"" is so outlandish that it upstages the tigers.

Well, almost.

Tigers (Panthera tigris), of which there are nine subspecies, once roamed forests and grasslands across Asia, from Turkey to Russia's eastern coast, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Only a century ago, there were approximately 100,000 tigers in the wild. Today, just 2,000 to 3,000 tigers exist in the wild: in Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Russia and Thailand, where they occupy less than 6% of their former range, the IUCN says.

But the idea that this rare cat can be helped by captive-breeding as many of them as possible is a misconception, said Dale Miquelle, coordinator of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) Tiger Program and director of the WCS Russia Program.

""The problem is not that tigers can't breed in the wild. They are perfectly capable if they are provided with the minimum needs for survival — sufficient space, sufficient prey and protection from poaching,"" Miquelle told Live Science in an email.

Regulated breeding by reputable zoos can produce captive populations that may be suitable for reintroducing into the wild in areas where tigers have already vanished. However, as long as human activities continue to drive tigers to extinction in their native habitats, breeding more tigers won't help the species unless those ongoing threats are addressed, Miquelle said.

Regulated breeding

An estimated 5,000 tigers live in zoos or private collections in the U.S. alone. But just 6% of those tigers inhabit facilities that are accredited members of organizations such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). Such zoos strictly monitor animal breeding, and have fundraising and public education programs that support tiger research and conservation, Leigh Henry, director of Wildlife Policy at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), told Live Science in an email.

About 230 zoological parks and aquariums are AZA-accredited; together, they care for more than 800,000 animals and support hundreds of projects worldwide to conserve vulnerable species and habitats, according to the organization's website .

AZA zoos participate in the Species Survival Plan (SSP), ""which strives to maintain captive populations that could be used for reintroduction should a species go extinct in the wild,"" said John Goodrich, chief scientist and director of the Tiger Program for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization. This guideline ensures that subspecies are separated, and that closely related tigers aren’t interbred — both criteria help to produce healthy, genetically diverse animals that could survive in the wild.

""This SSP strictly controls the captive breeding of species like tigers to ensure their genetic integrity and to ensure that the scale of breeding does not exceed that needed to meet the conservation goal,"" Goodrich told Live Science in an email. ""This stands in stark contrast to petting zoos like those featured in 'Tiger King.'"" (One zoo in the show is an exception: Big Cat Rescue, a nonprofit sanctuary in Tampa, Florida, which houses rescued animals and does not breed tigers or offer cubs for petting.)

Some of the ""Tiger King"" cats are not even true tigers, but rather ""human-created oddities"" — hybrids such as ""ligers,"" the offspring of lions and tigers, or white tigers, which are also bred through artificial selection, Miquelle said. And zoos that offer cub petting and photos require a steady supply of very young cubs, since they become too dangerous to handle once they reach a few months of age. Constant breeding with no oversight results in animals of uncertain lineage that can't be released in the wild, suffer from health issues and genetic defects, and so are of no value to tiger conservation, according to Miquelle.

An indirect threat

Roadside zoos and the thousands of tigers they keep may even indirectly increase poaching of wild tigers for body parts that are sold in illegal wildlife markets, said Henry. Because tiger ownership in the U.S. isn't strongly regulated, no central agency tracks who owns tigers, where they keep the cats, when tigers are traded or sold, ""or what happens to their valuable parts when they die,"" Henry explained.

This means that when captive tigers in the U.S. die, their body parts could be funneled into the international illegal trade pipeline, perpetuating the demand for tiger parts for traditional medicines and folk remedies. That, in turn, could encourage more poaching in countries where tigers live, endangering wild populations, Henry said.

With the runaway popularity of ""Tiger King,"" — it was seen by 34.3 million people in the U.S. in its first 10 days — tigers are basking in the public spotlight. But viewers who are newly intrigued by the endangered cats and want to help them should do so by supporting legitimate zoos and conservation organizations that are fighting to protect tigers in their natural habitats and to pass legislation that will end the illegal wildlife trade and regulate tiger ownership, Goodrich told Live Science.

""Given adequate protections, wild tiger numbers will continue to increase across their natural range — but conservation efforts need to be focused on recovering these wild populations,"" he said."~[]

Catoosa, which is just a short drive from Tulsa, is home to a massive blue whale whose purpose is simply to amuse travelers. It's not every day that you get the chance to see a fish out of water, let alone a whale out of the water, and certainly not one this big.

The Blue Whale in Catoosa is looked forward to by every traveler along Route 66 who's interested in making a few memorable pit stops.

Whether you're an Oklahoma native or simply a visitor, it's definitely worth your while to stop by and check it out. With it being so close to a major city like Tulsa, the drive should be the least of your worries.

The Blue Whale in Catoosa built by a zoologist named Hugh S. Davis who completed the project with his friend Harold Thomas in July of 1972.

To this day it's owned and operated by Davis' daughter. They kept it in the family, how neat!

Originally, it served as a marker for swimming, fishing, and picnicking. Nowadays swimming is no longer allowed, though fishing and picnicking near the whale are still two very popular activities.

The whale is 20 feet tall and 80 feet long, so, it can fit just about anyone and anything. You can even pretend like you're in its mouth for a clever photo.

For as old as it is, it's looking cooler than ever.

The next time you're driving through Catoosa, be sure to give the Blue Whale a visit."~[]

Editor’s note: Netflix’s new docuseries “Tiger King” takes viewers into the strange world of big cat collectors. Featuring eccentric characters with names like Joe Exotic and Bhagavan “Doc” Antle, the series touches on polygamy, addiction, and personality cults while exploring a mysterious disappearance and a murder-for-hire.

To Allison Skidmore, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Santa Cruz who studies wildlife trafficking, the documentary didn’t bring enough attention to the scourge of captive big cats.

A former park ranger, Skidmore first started studying the issue in the U.S. after the infamous death of Cecil the Lion in Zimbabwe in 2015. She was shocked to learn about how little oversight there was stateside. We asked her about the legality, incentives, and ease of buying and selling tigers.

1. How many captive tigers are in the U.S.?

Unfortunately, there’s no straightforward answer. The vast majority of captive tigers are crossbred hybrids, so they aren’t identified as members of one of the six tiger subspecies – the Bengal tiger, Amur tiger, South China tiger, Sumatran tiger, Indochinese tiger, and Malayan tiger. Instead, they’re classified as “generic.”

Less than 5 percent – or fewer than 350 – of tigers in captivity are managed through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, a nonprofit organization that serves as an accrediting body in the U.S. They ensure accredited facilities meet higher standards of animal care than required by law.

All the rest are privately owned tigers, meaning they don’t belong to one of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ 236 sponsored institutions. These are considered generic and fall outside of federal oversight.

There’s no legal requirement to register these generic tigers, nor a comprehensive national database to track and monitor them. The best educated guess puts the number of tigers at around 10,000 in the U.S. Estimates put the global captive tiger population as high as 25,000.

In comparison, there are fewer than 4,000 tigers in the wild – down from 100,000 a century ago.

2. How do tigers change hands?

The Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna prevent the importation of tigers from the wild. So all tigers in the U.S. are born in captivity, with the rare exception of an orphaned wild cub that may end up in a zoo.

Only purebred tigers that are one of the six definitive subspecies are accounted for; these are the tigers you see in places like the Smithsonian National Zoo and generally belong to the Species Survival Plan, a captive breeding program designed to regulate the exchange of specific endangered species between member zoos in order to maintain genetic diversity.

All other tigers are found in zoos, sanctuaries, carnivals, wildlife parks, exhibits, and private homes that aren’t sanctioned by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. They can change hands in any number of ways, from online marketplaces to exotic animal auctions. They can be bought for as little as $800 to $2,000 for a cub and $200 to $500 for an adult, which is less expensive than many purebred dog puppies.

3. Can I legally buy a tiger?

The U.S. is plagued with complicated and vague laws concerning tiger ownership.

However, there are no federal statutes or regulations that expressly forbid private ownership of tigers. State and local jurisdictions have been given this authority, and some do pass bans or require permits. 32 states have bans or partial bans, and 14 states allow ownership with a simple license or permit. Four states – Alabama, Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Nevada – have no form of oversight or regulation at all.

An overarching, cohesive framework of regulations is missing, and even in states that ban private ownership, there are loopholes. For example, in all but three states, owners can apply for what’s called a “federal exhibitor license,” which is remarkably cheap and easy to obtain and circumvents any stricter state or local laws in place.

You now need a permit to transport tigers across state lines, but there’s still no permit required for intra-state travel.

4. What’s in it for the owners?

Some see it as a business venture, while others claim they care about conservation. I consider the latter reason insincere.

Many facilities promote themselves as wildlife refuges or sanctuaries. These places frame their breeding and exhibition practices as stewardship, as if they’re contributing to an endangered animal’s survival. The reality is that no captive tiger has ever been released into the wild, so it’s not like these facilities can augment wild populations. A true sanctuary or refuge should have a strict no breeding or handling policy and should have education programs dedicated to promoting conservation.

Ultimately, tigers are big money makers, especially tiger cubs. The Animal Welfare Act allows cub petting from eight to 12 weeks of age. People pay $100 to $700 to pet, bottle-feed, swim with, or take a photo with a cub.

None of these profits go toward the conservation of wild tigers, and this small window of opportunity for direct public contact means that exhibitors must continually breed tigers to maintain a constant supply of cubs.

The value of cubs declines significantly after 12 weeks. Where do all these surplus tigers go? Unfortunately, due to a lack of regulatory oversight, it’s hard to know.

Since many states don’t account for their live tigers, there’s also no oversight regarding the reporting and disposal of dead tigers. Wildlife criminologists fear that these tigers can easily end up in the black market where their parts can cumulatively be worth up to $70,000. There’s evidence of U.S. captive tigers tied to the domestic black market trade; in 2003, an owner of a tiger “rescue” facility was found to have 90 dead tigers in freezers on his property. And in 2001, an undercover investigation led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ended up leading to the prosecutions of 16 people for buying, selling, and slaughtering 19 tigers.

5. What role does social media play?

Posing with tigers on social media platforms like Instagram and on dating apps has become a huge problem. Not only can it create a health and safety risk for both the human and tiger, but it also fosters a false narrative.

If you see thousands of photos of people with captive tigers, it masks the true problem of endangered tigers in the wild. Some might wonder whether tigers are really so endangered if they’re so easy to pose with.

The reality of the wild tiger’s plight has become masked behind the pomp and pageantry of social media. This marginalizes meaningful ideas about conservation and the true status of tigers as one of the most endangered big cats.

I am referring to “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness,” a documentary about a roadside zookeeper in Oklahoma named Joe Exotic, a.k.a Joe Maldonado-Passage a.k.a Joe Schreibvogel. He ran one of the largest tiger breeding and cub-petting operations in the country.

Joe Exotic is serving a 22-year sentence for wildlife crimes and a murder-for-hire plot to kill an animal rights activist. He is the Charles Manson of animal cruelty.

Animals in cages are vulnerable and helpless. According to a lawyer for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, who testified at his trial, Joe Exotic shot five of his tigers in the head to free up space to board tigers for money and sold baby tigers to persons who he knew would crush their skulls with a hammer. He ripped months-old baby tiger cubs away from their mothers and declawed them, which is akin to cutting off a person’s fingers. It can cause lameness, psychological distress and even death to the animals.

Sure, Joe Exotic was exotic. He was a gay man in Oklahoma who had two-tone hair and a pistol and wore sequins; at one point, he had two husbands. Yes, we are all getting a little crazy in self-isolation, which is why the insanity of “Tiger King” may have been so appealing. And the people behind “Tiger King” appeared more interested in showing us Joe’s colorful life than what he did to his animals. The directors barely interviewed wildlife experts, who would have wiped away Joe’s appeal if allowed to describe his cruelty in detail in “Tiger King.”

All that still does not excuse rapper Cardi B’s tweet that, despite his proven crimes, she was going to start a GoFundMe for Joe. “He shall be free,” she wrote. (Now she says she was only fooling.) It doesn’t excuse actor Jared Leto posting a picture on Instagram of himself in a Joe Exotic costume; or Sylvester Stallone and his family dressing up as the cast of “Tiger King”; or an endless number of actors posing as Joe Exotic in publicly posted photos meant to land them a role in a movie version; or the fans who approached Joe’s staff members, even in a pandemic, to shake their hands and take pictures.

Many of Joe’s staff, according to an investigation by the Humane Society of the United States, abused, hit and mishandled animals. Yet the “bonus” episode of “Tiger King” was largely devoted to Joe’s business associates and employees. With smiles on their faces, they described how they have become celebrities and which actors should play them in a movie about Joe Exotic.

The Joe Exotic adulation will only encourage people to patronize private zoos like Joe’s. It certainly makes it easier for Joe Exotic to do his time because, according to “Tiger King’s” director, even in prison Joe’s fame has made him “happier than he has ever been.”

Joe Exotic and his accomplices deserve only revulsion and condemnation. A well-documented link exists between animal abuse, interpersonal violence and other serious crimes. As one study found, “indicators of animal abuse are remarkably similar to those of child abuse.” Forty-three percent of school shooters have abused animals. Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer impaled frogs, cats and dogs’ heads on sticks.

If any good is to come out of “Tiger King,” Congress must finally pass the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would go a long way to stopping the mistreatment of the thousands of privately owned big cats in the United States. Such a law would have prevented the owner of “Tony the Tiger” to keep a Bengal-Siberian tiger in a cage at a Louisiana road-side gas station named the Tiger Truck Stop.

When animal activists tried to stop the sickening spectacle, Joe Exotic rallied support for the tiger’s owner. Before it was finally euthanized because of health problems, the tiger had spent its life in that cage.

No one should be entertained by any of this.

A female Peregrin Falcon swoops up towards her nest on the south side in Little Falls.

by Dave Warner

A pair of Peregrin Falcons have built their nest in a small cave on the south side of the City for the third year in a row according to residents in the neighborhood. Wikipedia, says that the peregrine falcon, also known as the peregrine, and historically as the duck hawk in North America, is a widespread bird of prey in the family Falconidae. A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head.

The Peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 200 mph during its characteristic hunting stoop, which is a high-speed dive towards its prey, making it the fastest bird in the world, as well as the fastest member of the animal kingdom. Some birds have been clocked at more than 240 mph during their approach.

Deborah Saltis, a co-founder of the Utica Peregrine Falcon Project, has taken a keen interest in the pair that’s nesting in Little Falls. She says that she and Matt Perry started the project together and they are on their seventh nesting season in Utica, overlooking a pair of falcons named Astrid and Ares.

“I never knew anything about Peregrin Falcons before that. But, I realized that Little Falls was the perfect site for falcons. I’ve been watching this site for about six years and I could see whitewash on the rocks, but I could not figure out who was nesting there,” she said.

It wasn’t until this year that she found out that they were in that cave on the south side. “A gentleman called me and said he thought an injured hawk was on the radio tower. It didn’t make sense to me that a hawk would be on a tower injured, and I as I talked with him more, I realized he had a pair of falcons and he was seeing mating displays,” said Saltis.

She came into the City and watched them on the tower for over an hour one night, and decided to make several trips here before she was able to spot them going into the nest.

She gets extremely busy with watching the pair in Utica, which has a dedicated Facebook page, website, and cameras, that are live streaming what they are doing 24 hours a day.

However, now that she’s having to work from home, she’s able to get to watch the Little Falls pair a bit more than normal. “That’s worked out well for me.”

She says that the Eastern race of the Peregrine’s went extinct due to pesticides, which made the eggshells thin so that their nesting failed. “The Peregrin Falcons we now have are a mix of three races, European, the Western part of the United States, and Canada,” she stated.

“They’ve made an amazing comeback. There’s over seventy nesting pairs in the state of New York, seventeen or more of them in New York City alone. Pretty much every major bridge on the Hudson River from NYC to Albany has a pair of nesting falcons,” said Saltis.

However, the group wants to see them back in the Adirondacks, which is where they originally had a strong presence. “It’s wonderful to have them in a nestbox in Utica as we do and they’ve adapted to it, but this is their natural habitat and it is so wonderful to see them in a natural setting. It’s just amazing.”

She will keep a close eye on the pair in the City, because when the eggs hatch, the babies may get themselves in trouble once they start to leave the nest.

“We’ve had nineteen birds in Utica and we’ve had to rescue six. Sometimes they get exhausted and then they can’t get themselves back up high enough, or they get themselves into a situation that they just can’t figure out how to get out of.”

She says that the talons are like little grappling hooks and they may just cling to the side of a building if in trouble or scared.

“We just kind of have to wait for them to get to the ground actually. One we had to rescue on the roof of Grace Church in Utica. We actually had one of our people go out a window with a ladder there, and then scale another part of the roof to rescue this bird. I think we’re a little crazy, but that just goes with the territory,” she said."~[]

Although the world-famous wildlife park is closed to visitors Mr Hall wanted to show people that life for the animals is continuing as normal.

As well as shots of the park’s resident pack of European wolves, he also captured dramatic images of one of Longleat’s iconic lions along with a series of photographs of Amur tiger cubs Rusty and Yuki playfighting, resting and hanging out with mum Yana.

Native to the far east of Russia, the Amur tiger is the largest of the big cats and can weigh up to 300 kg and measure more than three metres in length.

In the 1930s the tigers had nearly died out due to hunting and logging. At one stage it is thought the population fell as low as just 20–30 animals.

Although they are still under severe threat their status was officially changed from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007.

“Despite all the dramatic changes taking place across the country, the animals here in the park are pretty much carrying on as if nothing has happened,” said Mr Hall.

“I wanted to give the tens of thousands of people who would normally be visiting at this time of the year a bit of an update and also provide them with some images they can share and enjoy.

“We are all hoping it won’t be too long before we welcome the public back but, until then, I plan to be regularly uploading new images online and sharing them on our various digital platforms,” he added.

Longleat opened the first drive-through safari park outside of Africa back in 1966 and has been welcoming millions of visitors through its gates ever since.

The last time the safari park had to close to the public was during foot and mouth restrictions back in 2001."~[]

Recently, the docu-series Tiger King aired and was watched by millions around the world. Unfortunately, it didn’t expose tiger captivity as it should have and not only are people supporting the animal abuser, but it didn’t do anything to show people just how terrible big cat captivity is. Animal abusers and people who think they should be able to own big cats as “pets” should be punished for it. That’s what happened with a famous model recently.

Qazel Yadegari is a famous Iranian model who was recently arrested in Istanbul. The model posted several photos and videos on Instagram showing her “pet” lion cub and python. One video even showed her kissing the lion cub’s neck. On another the lion cub is laying near where her dog is. Another video shows her driving with a python wrapped around her hand.

After investigating the illegal sale of exotic animals online, authorities came upon her posts. They found that the Asiatic lion cub and the python were smuggled into Instanbul. She and her two assistants were arrested. The animals were tranquilized and confiscated.

The model claims she was keeping the animals as a hobby, but wild animals are not “pets” or hobbies. People who think they are fuel the illegal wildlife trade and drive animals to extinction.

Sign this petition to support the Big Cat Public Safety Act and put an end to big cat ownership.

modern world‘if dream wildlife interact wildlife wild compare seeing big cat sad state cage kieran harkin euronewsthere legitimate sanctuary place go animal home~"The number of captive tigers in Europe and the US is more than double the number left in the wild, according to a new report.

There are at least 1,600 captive tigers in Europe, compared to just 3,900 wild globally, says the global animal welfare organisation, FOUR PAWS.

FOUR PAWS state that tigers and cubs are being used as photo props and for selfies at facilities in countries including France, Germany, Spain and Malta.

""We know of one place where it is €50 for 10 minutes with a big cat cub,"" said Kieran Harkin, Head of Wildlife Animals in Trade at FOUR PAWS International.

It is estimated that many tigers eventually “lose their commercial value” and their body parts are sold for use in “traditional medicine” in Asian markets like China and Vietnam.

Previous data from 2018 had officially documented only 698 captive tigers in Europe, according to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

The new report comes just one month after a controversial Netflix true crime documentary ‘Tiger King’ exposed the breeding and trade of tigers in the United States.

FOUR PAWS told Euronews their concern that the demand for breeding cubs could result in a ""never-ending cycle"".

Horror stories of tigers being driven ""in the back of cars""

The private ownership of exotic pets, and the use of tigers in circuses is still legal in a number of EU countries, but FOUR PAWS says the trade is “poorly regulated and monitored” and many animals are suffering abuse in terrible conditions.

""Its quite easy for anyone to source and purchase a tiger in countries where private keeping is still legal,"" Kieran Harkin told Euronews.

""You only need to show enclosures and some authorities are not qualified enough to check if these enclosures are adequate enough for a tiger’s welfare"".

While owners usually have to apply for import and export permits, but Kieran Harkin says the European Union offers an exemption to this across borders.

""There are very few checks and we have heard all sorts of horror stories of people driving tigers and other big cat species in the back of cars"".

Most European countries also require prospective owners to have a licence for keeping a dangerous animal, but Harkin says the application and issuing of these licenses is ""also quite an easy process"".

FOUR PAWS also told Euronews that the sale of tigers for commercial gain can be a ""highly lucrative industry"".

A live tiger captive-bred in Europe can reportedly be worth up to €22,000, while a kilo of tiger bones could be valued at €1,700.

Which European countries have the most captive tigers?

CITES prohibits the commercial trade of wild tigers, and aims to ensure that any legal trade of tigers and parts has no impact on the survival of the species. But captive tigers are listed under a separate CITES Appendix, which does allow for their legal trade.

The Czech Republic and Germany have reported the highest figures of captive tigers in Europe, with 180 and 164 respectively.

Meanwhile, the United Kingdom, where the private keeping of captive tigers is legal, is third in the continent with 123 recorded animals.

Slovakia also reported 119 captive tigers, despite CITES recording just 3 in the EU country in 2018.

Just 17 of the 36 European countries contacted by FOUR PAWS, including only 12 EU member states, responded with figures.

NGOs estimate that Italy, one of those countries which did not respond, has 400 tigers kept in zoos, private homes and circuses.

FOUR PAWS says that many captive animals cannot be rehabilitated into the wild, while their illegal trade also fuels the demand for worldwide poaching of wild tigers.

""There will always be a higher onus on a wild tiger than a captive tiger, so by stimulating a greater demand for captive tigers, you’re actually placing more threat on wild populations,"" said Harkin.

""More efforts are needed,"" admits the EU as further measures considered

FOUR PAWS has urgently called on the European Union to ""suspend the export and re-export of live tigers and tiger parts"", except to legitimate sanctuaries.

The animal welfare organisation has further recommended that the EU introduces a comprehensive ban on commercial tiger trade to combat animal abuse.

""We need the EU to turn off the tap and stop this influx of tigers, and stop this breeding and distribution of tigers for different reasons, for circuses, for private keeping, and for petting across Europe,"" Harkin told Euronews.

""If we stop the commercial trade, and the only tigers that we see or are being bred across Europe have a legitimate conservation process, then that’s the ideal situation"".

""We do not need to be petting tigers, breeding hybrids and all this other entertainment"".

FOUR PAWS has previously launched projects focusing on the suffering of animals which are kept in inappropriate conditions, as well as in disaster and conflict zones.

The European Commission adopted an Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking in February 2016 to improve efforts against wildlife crime in the EU.

But despite encouraging signs, the Commission has said that “more efforts are needed” to combat the illegal trade of exotic animals.

“Wildlife trafficking continues to pose a serious threat to biodiversity, the rule of law and sustainable development, said Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for the Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, in 2018.

“We need to further intensify our efforts to reach the objectives of the Action Plan by 2020, and meet the target of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”.

""The European Union have been very good, working in other areas of the world when it comes to illegal wildlife trade,"" said Harkin, ""but it needs to look internally at its own jurisdictions"".

""We need a greater political appetite to do more and greater enforcement in Europe"".

Progress on the European Commission action plan is due to be assessed later this year. In a further statement to Euronews, a Commission source agreed that tigers need to be strictly protected.

""The Commission has therefore closely followed the recent cases of illegal trade in tigers in several EU Member States, and facilitated the exchange of relevant information among enforcement authorities through its expert group on wildlife trade enforcement.""

The EU say that, while there is no central register of tigers kept in the EU, authorities with member states have the responsibility and capability to control the keeping and breeding of tigers.

""The Commission has intensified its cooperation with the relevant enforcement authorities of the Member States and has asked them to pay special attention to these issues.""

""[We] will continue to monitor the situation, together with the CITES authorities of EU Member States and will consider whether further measures at EU level are needed.""

FOUR PAWS says they are also reaching out to members of the public to not take part in private interactions with big cats and recognise that ""these are not acceptable places in the modern world"".

‘If it is your dream wildlife or to interact with wildlife, do it in the wild - it does not compare with seeing a big cat in a sad state in a cage,"" Kieran Harkin told Euronews.

""There are legitimate sanctuaries and places to go and see the animals, and it is not in your own home."""~['US']

These findings, by researchers at the Institute of Zoology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have implications on the conservation of both highly endangered species.

The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is endemic to the Himalaya and Hengduan Mountains, with its distribution spanning China, Myanmar, Bhutan, India and Nepal. Prior to 1902, all red pandas were classified as a single species. However, in 1902, scientists established two subspecies based on their morphological differences, namely the Himalayan subspecies (A. f. fulgens) and the Chinese subspecies (A. f. styani).

More recent research on their morphological differences and geographical distribution, however, led the taxonomist Colin Groves to reclassify the two subspecies as two distinct species: the Himalayan red panda (A. fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (A. styani). Despite this change, the evolutionary histories of Himalayan and Chinese red pandas have remained unclear and controversy has persisted about whether they should be classified as two distinct species or not.

In order to help clarify these questions, a research team led by Professor Wei Fuwen used population genomics methods to analyze the genome resequencing data of 65 wild red pandas from seven geographical populations; mitochondrial genomes of 49 red pandas; and Y chromosome single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from 49 male individuals.

All results from these three types of markers found substantial genetic divergence between the two species, and no sharing was found for the haplotypes of mitochondrial genome and Y chromosome SNPs.

These findings clearly support Groves’ classification of red pandas into two phylogenetic species. Further analysis also found that the Yalu Zangbu River, rather than the Nujiang River, is most likely the geographical boundary between the two species. This explains previous observations that the discriminating morphological characteristics were inconsistent with their geographical distributions.

Furthermore, the research team reconstructed the demographic and divergence histories of the two species based on the genome resequencing data. The results revealed clearly different demographic histories for the two species: The Chinese red panda had experienced two population bottlenecks and one large population expansion, whereas the Himalayan red panda had experienced three bottlenecks and one very small expansion. These two species started to diverge after the serious population bottleneck caused by the Penultimate Glaciation (0.3 to 0.13 Mya).

In contrast to the Chinese red panda, the Himalayan red panda has less genetic diversity, higher linkage disequilibrium and a higher genetic load, thus highlighting the urgency of protecting this endangered species. These findings have important conservation implications for wild red panda conservation, pedigree construction and interbreeding avoidance for captive red pandas.

The zoo released footage on April 18 that shows its 400-pound male Amur tiger, Yuri, as he attempts to master a wooden ramp in his enclosure.

According to the zoo, Yuri’s female counterpart, Nikita, has no qualms about using the ramp. She was a “queen of the catwalk,” they said, compared to the more reluctant Yuri. However, “with our guests away, and with lots of encouragement,” the zoo said, Yuri finally conquered the ramp.

Last year we streamed the birds live 24/7 on the CTV Falcon Cam. This year, because of network demands in the face of the global pandemic, we are starting a little bit later than usual, but we are pleased to be able to stream the falcons for our viewers once again!

We first reported on the peregrine falcons when they arrived in 2013, and since, they have returned almost every year to their high vantage point above mid-town Kitchener.

This year, the Canadian Peregrine Foundation says the returning birds are likely the same as those from the year before, though they can't be 100 per cent sure.

Details of this study are published Wednesday in the journal PeerJ, in which Oregon State University researchers discuss their findings about the feeding habits of these ocean giants.

Blue whales currently hold the title of being the largest mammals on Earth, reaching 70 to 90 feet long and weighing in at 200,000 to 300,000 pounds. It’s difficult to fathom just how large these creatures are: roughly the length of three school buses, with hearts the size of a small car.

Because of their enormous size, the whales must balance the energy gained through their food intake with the energy costs of feeding, which involves diving, holding their breath or opening their mouths, which slows their movement in the water. They have an added challenge: Their prey of choice are tiny krill, and the whales have to find and eat large volumes of them to make any energetic headway.

“People think about whales having to dive deep to get to the densest prey patches, but if they can find their prey in shallow waters, it’s actually more energetically profitable to feed near the surface,” said Leigh Torres, an assistant professor and director of the Geospatial Ecology of Marine Megafauna Laboratory at OSU’s Marine Mammal Institute.

Co-authors of the study include Dawn Barlow, a doctoral student in Torres’ lab, Todd Chandler, who was responsible for capturing drone footage used in the study, and Jonathan Burnett of OSU’s Aerial Information Systems Laboratory.

“In this population of whales in New Zealand, they foraged more in areas where their prey was dense and shallow,” Torres continued. “Their dives were relatively short, and they were feeding more at the surface, which requires less energy.”

A great deal of what researchers know about blue whale foraging consists of data collected from tags placed on the whales, which record travel and diving patterns, including acceleration, or lunging, toward patches of food. Surface feeding on the other hand is not as well understood, partly because it is harder to analyze tag data and quantify the size of prey patches at the water’s surface, Barlow said.

During a 2017 field research trip off the coast of New Zealand to study blue whales, Torres and her team observed surface feeding from their boat on multiple occasions. They noted the density of the krill patches was greater the closer they were to the surface.

The data researchers collected from this trip showed that blue whales had relatively short dive times overall, spanning about 2.5 minutes. This was interesting when compared to other blue whale populations, such as those off the coast of California which average dives of about 10 minutes. When they observed the surface foraging, the dive time of New Zealand blue whales dropped even more, down to 1.75 minutes.

The researchers used a drone to capture stunning footage of a blue whale surface feeding on a patch of krill, which illustrated the feeding process in never-before-seen detail including decision-making about whether or not to eat patches of krill near the ocean’s surface. This video was first shared first publicly after the research trip and it went viral, giving researchers another source of data to describe surface feeding behavior.

“The drone footage fills a gap in our understanding of surface feeding,” Barlow said.

This valuable footage allowed the researchers to see how the whale used its right eye to target the prey. They were able to quantify the recognition distance from the whale to the prey and could measure how widely the whale opened its mouth to feed. They also saw from the footage showed the whale’s decision to rotate from one side to the other to better capture the krill.

“The video allows us to describe a lot of really cool kinematics and body movement coordination by the whale that we haven’t been able to see before,” Torres said.

“The footage also allowed us to see the prey response in new way. We can see when the krill begin to flee as the whale approaches, which is really amazing. At the whale’s fastest speed and acceleration, the krill begin to jump away just eight tenths of a second before the whale strikes at the krill patch,” Torres continued.

Torres added that though they had surface-feeding footage from just one whale, the footage included four encounters between that whale and surface prey patches, providing insight into decision-making processes by the whale in response to the size and orientation of the prey patches.

“This footage highlights the value of using drones for study and observation of whales,” she said. “Drone footage could be a good complement to data collected from tags for studying surface behaviors of whales.”"~[]

Masks are now required when caring for cats at the Greater Vancouver Zoo in Aldergrove, after a tiger in an American zoo tested positive for COVID-19.

“We have implemented increased precautionary measures such as all animal care staff are required to wear masks in specific situations particularly when in close proximity to felines,” animal care manager Menita Prasad said.

“As this is the first case of its kind, we are aware that certain animal species are more susceptible to contracting COVID-19,” she explained.

News broke in early April that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the corona-virus, after showing respiratory symptoms on March 27, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

The Aldergrove zoo has lions, a Siberian tiger, and cheetah that fit into the feline category.

Prasad said, prior to the instance, the zoo follows safety protocols to “minimize disease transmission” between animals and staff.

As COVID-19 cases have emerged in Langley, and the first animal transmission of the virus has struck the U.S., staff at the local zoo and the animals they care for continue to practise social distancing.

The 120-acre facility has been closed to the public, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, since March 18.

COVID-19 and pet owners

The same U.S. Agriculture Department report that revealed a tiger at the Bronx Zoo was infected with COVID, encouraged everyday pet owners, if sick, to “wash their hands before and after the interaction.”

And if COVID-positive, people should restrict contact with their pets and animals, it said.

Conversely, “at this time, there is no evidence to suggest that any animals, including pets or livestock, can spread COVID-19 infection to people,” it added.

And he's eating well.

The white cat is one of the star attractions at African Lion Safari, a wildlife park that has straddled the Cambridge-Hamilton border for the past 50 years.

And while some Ontario zoos are struggling with the hefty costs involved in feeding their animals during the COVID-19 shutdown, African Lion Safari staff say they're holding up just fine.

""Like most companies we are affected by COVID,"" said general manager Trish Gerth. ""We'll see some lost revenue depending on when and if we open.

""But ... we're privately owned. We're self-funded. We prepare for different types of emergency situations, so we are financially prepared to carry on and care and feed the animals.""

Other parks are feeling a bit caged in.

The Toronto Zoo has launched a fundraising effort in hopes of collecting $100,000 to help feed its 5,000 animals, whose dining bill comes in at around $1 million per year.

The Twin Valley Zoo in Brantford is also trying to raise $100,000 with a GoFundMe campaign for its brood and is almost halfway there.

Feeding the more than 1,000 animals at African Lion Safari, which includes elephants, giraffes, monkeys and lions, is one of the park's biggest expenses.

And the bottom line is taking a hit.

All zoos rely heavily on admission fees to help feed the flocks, prides and packs. Spring is especially busy with school trips. And the popularity of the Netflix show ""Tiger King,"" which profiles big cat owners, could also drive customers to the park to see the lions and cheetahs.

African Lion Safari is seasonal and runs from May to late September but it won't meet its May 2 opening date this year due to the pandemic.

""We're kind of in the same boat as everybody else,"" said Gerth. ""We have to see what government restrictions are lifted in that time frame. We're essential because of the animal care but the attraction part we wouldn't really be considered essential.""

Gerth said her team is considering various operating scenarios including a drive-through only option for customers. The park is also looking to see if it qualifies for any government relief.

""Everything is kind of up in the air,"" she said. ""We don't know what is happening yet. We're preparing for when we can open.""

As for the animals, they're readying for the crowd.

""Just like us, we're all excited to have visitors come,"" said Gerth.

The extensive counting exercise, which is taken up every five years, was to begin next month and preparations for it were on in full swing, but it has now been postponed because of the unprecedented coronavirus crisis, he said.

Gujarat has so far reported 2,407 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths due to the disease.

""In view of the lockdown, the lion census will not take place in May. A decision on the census will be taken only after things become clear on the coronavirus situation and the lockdown, Chief Conservator of Forest, Junagadh division, D T Vasavda told PTI.

Initially, it was decided to conduct the census in May and then it was postponed to June, but now it all depends on the situation, he said.

The Gir Wildlife Sanctuary, which is the only abode of Asiatic lions, remains closed during the monsoon season from June-end to October, which is also the mating period of big cats, another official said, adding that the census is most unlikely at that time.

During the last census conducted in May 2015, 523 lions were found in the Gir forest.

The state has succeeded in conserving lions in the Gir forest, where their numbers dwindled to just over a dozen in the early 20th century.

The erstwhile Nawab of Junagadh, Mahabat Khan, had then banned shooting of lions.

Due to conservation efforts of the state authorities after Independence, the number of wild cats has steadily gone up in Gir.

At present, lions are found in seven districts - Junagadh, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Gir Somnath, Botad, Porbandar and Rajkot - surrounding the Gir forest area.

At times, they stray into farms in these districts and sometimes enter cities and towns located on the periphery of the sanctuary.

In the images we can see how the whale attacks the krill herd with minimal effort and maintains its energy.

Blue whales, which are considered to be the largest mammal in the world with their lengths of up to 30 meters, are not fed with large and satisfying foods, contrary to popular belief. So much so that there are shrimp-like krills only 1/2 cm in length at the top of the feeding chain of these creatures.

As you can imagine, a huge creature needs to catch these small and crustaceans in herd to feed them. In doing so, they have to be as smart as opening a huge-sized mouth for a single shell can burn more calories than calories from a meal. The new study, published in PeerJ magazine, explains exactly this topic, how blue whales conserve their energy while feeding on water.

Eating near the surface saves energy for blue whales:

Although having a huge body makes blue whales very strong against attacks from outside, there are some costs to carry this body. Being drawn deep into the water to look for feed; it requires high energy-consuming maneuvers for diving whales, such as diving, breathing and sudden turns. For this reason, it may be much wiser to feed near the surface of the water.

Speaking about this, academician Leigh Torres says that whales can save more energy by hunting in shallow and near the surface. Discovering that herds of krill are more intense towards the surface in field investigations along the shores of New Zealand, Torres and his team state that whales will dive for less time, hold their breath less and spend less energy by targeting these prey.

The feeding moments of a blue whale were recorded with drones:

Research findings say that blue whales near New Zealand have relatively shorter dive times compared to blue whale populations on the California coast. In addition, the images recorded with drones clearly show that whales made a decision as to whether it is worth surfacing for a krill herd.

Talking about the images recorded by the drones, Torres said, “The video allows us to define many great kinematics and body motion coordination that whales have not seen before. The images also allowed us to see the reaction of the hunt in a new way. We can see that as the whale approaches, the krill begins to escape, which is really surprising. ”

Researchers say that findings based on drone images are derived only from the behavior of a whale, and these findings cannot be adapted to wider blue whale populations. Still, the images contain very striking data on the feeding ritual of blue whales.

It feels like the third season of Nat Geo WILD’s Secrets of the Zoo just started. Surprisingly, it’s already time for the season finale with “Cheetah Play Date,” premiering Sunday, April 26th, at 9:00 pm ET. Animal lovers will get an up-close look at the titular big cats, plus mandrills, red pandas, and Pallas’ cats.

The episode’s title comes from one specific Cheetah who is not a fan of the Zoo’s manager. The care team tries to get her more comfortable by wearing wigs that resemble other people in preparation for the annual cheetah vaccinations. Does the trick work? Viewers will have to tune in to find out.

The story that really steals the show is about an elderly mandrill, one of a group of older females known as “The Golden Girls.” After having blood in her urine, an examination is done that finds a mass on her uterus, which is common for primates of her age. I get queasy easily and there were times where I had to look away, but this is the part of the episode that stayed with me after it was over. It was also fun to learn that primates like to watch TV.

The Columbus Zoo has some endangered Pallas’ cats, also known as “Nature’s grumpy cat,” and the breeding season is almost over without any pregnancies. The team intervenes and viewers will learn how vets try to help things along for this endangered species.

The cutest part of this episode comes from a red panda getting a dental exam. He’s been having some dental issues from eating too many fruit treats. Not only is his face cute, but he walks with a waddle that will make viewers melt.

Secrets of the Zoo is a really fun show that viewers can pick up at anytime. The series is coming to Disney+ on May 1st and subscribers can get a head start with this season three finale and reruns on Nat Geo WILD. The season three finale begins Sunday, April 26th, at 9:00 pm ET only on Nat Geo WILD."~[]

A 6-month-old giant panda met visitors to the Shanghai Wild Animal Park in the Pudong New Area on Saturday.

The giant panda, who is yet to be officially named, is known as ""Jia Jia boy"" to zookeepers as his mother is named Jia Jia. He was born on October 6 last year, and weighed 185 grams at birth.

He grew to 1,542 grams when he was one month, and now he is over 18 kilograms, leading to his other nickname ""little fatty.""

He was timid and slender when he was born but is now chubby with large eyes, animal keepers said.

He is also very active, naughty and bold, and likes climbing.

But he sometimes acts like a spoilt child, snatching food from his mother and distracting her while she is trying to feed.



The park operator has installed several screens showing a video clip of the boy's growth, and a real-time live broadcast at the giant panda area.

Visitors are reminded to keep quiet and not use flash photography when viewing the pandas.

As previously reported Winnie and Chester, the cathedral's resident peregrine falcons, had five eggs in incubation.

But it has been confirmed that at least one chick has already hatched.

Keith Betton of the Hampshire Ornithological Society, who is advising the cathedral on looking after the birds, has this to say. “Winnie has hatched her first chick this morning. At 10am she was eating the eggshell – not wanting to waste valuable calcium.

""The next chicks are expected soon. They will be carefully guarded and kept warm by her for the first 7 to10 days and then she will leave them to go hunting.

""Until then Chester will be delivering food on a regular basis, but as the chicks are tiny at this stage we don’t expect to see a lot of him.""

Although lockdown means most people are unable to visit the cathedral, the falcons can be watched online via the webcam: www.winchester-cathedral.org.uk/the-peregrines-return-in-2020/."~[]

Follow CleanTechnica on Google News.

April 27th, 2020 by Remeredzai Joseph Kuhudzai

BMW South Africa has been at the forefront of promoting electric mobility in South Africa. The BMW i3 has been the only electric model that has been consistently available in South Africa since 2015, hence it is tops of the all-time sales charts with 405 units sold since 2015.

BMW South Africa brought the first-generation i3 that had the 60 Ah battery cells in 2015. It then went on to bring both upgrades of the i3, the one with 90 Ah battery cells and now the current 120 Ah cells, to South Africa. BMW also retails several plugin hybrid models, including the 330e, the 7 Series, the i8 Roadster, and the BMW X5 xDrive45e. BMW SA is now also bringing the Mini-E that is expected to be priced from about R589,000. This will make it start at a price that is just a bit cheaper than the i3, which is priced from around R700,000.

Despite only 1,119 EVs having been sold in South Africa since 2015, BMW and Jaguar seem to believe in the potential of this market. Jaguar has recently been rewarded for bringing the I-PACE to South Africa as it has just been named the 2020 AutoTrader Car of the Year. This is the first time the award has been won by a Jaguar and also the first time in its 34-year history that the award has been given to an electric car.

VW SA, which has been a popular brand traditionally in South Africa due to its gas/diesel vehicles — such as the Polo, Polo Vivo, the Jetta, and of course the Golf — has adopted a more measured approach. Its first electric vehicle in South Africa will be the ID.4 and it will only arrive in South Africa in 2022! Between now and then, VW will bring 6 e-Golfs to be used as courtesy vehicles by VW customers bringing in their gas/diesel vehicles for service, etc., for them to get a feel of electric mobility.

The e-Golfs will also be used by motor vehicle journalists, by VW employees, and by select dealerships as demo models to gauge customer insights. VW will expand the trial by including the ID.3 hatchback in 2021. It’s a shame that the ID.3 will not be sold in South Africa just yet. This Golf-sized hatchback could have been a decent option for some VW enthusiasts to transition to electric mobility. There is a thought that the market would probably prefer the ID.4, as recent trends show consumers moving to small SUVs from hatchbacks. Still, it would have been great to see the ID.3 being sold in South Africa as we wait for the ID.4. We desperately need more electric models to be made available in South Africa to give customers more options to choose from and thus catalyze the electric vehicle market in South Africa. After all, buyers can only choose from what’s in front of them.

South Africa’s punitive duties and taxes on imported EVs do not help the industry. Electric vehicles attract a customs duty of 25%, while for petrol and diesel vehicles it is 18%. On top of this, there is the Ad Valorem Customs Excise Duties and VAT, which push the sticker prices of EVs much higher than gas/diesel vehicles in similar segments. Perhaps then the likes of VW could start with some cheaper options in their stable, such as the new e-Up. It could be a nice option for South Africans with its 200 km real-world range powered by its 32.3 kWh battery. If they really need to do some trials to get some customer insights, would a 6-month trial period including some e-Ups not work? A 2-year trial seems such a long one especially when other automakers such as BMW and Jaguar have already taken the plunge.

A six-month-old giant panda cub met with visitors at the Shanghai Wild Animal Park in Pudong New Area on Saturday.



The cub, which has yet to be given a name, was born on October 6 and is the offspring of another giant panda Jia Jia which lives in the park.



The cub, which weighed just 185 grams at birth, now weighs more than 18 kilograms.



According to the animal keeper, the baby panda used to be slim and timid but now loves climbing to high places. It also likes to stay with his mother and has been learning how to chew bamboo.



To allow visitors to learn more about the panda cub, the park has documented its growth in a short video that is being showcased at the venue."~[]

The proud parents, Adele and Frank, live atop the 14th floor of the 54 story skyscraper at 55 Water Street, and have found fame online thanks to a webcam that broadcasts the birds as they raise their hatchlings each spring.

Peregrine falcons have lived at 55 Water St. since back in 1999, when the first generation of falcons, Jack and Diane, moved in. Peregrines are listed as an endangered species in New York State but experts say their numbers have been growing steadily since the early eighties.



As of Tuesday morning, just one of their babies looks to have hatched but it appears at least two other eggs are being cared for in the nest as well. This time last year the falcons laid four eggs in the same spot.

Coalition, Humane Society International, Blood Lions and Born Free Foundation, are calling on the World Health Organisation to release a formal position statement in support of a global ban on wildlife markets selling wild animals or products, in light of the risk to public health.

The groups have written a second open letter to the WHO in response to a statement by WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus calling on governments to “rigorously enforce bans on the sale and trade of wildlife for food”, but falling short of calling for a global prohibition despite the risk of COVID-19 and future zoonotic diseases.

At a media briefing on April 17 Dr Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “Wet markets are an important source of affordable food and livelihood for millions of people all over the world. But in many places, they have been poorly regulated and poorly maintained.





“WHO’s position is that when these markets are allowed to reopen, it should only be on the condition that they conform to stringent food safety and hygiene standards. Governments must rigorously enforce bans on the sale and trade of wildlife for food.

“WHO has worked closely with the World Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, to develop guidance on the safe operation of markets. Because an estimated 70% of all new viruses come from animals, we also work together closely to understand and prevent pathogens crossing from animals to humans.”

Whilst the organisations applaud the WHO for stating that governments must rigorously enforce bans on the sale and trade of wildlife for food due to the public health risk, they emphasise the need to comprehensively tackle the commercial trade in wildlife by also closing markets that sell live wild animals or products for other purposes such as traditional medicine.

The broad coalition of organisations is calling on the WHO to release a formal position statement containing clear advice to all governments to introduce comprehensive bans.

Dr Teresa Telecky, vice president of Wildlife, Humane Society International, said “Wildlife markets around the world have long been implicated in global pandemics, not just COVID-19 but before that Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and the Ebola virus epidemics in West and Central Africa.

“It is vital that this dangerous and cruel trade in wildlife for consumption, fur, exotic pets and traditional medicinal purposes are tackled head on as they all pose threats to human health. We need the world to act now, to protect people and animals.”

Dr Louise de Waal, campaign manager for Blood Lions, said:“We would like to emphasise that our focus is on the need to tackle the commercial trade in wildlife, and to close markets that sell live wild animals or products, rather than markets where other types of fresh produce might be traded enabling food security.”

Dr Mark Jones, head of policy at the Born Free Foundation, said: “Born Free welcomes the statement from Dr Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of the World Health Organisation.

“However, if we are to prevent future pandemics, we must go much further and implement the kind of transformative changes to our relationship with wildlife that will truly start to heal the damage we are causing to the planet’s biodiversity.

“We therefore urge the WHO to work alongside governments and other intergovernmental organisations to ban wildlife markets and bring an end to the commercial wildlife trade, alongside intensive and rigorous enforcement and measures to protect and enhance wildlife habitats, so as to halt and reverse the devastating declines in the natural world that have brought a million species to the brink of extinction and threaten the future of wildlife and humanity alike.”

The organisations join other public health experts, scientists and political leaders including Dr David Nabarro (WHO Special Envoy on COVID-19) and Ms. Elizabeth Maruma Mrema (acting Executive Secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity) who acknowledge that banning wildlife markets must be a top priority to protect against future pandemics.

Fast facts:

Zoonotic diseases are responsible for over two billion cases of human illness and over two million human deaths each year.

Sixty percent of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic and 70% of these are thought to originate from wildlife.

Risk of disease transmission is prevalent across all aspects of wildlife trade, which also supplies products to the Traditional Medicine industry.

Chinese academics have called on the government to support transitioning the wildlife farming industry away from the production of Traditional Medicine, as studies have highlighted that over 80% of Traditional Medicine consumers would consider herbal or synthetic alternatives to wild animal products.

In South Africa, there is a legal lion bone trade that primarily feeds the Asian market for traditional medicine, as well as luxury items that serve as a status symbol. Currently, there are approximately 12,000 lions –living in captive facilities to supply this industry – 4 times more than the entire South African wild lion population.

The consumption of wildlife products like lion bones has been linked to zoonotic diseases, and the captive conditions are conducive to the development of new emerging pathogens.

On Tuesday morning, the zoo announced that the cubs are healthy and bonding out of public view in the Benson Predator Ridge. Zoo staff haven’t been able to identify their genders, but said the cubs’ mother is 4-year-old Kamara and the father is 4-year-old Tobias. Tobias was brought to the Denver Zoo in December 2018 in hopes he would father cubs.

Assistant Curator of Predators Matt Lenyo said staff are watching Kamara closely to ensure she’s showing appropriate maternal behaviors toward the cubs. This includes nursing and grooming. The trio will primarily stay in their den box, which was set up to mimic the kind of space a wild lion would seek out to give birth.

He said Kamara learned a lot from watching her mother, 7-year-old Neliah, take care of her own cub, Tatu, who was born in July 2019. Tatu was also fathered by Tobias.

Mother and cubs will stay behind the scenes for about two months to give them time to bond, the zoo said. At that point, they’ll be slowly introduced the cubs to the rest of the pack: unrelated 7-year-old female named Sabi, Neliah and Tatu."~[]

2 minute read

This morning (Wednesday 29th April) the first of four eggs hatched and just a few hours later another one is out.

The second peregrine falcon egg hatched earlier today, just one day after the Cathedral celebrated it's 800th anniversary of the first foundation stones being laid.

It's a long process, normally taking around 72 hours from the start of the shell cracking to the full hatching.

Incubation of the peregrine falcon eggs lasts for around 32 days after the final egg is laid - with this hatching a couple of days ahead of schedule.

We can expect the other two to appear over the next week or so.

Both chicks are up and feeding!

HOW BIG ARE THE CHICKS?

Newly hatched peregrines weigh an average of just one and a half ounces, but that will double within a week, and they grow to 10 times heavier in just three weeks!

That means the falcon mum will be very busy with finding food for the chicks!

It's feeding time on the tower! A second peregrine chick has hatched and is joining its sibling for their first ever meal. #SalisburyPeregrines pic.twitter.com/abtdHeYLt1 — Salisbury Cathedral (@SalisburyCath) April 29, 2020

The babies are born with white fluffy down, developing feathers after about three weeks, and fledging (starting to fly) at around eight weeks.

We can keep any eye on the peregrines, big and small, through the webcams set up by Salisbury Cathedral.

They've been very popular in recent weeks, with more than 120,000 views on the feeds since the first egg was laid there."~[]

But the threat posed by the virus to Malaika, who was rescued by the Limbe Wildlife Centre 15 years ago when someone tried to sell her as a pet, goes well beyond actual infection.

The centre, home to hundreds of gorillas, chimpanzees and other primates, has seen half its revenues evaporate in recent months with park visits cancelled and cash-strapped donors in the U.S. and Europe freezing their contributions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Without a resumption of funding within the next three months, the centre, a partnership between the Cameroonian government and an international foundation, could be forced to close its doors, said Guillaume Le Flohic, the park manager.

“The animal food - we have to raise the money for that. If we don’t have the money we cannot pay for the food,” he said, adding that the centre has seen its expenses balloon because of the need for bio-safety measures.

Cameroon has recorded more than 1,600 cases of COVID-19 in central Africa’s largest outbreak.

Similar financial pressures are being felt by wildlife reserves and conservancies across Africa, where money from tourism and foreign donations typically bankrolls efforts to protect the continent’s most endangered animals from poachers and habitat loss.

Besides vulnerable primates like Mandrills, the Limbe centre rescues dozens of African gray parrots, one of the world’s most trafficked animals, each year.

Le Flohic said he did not know what would happen to the animals if the park cannot come up with the more than $15,000 it needs for monthly operating expenses.

“All our activity and the reason why we are working here, we will have to put that on hold and that is really not a situation I want to be in, but that is the situation we may face,” he said."~[]

Tiger Woods comeback you’ve probably forgotten about

Welcome back to the Tiger Woods YouTube Project, where we’re in the midst of a winning streak. Oh, and Tiger is, too. Today, Bay Area resident Josh Sens breaks down one of Woods’ most unlikely comeback victories on a Monday finish at Pebble Beach in 2000.

Yeah, we already borrowed one video from 2000, but that was a heck of a year — which means it’s worth reinforcing from a few different angles. Before we join the action, let’s contextualize where Tiger Woods was competitively at this point in time. He’d finished off 1999 with wins in seven of his final 10 PGA Tour events, including his last four: two WGCs, the Tour Championship and the National Car Rental Classic at Disney.

Then 2000 began at the Mercedes Championship in Maui, where Woods and Ernie Els entered Sunday tied and remained that way heading to No. 18, where each made eagle (I repeat: each made eagle!) to get into a playoff. Woods birdied the first playoff hole and poured in a 40-footer on the second to win. In summary, it didn’t seem like Woods could lose at this point.

Tiger Woods YouTube Project, Chapter 16: The ridiculous comeback

RELATED: Chapter 15 — “How Tiger and MJ became friends”

But it sure started to look like Woods would finally lose in his next start out. Midway through the final round at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he trailed by 7 shots. You already know what happened later that summer at Pebble, when Woods ran and hid from the rest of the field in a 15-shot romp. But you may well have forgotten the biggest late charge of his career. Let’s rewatch the film, shall we? And then we’ll hear from Northern California correspondent Josh Sens.

Here’s Josh Sens, proud Oakland resident, with 10 takeaways upon rewatching Woods alongside the rest of you. Enjoy!

1. For starters, Tiger was so much younger. Granted, we all were. But what makes Tiger’s youth so striking in these clips is the fact that he was playing like a man among boys. This was skinny Tiger, pre-bulked up Tiger, and he’s practically swimming in his Sunday red (except that it’s a Monday; more on that in a minute). He also almost sounds like pre-pubescent Tiger. Listen to his voice, caught on microphone here and there. It’s that youthful nasal twang that is still evident when he speaks today but now not nearly as pronounced. If you close your eyes and cup your ears to the 2000 Tiger, you think, Wait, THIS is the guy who rules the world?

2. I’d forgotten that this was a Monday finish. Another wet week at the AT&T. That’s how it always used to seem to be. Not long after came an extended drought here in Northern California, which made a lot of us who live here wonder if it would ever rain again. It rained again last year, at the 2019 AT&T, when Phil Mickelson won on Monday at Pebble. It was the first Monday finish in the event since 2000. But I digress. Point is, it was not your regularly scheduled programming . I don’t have the TV ratings handy, but I wonder how many fans who’d watched on Sunday wound up missing out on this historic close.

3. And dang, what a close. Woods was five back to start the day and seven behind as he made the turn. His run really starts on 12, where he stuffs his tee shot to a pin tucked left on that long par-3. Yes, the conditions were spongy, but watch how softly Tiger’s ball lands there, on a slender tongue of the putting surface. If you’ve played that hole, you know how ridiculously tough that shot is for most mortals. But that was Tiger. Making the implausible look routine.

4. And then, of course, there’s the hole-out for eagle on the par-4 15th. 97 yards, with a wedge. A thunderbolt, electrifying TV. Re-watching it, I got a kick out of hearing the call from then-CBS commentator Bobby Clampett, who grew up on the Monterey Peninsula and had once been seen as the can’t-miss kid. With Tiger’s ball in the air, Clampett says he likes the club selection, and then, his voice rising, that he likes the shot. As the ball drops, Clampett punctuates the moment with a nice minimalist ‘Oh!’—a restrained call, straight out of the Frank Chirkinian school.

5. Tiger has a lot of special gifts, but in those days, one of his greatest X-Men powers was his ability to make everyone fold around him, even if they weren’t in his immediate orbit. You get a glimpse of this in the YouTube clips. No sooner has Tiger holed out for eagle on 15 than we cut to leader Matt Gogel botching a drive, and Vijay Singh leaving one in the bunker. Tiger was paired with Jim Furyk that day. We get a flash of Furyk’s name on the back of his caddie’s jumper, but otherwise, he’s nowhere to be seen. In addition to making them fall apart, Tiger had a way of turning his playing partners invisible, too.

6. Tiger entered this event having won five in a row. Five in a row! Soon to be six. The record winning streak in PGA Tour history belongs to Byron Nelson, with 11. That was in 1945. Ben Hogan won six straight in 1948. But extended win streaks simply don’t happen in the modern game. Aside from Tiger’s. In 2006-07, it’s worth remembering, he reeled off seven in a row.

7. So, Tiger jars his approach for eagle on the par-15th, and then, on the next hole, also a par-4, he nearly repeats the feat. As his ball is in the air, Peter Kostis — another broadcaster no longer on the CBS team — says that the shot sounded heavy. Um. Guess not. A nano-second later, the ball nearly drops in the cup.

8. Pebble itself plays so differently depending on the time of year. Winter and summer are polar opposites. It’s not just the wet and soft conditions turning firm and dry. The prevailing wind flip-flops, coming from the south in winter and the north in the summer. That’s something that comes into clear relief in years when the course also hosts the U.S. Open. 2000 was just that sort of year. And we know who won that one as well, in record fashion, on a Pebble that was playing very differently. Anyway, I was reminded of the winter winds while watching Tiger play 18 in the AT&T. Driver, long iron to just in front of the green. In the summer, when the wind is up, you don’t usually see guys playing the 18th that way. Not even guys like Tiger.

9. Speaking of the 18th, Tiger’s drive on that hole hugged the coastline on the left. It was an aggressive line, very risky. If it were almost any other player at almost any other time, you’d have to figure that he pulled it. But this was peak-Tiger, at a moment in a tournament when it mattered most. So you got to figure he hit it exactly where he was aiming.

10. So Matt Gogel, then a rookie, was going for his first PGA Tour win, but he stumbled home in 40 and lost to Woods by two. Crushing, right? But to Gogel’s credit, he wins this very event two years later. Nice bounce-back. I mention Gogel here because in the YouTube clip, they show two views simultaneously as Gogel is putting out on 18, with Tiger looking on from a split screen. When his win becomes official, Tiger celebrates in a three-way hug with two other guys who were in his inner-circle but no more: Stevie Williams and Butch Harmon. Our colleague Michael Bamberger just published an excellent book called The Second Life of Tiger Woods. Given all that Woods has been through, that celebration at Pebble in 2000 seems like many lives ago.

Jim Steele/What’s Natural





In 2019, bird researchers published “Decline of the North American Avifauna,” reporting a decline in 57 percent of the bird species. They estimated a net loss of nearly 2.9 billion birds since 1970, and urged us to remedy the threats, claiming all were “exacerbated by climate change”, so we can stave off the “potential collapse of the continental avifauna.” Having professionally studied bird populations for over 20 years and restored their habitat, looking at their data suggests a far more optimistic perspective.



First, consider since 1970 many species previously considered endangered such as pelicans, bald eagle, peregrine falcon, trumpeter swan, and whooping crane have been increasing due to enlightened management. Despite being hunted, ducks and geese increased by 54 percent. Secondly, just 12 of the 303 declining species account for the loss of 1.4 billion birds, and counterintuitively their decline is not worrisome.



Three introduced species – house sparrows, starlings and pigeons – account for nearly one half billion lost birds. These birds were pre-adapted to human habitat and are considered pests that carry disease and tarnish buildings and cars with their droppings. Across America, companies like Bird-B-Gone are hired to remove these foreign bird pests. Furthermore, starlings compete with native birds like bluebirds and flickers for nesting cavities, contributing to native bird declines. The removal of starlings is not an omen of an “avifauna collapse”, but good news for native birds.



When European colonists cleared forests to create pastures and farmland or provide wood for heating, open-habitat species “unnaturally” increased. Previously confined to the Great Plains, brownheaded cowbirds quickly invaded the newly opened habitat. Unfortunately, cowbirds parasitize other species by laying their eggs in their nests. A cowbird hatchling then pushes out all other nestlings, killing the parasitized species’ next generation. The loss of 40 million cowbirds only benefits our “continental avifauna”.



Several bird species had evolved to colonize forest openings naturally produced by fire, or floods or high winds. Those species “unnaturally” boomed when 50 percent to 80 percent of northeastern United States became de-forested by 1900. Still, eastern trees will reclaim a forest opening within 20 years, so open habitat species require a constant supply of forest openings. However as marginal farms and pastures were abandoned, fires were suppressed and logging reduced, forests increasingly reclaimed those openings. With a 50 percent decline in forest openings, their bird species also declined; now approaching pre-colonial numbers. Accordingly, birds of the expanding forest interior like woodpeckers are now increasing.



White-throated Sparrows and Dark-eyed Juncos quickly colonize forest openings but then disappear within a few years as the forest recovers. Those 2 species alone accounted for the loss of another quarter of a billion birds; not because of an ecosystem collapse, but because forests were reclaiming human altered habitat. Nonetheless those species are still 400 million strong, and juncos remain abundant in the open habitat maintained by suburban backyards. If environmentalists want to reclaim the abundance of their boom years, they must manage forest openings with logging or prescribed burns.



Insect outbreaks also create forest openings. For hundreds of years forests across Canada and northeastern US have been decimated every few decades by spruce bud worm eruptions. So, forest managers now spray to limit further outbreaks. Today there are an estimated 111 million living Tennessee Warblers that have specialized to feed on spruce bud worms. But the warbler’s numbers have declined by 80 million because insect outbreaks are more controlled. Still they have never been threatened with extinction. Conservationists must determine what is a reasonable warbler abundance while still protecting forests from devastating insect infestations.



The grassland biome accounted for the greatest declines, about 700 million birds. Indeed, natural grasslands had been greatly reduced by centuries of expanding agriculture and grazing. But in recent times more efficient agriculture has allowed more land to revert to “natural” states. However fossil fuel fears reversed that trend. In 2005 federal fuel policies began instituting subsidies to encourage biofuel production. As a result, 17 million more acres of grassland have been converted to corn fields for ethanol since 2006.



Although still very abundant, just 3 species account for the loss of 400 million grassland birds: Horned Larks, Savannah Sparrows and Grasshopper Sparrows. Horned Larks alone accounted for 182 million fewer birds due to a loss of very short grass habitats with some bare ground. To increase their numbers, studies show more grazing, mowing or burning will increase their preferred habitat.



It must be emphasized that the reported cumulative loss of 2.9 billion birds since 1970, does not signify ecosystem collapses. But there are some legitimate concerns such as maintaining wetlands. And there are some serious human-caused problems we need to remedy to increase struggling bird populations. It is estimated that cats kill between 1 to 3 billion birds each year. Up to 1 billion birds each year die by crashing into the illusions created by window reflections. Instead of fearmongering ecosystem collapse, our avifauna would best be served addressing those problems.

“Jiajiazai”, whose nicknamemeans“the son of Jiajia”is a six-month-oldgiant pandawho beganto meet visitors on April 25, announced the Shanghai Wild Animal Park.

In the giant panda hall, a wall has been prepared for visitors to write down their wishes to the mother and son giant panda. Screens are broadcasting video episodes of the little animal’s growth and one even live streamsthe daily life of the pandas.

According to the panda carer, Jiajiazai, whose birth weightwas185 grams, now weighs over 18 kilograms. Despite his weight he hasbecomequite lively and brave and likes climbing up and down.

Apart fromhiscaptivating character, the little animal is fairly funny. Sometimes, hestays with his mother all the day without any departure and sometimesheacts like a spoiled kid, grabbing food from his mother’s mouth and even biting her ears.

This is especially the case for the zoo's lion pride, which welcomed two new members Thursday, April 23, the zoo announced Tuesday. The new cubs were born to mother and father Kamara and Tobias, who are both four years old. ""We're seeing a lot of positive signs that things are going well, and will continue to keep a close eye on [Kamara] and the cubs in these critical first days and weeks,"" Assistant Curator of Predators Matt Lenyo said.

The births come little less than a year after the zoo welcomed another lion cub named Tatu, The Denver Post reported. Tatu is also the child of Tobias, meaning he now has two half-siblings. (Their sexes are still unknown.) His mother is Kamara's mother, Neliah, and his birth is now helping the new mom care for her own cubs. ""We are watching Kamara closely to make sure she's showing appropriate maternal behaviors, like nursing and grooming,"" Lenyo said. ""She learned a lot by watching Neliah and interacting with Tatu last year, which really prepared her to be a mom."" The cubs' birth is good news for lion conservation. African lions have decreased by fifty percent since 1994, Wildlife Conservation Network (WCN) told National Geographic. While they once roamed almost the entire African continent, they are now absent from 94 percent of their historic range and are considered vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The primary threats to their survival are loss of prey and habitat, as well as poaching.

""Lions are truly one of the world's universal icons, and they are quietly slipping away,"" WCN director of conservation programs Paul Thomson told National Geographic. The new cubs' birth is part of an effort to combat this trend. Tobias, their father, was moved to the Denver Zoo in 2018 from Buffalo in the hope that he would mate with Kamara and Neliah, the zoo said. The move was recommended by the Lion Species Survival Plan, a plan for ensuring healthy, genetically diverse lion populations in zoos belonging to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). ""Kamara and Tobias were a very genetically valuable match,"" General Curator Emily Insalaco said in the birth announcement. ""And these cubs are an important contribution to the species' population in AZA facilities, and will help inspire visitors to learn more about their wild cousins."""~[]

road tiger prey~"Roads are proliferating worldwide at an unprecedented rate, with potentially severe impacts on wildlife. We calculated the extent and potential impacts of road networks across the 1,160,000-km 2 , 13-country range of the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris)—a conservation umbrella species. We found that roads were pervasive, totaling 134,000 km across tiger conservation landscapes (TCLs), even in tiger priority sites and protected areas. Approximately 43% of the area where tiger breeding occurs and 57% of the area in TCLs fell within the road-effect zone. Consequently, current road networks may be decreasing tiger and prey abundances by more than 20%. Nearly 24,000 km of new roads will be built in TCLs by 2050, stimulated through major investment projects such as China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Given that roads will be a pervasive challenge to tiger recovery in the future, we urge decision-makers to make sustainable road development a top priority.

We calculated three metrics—road density, distance to the nearest road, and relative mean species abundance (MSA)—to characterize how road networks influence tiger habitats. We also used published forecasts of global road expansion to calculate the length of new roads that might exist in tiger habitats for each tiger range country (where projections were available) by 2050. Combined, these metrics provide starting points for range-wide monitoring and impact assessments of road development projects, thereby enabling evaluation of progress toward country-level conservation and sustainable development goals. Our preliminary risk assessment for tigers can inform future research activities and road mitigation or placement strategies at policy-relevant scales, as well as act as a template for similar studies on other road-sensitive species.

Protecting tigers is a global conservation priority, exemplified by a landmark international initiative to double global tiger numbers (called “Tx2”) from 2010 to 2022 ( 22 ). The member organizations of this initiative selected 29 priority sites from 76 tiger conservation landscapes [TCLs; blocks of tiger habitat ( 23 )] across the tiger’s range that were considered crucial for reaching the Tx2 target. In addition to TCLs and the Tx2 priority sites, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) synthesized tiger occurrence records in 2014 to produce an updated tiger range map ( 19 ). Tx2 sites, TCLs, and the IUCN range map help delineate tiger habitats and are important for rallying support for tiger conservation; however, their designation does not come with specific road or land use restrictions. In contrast, protected areas that fall within the tiger range do restrict human development to varying degrees depending on protection status and social-ecological factors ( 24 ). Spatial assessments of road networks across these various classifications are lacking, which limits tiger conservation planning.

Here, we used a recently developed global roads dataset ( 1 ) to investigate the extent and potential influence of road networks across the 1,160,000-km 2 , 13-country range of the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris). Despite being a conservation flagship species, few studies assess the impacts of roads on tigers and their recovery [e.g., ( 17 , 18 )]. In the Russian Far East, for example, roads reduce tiger survival rates due to collisions with vehicles ( 17 ). In the Kerinci Seblat region of Sumatra, tigers avoided areas closer to public roads, suggesting that roads act as important barriers to movement ( 18 ). The emerging impacts of road development on tigers are critical for several reasons. First, much of the tiger’s remaining range occurs outside protected areas where policies on road development are less stringent ( 4 , 19 ). Second, tigers are found mostly in South and Southeast Asia, which will experience accelerating pressure from human development in the coming years ( 5 ). Third, road construction often catalyzes and exacerbates the three main threats to tigers—prey depletion, habitat degradation, and poaching ( 4 ). Fourth, tigers are concentrated in source populations across their geographic range, meaning that even a small amount of road construction could disproportionately affect tiger recovery by permanently isolating tiger populations from each other ( 20 , 21 ).

While roads are now ubiquitous across much of the earth, the construction of new roads will be concentrated in areas with high biodiversity value ( 2 , 5 ). In Asia alone, road length is expected to double between 2017 and 2020 ( 11 ). The Asian Development Bank estimated that about $1.5 trillion per year needs to be invested in new infrastructure projects in the Asia-Pacific region from 2016 to 2030 to meet growth projections ( 12 ). China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for example, is considered the largest infrastructure project of all time and will entail major risks to biodiversity across Asia, as well as Eurasia and parts of Africa ( 13 , 14 ). Many of these new roads and highways will likely traverse reserves or other highly biodiverse areas ( 14 ). Although roads are one of the most important impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, most “road ecology” studies have focused on localized patterns of wildlife mortality or behavior associated with road design as well as investigating the use and effectiveness of impact mitigation measures ( 15 ). While insightful, these fine-scale interactions are often site specific ( 16 ) and might fail to estimate the full extent of the impacts from roads on wildlife at broader scales. These broad scale effects are relevant to regional road development policies. Furthermore, we know little about how patterns in road construction will affect biodiversity in the coming decades.

Road networks are expanding worldwide at an unprecedented rate ( 1 – 3 ). Earth could accumulate another 3 to 4.7 million km of roads by 2050 ( 1 ). Although roads can facilitate economic development and improve human welfare, they can also have severe effects on wildlife populations by exacerbating habitat fragmentation and human disturbance ( 4 – 7 ). For example, roads affect wildlife by acting as barriers to movement and reducing gene flow, as well as through direct mortality caused by collisions with vehicles ( 8 ). Roads also increase access to remote areas, facilitating human settlement growth, natural resource extraction, and hunting and illegal harvest ( 9 ). Moreover, traffic disturbance from noise, lights, and motion reduces the quality of habitat near roads ( 10 ).

We estimated that nearly 24,000 km of new roads will be built in TCLs by year 2050, although this is an underestimate, because data from Myanmar does not exist. The estimated increase in road length and percent change in road length within TCLs varied greatly by country ( Fig. 4 ). The countries with the largest TCL area, and thus potentially the most important foci for the global tiger conservation community, have among the highest expected increases in kilometers of road length and percent change in road length (table S7). For example, India—which has more than 16% of the global TCL area—is expected to add by far the greatest amount of roads in TCLs (14,500 km), which is a 32% increase from current levels. Although Nepal and Bhutan have less total TCL area compared to several other countries, they are expected to add 43% (880 km) and 40% (609 km) more kilometers of roads, respectively, over the next three decades.

Map (top left) showing the four occurrence categories referenced in the 2014 IUCN tiger range estimates. Top right shows the proportion of each occurrence category with different levels of MSA. The MSA levels were the same as those in ( 56 ) to aid comparison. MSA ranges from 0 to 1, with lower values indicating a larger reduction in mammal abundance due to nearby roads. MSA levels <0.95 are considered influenced by roads, and levels <0.5 are considered heavily affected. We used MSA as a proxy estimate of road impacts on tigers and their prey. Bottom panels show MSA values (500 m by 500 m, color corresponds to MSA level in the top right panel) for four TCLs spanning the different IUCN occurrence categories. The four TCLs are designated Tx2 priority sites, and their location is indicated by the numbers in the top left panel.

On the basis of relative MSA values, we predicted that roads in tiger habitat have reduced mammal abundances by ~20% compared to what would be expected if roads did not occur in tiger habitat. This suggests that roads have decreased the abundances of tigers and the species that tigers rely on directly for prey. More than half (54%) of the tiger’s entire range mapped by IUCN in 2014 was influenced by roads, as reflected by an MSA < 0.95, and nearly 20% was heavily affected (MSA < 0.5). Moreover, roads influenced 43% of areas where tiger breeding had been detected (a crucial sign of population establishment) between 2009 and 2014. Some sites with known tiger breeding can have extensive road networks (e.g., Fig. 3 , bottom), with 14% of the total area of those sites having predicted mammal abundances less than half of those estimated in nondisturbed areas ( Fig. 3 , top right). Of additional concern is that the predicted average mammal abundance as influenced by roads was lowest in sites where tigers were detected between 2009 and 2014 (MSA = 0.76 ± 0.23) than in any another occurrence category, even compared to sites where tigers were considered to have been recently extirpated (MSA = 0.81 ± 0.22). Almost one-quarter of the area where tigers had been detected between 2009 and 2014 was heavily affected by roads (MSA < 0.5; Fig. 3 , top right).

More than half of the global supply of tiger habitat is within the road-effect zone (i.e., <5 km from nearest road), likely decreasing prey abundance and increasing levels of human-wildlife conflict and poaching. Distances from the nearest road ranged from 0 to 121 km in TCLs (Russia), with a median of 3.9 km (interquartile range = 8.1 km). However, more than half (57%) of the area in TCLs was less than 5 km from the nearest road—this is notable because this is a distance below which roads negatively affect the abundance of mammals ( 25 ). Despite having more roads overall, roads were more dispersed in Tx2 sites than in non-Tx2 sites. In Tx2 sites, the median distance to the nearest road was 4.1 km (interquartile range = 8.8 km), compared to 2.9 km (interquartile range = 6.3 km) in non-Tx2 sites (table S5). About 56 and 65% of the areas in Tx2 and non-Tx2 sites, respectively, were less than 5 km from the nearest road ( Fig. 2 ). Moreover, of all distance categories, the shortest distance category (0 to 500 m from the nearest road) was the most common for both Tx2 (14%) and non-Tx2 sites (19%; Fig. 2 ). Distances from the nearest road were generally longer in protected portions of the TCLs compared to nonprotected portions. In protected portions of TCLs, the nearest road was, on average, 9.5 km away from any given location, whereas this distance was 8.4 km in nonprotected portions. There was a substantial portion (44%) of the protected areas of TCLs that were less than 5 km from the nearest road ( Fig. 2 ), but this was much less than that of nonprotected portions (61%).

Road densities also varied widely within countries ( Fig. 1 ). For example, road densities in Indonesia ranged from the third highest of all TCLs (444 m/km 2 , Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape) to the second lowest (17 m/km 2 , Bukit Balai Rejang–Selatan; table S4 and fig. S1). Average road density within the 76 TCLs was 184 m/km 2 , ranging from a low of 13 m/km 2 in Xe Bang Nouan in Laos to a high of 628 m/km 2 in Rajaji Major in India. Of the 10 TCLs with the highest road densities, 2 are considered global priorities (Corbett-Sonanadi, Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape) and two are regional priorities for tigers (Panna East, Radhanagari). Road densities were also almost 25% greater in Tx2 (209 m/km 2 ) than non-Tx2 sites (168 m/km 2 ; table S4), suggesting that roads will be a pervasive challenge to tiger recovery in those priority areas.

Road densities varied widely across tiger range countries ( Fig. 1 and table S1). For example, China’s mean road density in TCLs (274 m/km 2 ) was nearly eight times greater than that in Malaysia (35 m/km 2 ). Road densities were, on average, 34% greater in nonprotected portions (154 m/km 2 ) of TCLs than the strictly protected areas inside TCLs (115 m/km 2 ), indicating that road density increased with the relaxation of protection status (tables S2 and S3). This was not the case in Cambodia, Malaysia, and Russia where road densities were actually higher in protected areas than outside them and in India where densities were about the same ( Fig. 1 ). Note also that Bangladesh, China, and Laos have no strict protected areas in their TCLs. Furthermore, the road densities in the protected areas of TCLs of some countries were higher than those in the nonprotected areas of TCLs in neighboring countries (tables S2 and S3). Mean road densities in the protected areas in Nepal’s TCLs (168 m/km 2 ), for example, were two times greater than the nonprotected portions of TCLs (84 m/km 2 ) in Bhutan. The difference was almost three times as great between Thailand (117 m/km 2 ) and Malaysia (40 m/km 2 ).

DISCUSSION

Our analysis demonstrates that tigers face a ubiquitous and mounting threat from road networks across much of their 13-country range. In terms of road density, TCLs varied considerably by protection status and country. In particular, road densities were higher in nonprotected areas of TCLs compared to protected areas, suggesting that protected areas are limiting growth of road networks in TCLs. These protected areas in TCLs are important, because they support tiger “source” populations that can disperse and repopulate larger landscapes (26). However, the relatively high road densities outside protected areas pose a considerable challenge to long-term tiger conservation. Regional road policies may be creating tiger “islands,” whereby tiger source populations are becoming increasingly isolated from each other. Tiger dispersal and population expansion into the nonprotected forests connecting those populations are necessary to ensure that the global tiger population has opportunities to grow (27). Even protected areas were not immune to road development, with those in the TCLs in India having the greatest density than any other tiger range country. Likewise, road encroachment into areas where tigers have been recently detected (2009–2014) is already pervasive and even greater than places where tiger presence is unknown or unlikely. Tiger habitats have declined by more than 40% since 2006 (19), underscoring the importance of maintaining roadless areas and resisting road expansion in places where tigers still exist before it is too late. Doing so can create opportunities for populations of tigers and their prey to make significant recoveries (28). Considered an umbrella species (29), protecting tigers from road impacts will also promote conservation of many other threatened species and some of the world’s greatest biodiversity hot spots.

Slowing road development in the tiger range is a pressing need. Our findings suggest that the 134,000 km of roads in the tiger’s current range may be decreasing abundances of tigers and their prey by more than 20%. Roads can affect tiger abundances via several mechanisms. In India, for example, increasing vehicular traffic is likely increasing direct mortality of tigers and their prey due to vehicle collisions (30, 31). Recent reports indicate that 10 tigers have died from vehicle collisions in India from 2015 to 2017 (32), although this number is likely an underestimate due to nondetection or nonreporting. Moreover, a simulation study in Central India found that tiger extinction risk rose steeply (through genetic isolation) when traffic volume increased on roads (33). Growth in road networks can also be associated with large-scale habitat degradation and thereby decrease the carrying capacity for tigers in landscapes altered by roads. For example, the Bukit Tigapuluh Landscape, which had one of the highest road densities in our analysis, lost nearly 40 km2 of forest from 2000 to 2012 largely due to expansion of palm oil plantations. Adult tigers in that landscape decreased from 36 to 22 over that same time period (34). Beyond land transformation, incursion of low-density, low traffic volume logging roads can increase human access to remote forests and exacerbate hunting and poaching pressure on tigers and their prey for years after road construction (35, 36). These “secondary effects” of roads on wildlife, therefore, extend far beyond the road corridor per se (37). Evidence of these secondary effects occurred in Russia where tiger prey species were negatively correlated with road density and tiger survivorship and reproduction were higher in roadless areas than areas with primary or secondary roads due largely to road-facilitated poaching (38, 39). In addition, construction of roads or railways in key wildlife corridors can fragment tiger habitats, especially in bottlenecks where tigers have very limited options for movement (40). Nepal, for example, is set to build 18,000 km of new roads by 2050 (1). Many of these roads are expected to cut through narrow forest tracts in the tiger-occupied lowlands, which could seriously jeopardize the gradual recovery of tigers in the country (27).

The rush to build major new roads throughout forested regions of South and Southeast Asia, financed through China’s BRI, could have severe impacts on tigers (41). As signatories on the Convention on Biological Diversity, all tiger range countries have legally binding responsibilities to create legislation that minimizes harm to threatened species including tigers (42). The BRI could be an important partner in that endeavor by adopting biodiversity conservation as one of its core values and learning from and supporting national-level conservation initiatives. That would set the stage for the BRI to plan and implement a network of protected areas and wildlife corridors that help meet, or exceed, the Convention on Biological Diversity’s targets for protection and safeguard tigers from the impacts of roads (13). The creation of bilateral agreements that include provisions for reducing wildlife poaching and trafficking between China and countries that are part of the BRI would also lessen the impacts of that infrastructure initiative on tigers and other species of conservation concern (8). Another policy to minimize road impacts on tigers and other wildlife would be to require Chinese-funded BRI efforts overseas to ascribe to the same strict environmental regulations on road development that now exist within Chinese borders (14). Likewise, national bodies and international funding agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank and World Bank, should mandate international oversight and standards on environmental impact assessments (14).

Our results highlight the need to make sustainable road development a top priority. Smart green infrastructure can promote tiger-friendly road projects by avoiding tiger habitats, minimizing and mitigating adverse impacts through design that accounts for consequences on tigers, and compensating for damages to tiger habitats to ensure net positive impacts (42). These strategies are part of the “mitigation hierarchy,” which provides a template for minimizing environmental harm through policy recommendations at national, sectoral, and project levels. For example, the first filter is to prohibit road development or other infrastructure from priority tiger populations or those areas identified as “no go” zones in national tiger action plans or other legislation. Upgrading existing roads, for example, paving a bulldozed track, should also be avoided in or near tiger priority areas, as those roads increase access to remote forests and might increase the likelihood of vehicle collisions with tigers and their prey (43). In places where roads are being planned, strategic environmental assessments can identify methods for reducing cumulative impacts, such as zoning around infrastructure to prevent settlement growth and clearance of forest cover. Crucially, environmental impact assessments should include secondary effects on tigers and meaningfully consult with stakeholders (including local communities where roads will be developed) before project approval (43). Biodiversity offsets financed through various mechanisms—e.g., tax and subsidy shifts, protected area transfer funding, and payments of ecosystem services—can also minimize adverse impacts of road projects on tiger habitats (5, 42). However, offsets should not be misused and compromise existing international agreements on the protection of biodiversity (44). Although most of the national-level tiger action plans mention the impacts of roads, mainstreaming smart green infrastructure design principles into the plans would provide concrete ways of understanding, monitoring, and mitigating the effects of road development on tigers. More details and recommendations on developing tiger-friendly transportation infrastructure are available in Quintero et al. (42) and in table S9.

Our metrics provide tools to support sustainable road development. For example, the estimates of road density can be used to classify regions according to their magnitude of road networks. These classifications can then be used to map areas unaffected by roads (i.e., roadless areas), which could be explored as “controls” for future studies. Distance from the nearest roads can be used to geographically define zones of influence within regions to target conservation action. Within the zones of influence, the cell-by-cell estimates of MSA highlights where road impacts on tigers and their prey are potentially (or could be) most pronounced. Combined, these metrics enable rapid risk assessment and can help identify no-go zones for road infrastructure. Identifying no-go zones will be especially useful for those countries where we projected high levels of future road encroachment into tiger habitats, such as in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. Our spatial predictions of risk also allow screening of proposed road developments before decisions on road design, site, and construction preparation have already been made. This is important, as once those decisions have been made, impact assessments are too late to influence road planning (42). Our methodology can also provide baseline data to target locations for different conservation strategies, such as alternative road alignments to avoid key tiger habitats, road bundling, closure of vehicular traffic at night, decommissioning existing roads from tiger landscapes with source populations, road signage indicating the presence of tigers, and construction of wildlife crossing structures to maximize connectivity (45). Targeted road mitigation measures can, for example, support reintroduction efforts of tigers to places they have recently become functionally extinct, such as in Cambodia and Vietnam (46).

Our analysis is only a first step toward understanding and managing road encroachment into tiger habitats. Several avenues of research are needed to improve understanding. For example, how do roads alter tiger movements, hunting success, and mating? How do changes in those fitness-related behaviors translate to population-level effects? What are cost-effective methods for designing wildlife crossings that are most likely to encourage tiger movement over transportation infrastructure and maintain connectivity? Care is also needed to account for local contexts and variation in both space and time. For example, some areas might have relatively high tiger densities despite high road densities (e.g., Corbett National Park, India) because land clearing and road development occurred in the past and tiger numbers have since rebounded. In those cases, tigers may be capable of adapting to road impacts, although the conditions (e.g., low vehicle traffic) that enable tigers to cope with roads need to be better understood. In other cases, recent road development can drive declines in tigers and their prey, regardless of the current road density in the landscape (47). Furthermore, road development may create an extinction debt, in which there is a time lag between road construction and declines in tiger populations (48), necessitating long-term monitoring of tigers.

To our knowledge, fine-scale spatial data on abundances of tigers and their prey across gradients of road densities do not exist. Therefore, we used MSA as a proxy estimate of road impact on the abundances of tigers and their prey. The mammal datasets used in the meta-analysis were largely of European or North American species and biased toward carnivores and ungulates, comprising 16.3 and 58.1% of the data, respectively (25). We consider calculation of the MSA values to be a suitable first step in assessing road impacts on tigers across their range for the following three reasons. First, tiger abundances are tightly linked to ungulate prey abundances (49, 50). Second, tiger occupancy and habitat use have been shown to be negatively affected by roads (39, 51–53). Third, previous studies in Southeast Asia, although scarce, show negative relationships between roads and ungulate habitat use (54). Collecting more data on road effects on Asian wildlife species is needed to give us more accurate information for a region undergoing rapid change. In addition, our analysis treated all road types as having the same effect on abundances, which is largely appropriate, as most of the roads in the TCLs were considered “tertiary” roads (e.g., roads connecting villages or unpaved rural roads; table S8). However, larger roads, and especially unfenced highways, can act as population sinks for both tigers and their prey due to elevated human-caused mortality. Note that the global roads dataset we used, although the most complete to date, likely does not include every road within TCLs. Our findings, therefore, are conservative estimates of the true scope of the pervasive influence of roads on tigers and their prey."~[]

Good news for the lion, though. By Friday afternoon, it got a new mask like the one the other lion nearby is wearing. But to make it tougher for thieves to steal them, the new mask and the one on the other lion are now held on with cables that are a lot tougher to cut.

Police are investigating the theft and are looking for two men whom a security guard saw get out of a black Chevrolet, climb onto one of the statutes and cut the mask from the lion's head.

The large-scale masks were installed early Thursday to remind people to follow a statewide mandate that started Friday requiring people to wear masks in public places during the coronavirus crisis. The Picasso statue in nearby Daley Plaza is also wearing one.

The lions are used to wearing headgear. They sported Cubs caps in 2016 when the team won the World Series and Bears helmets twice before the team's two trips to the Super Bowl."~[]

But the threat posed by the virus to Malaika, who was rescued by the Limbe Wildlife Centre 15 years ago when someone tried to sell her as a pet, goes well beyond actual infection. The centre, home to hundreds of gorillas, chimpanzees and other primates, has seen half its revenues evaporate in recent months with park visits cancelled and cash-strapped donors in the U.S. and Europe freezing their contributions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Without a resumption of funding within the next three months, the centre, a partnership between the Cameroonian government and an international foundation, could be forced to close its doors, said Guillaume Le Flohic, the park manager.~[]

He is being rehabilitated at a Wildlife Center, and once he is older, he will be integrated into a troop and released back into the wild.

He may look adorable, but he is a real trouble-maker! Hyperactive and curious, he never stops! Everything is a game to him! Here you can see him trying to steal a pen from his caretaker pocket, after being weighed. He soon realized he wouldn't be able to get it, though, and gave up.

The Blue Monkey (Cercopithecus mitis), also known as Samango, belongs to the Cercopithecidae family of Old World Monkeys, the largest of all primate families, comprising 138 species of primates. The family includes the mandrill, drill, baboons, colobus, macaques, among many others. The genus Cercopithecus, generally referred to as Guenons, comprises 26 species, and 17 subspecies of Blue Monkey are recognized: Cercopithecus mitis opisthostictus, Cercopithecus mitis boutourlinii, Cercopithecus mitis albogularis, Cercopithecus mitis albotorquatus, Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni, Cercopithecus mitis doggetti, Cercopithecus mitis moloneyi, Cercopithecus mitis heymansi, Cercopithecus mitis erythrarchus, Cercopithecus mitis zammaronoi, Cercopithecus mitis kolbi, Cercopithecus mitis monoides, Cercopithecus mitis mitis, Cercopithecus mitis kandti, Cercopithecus mitis francescae, Cercopithecus mitis schoutedeni and Cercopithecus mitis labiatus.

This species is widespread across Central, Southern and East Africa. It can be found in many different types of forest, such as lowland and montane tropical moist forest, riverine and gallery forest, delta forest, bamboo forest, sand forest, and even secondary forest, logged forest and thickets.

Blue Monkeys are diurnal and arboreal, and live in groups of up to 40 individuals. They may form alliances with other monkey species, for added protection.

They are mostly frugivorous and folivorous, so their diet consists mostly of fruits and leaves, but they also feed on slugs and worms.

In spite of being widespread, this species suffers from habitat loss and hunting."~[]

DJ Chantel Jeffries mentioned tigers in the caption of the Instagram upload that she shared on Saturday, but she didn’t pose with one of the big striped cats for her latest stunning photo shoot. Instead, she enlisted the help of her much smaller pet feline, Miso, while promoting a bikini with a wild cat-inspired print.

Chantel was pictured rocking an eye-catching two-piece swimsuit from Monday Swimwear, the popular line of bathing suits created by Instagram models Natasha Oakley and Devin Brugman. Chantel’s bikini featured a jaguar print in shades of tan and black. The spotted pattern was photo-realistic, almost making it appear as though it was constructed out of real fur.

Chantel’s bikini top featured thin spaghetti straps, underwire, top-stitching details, and molded demi cups that put her ample assets on full display. Her matching bottoms had a high-leg cut, a mid-rise waist, and moderately-sized sides. The garment showcased Chantel’s slender hips and shapely thighs. The model was also flaunting her flat, sculpted stomach.

The musician accessorized her swimsuit with a gold treble clef pendant necklace and a delicate charm necklace.

Chantel was wearing her dark blond hair down with a natural wave. For her beauty look, she rocked an earthy pink color on her plump pout. Her shimmery eye shadow was a pale pink hue, and her eyelashes were coated with just a smidgen of dark mascara. She was also wearing peach blush on her sculpted cheeks, and she was rocking a bold dark brow. Chantel’s flawless bronze skin had an allover glow.

Chantel chose to model her wild bikini in front of a dark jungle-green wall. The spiny tips of a large agave plant’s succulent leaves were visible in the right corner of her photo. She was posing with her left leg crossed in front of her right leg. Her left arm was hanging down at her side, and she was holding her large snow Bengal, Miso, in the crook of her right arm. The feline was intently staring at something to the right of the camera. Miso’s snow-white fur with gray spots popped against the dark wall and Chantel’s tan skin.

Since it was initially posted, Chantel’s photo has received more than 300,000 likes and 1,000 comments. Many of her fans referenced the hit Netflix docuseries Tiger King in their responses to the model’s picture and caption, with a few commenters jokingly referring to her as “Chantel Baskin.”

“You can lock me up and put me in prison. Call me Joe Exotic,” read one response to her post.

“Carole baskin comin for Chantel next,” another fan wrote.

The model’s photogenic feline also received a lot of love.

“Miso looks so godly in here,” one admirer remarked.

Chantel doesn’t just model bikinis. As reported by The Inquisitr, her fans also went wild over photos of the gorgeous DJ rocking lingerie from Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty lingerie line."~[]

attention to the fate of captive tigers. The Netflix series, watched by more than 60 million households, tells a sordid tale against the backdrop of private zoos and sanctuaries that house big cats. It also provides an opportunity to educate viewers who want to learn more about tigers in captivity and the wild, according to Elizabeth Hadly, the Paul S. and Billie Achilles Professor in Environmental Biology in Stanford’s School of Humanities and Sciences, and Ellie Armstrong, a PhD student in Hadly’s lab.

Hadly and Armstrong have done extensive genetic research on wild and captive tigers. Below, they discuss the problems with private ownership of tigers, pending legislation to curb the practice, how captive tigers can contribute to conservation of wild tigers and more.

What might the average person, including fans of Tiger King, be surprised to know about captive tigers in the U.S. and around the world?

Armstrong: I think the most surprising aspect is that “tiger farming” or mass breeding, which has mostly been alleged to occur outside of the U.S. is occurring here as well. This is what results in such a high number of captive cats – estimated at more than 7,000 – within our borders. This impedes our ability to conserve wild species because when we try to tell other countries what they should do with their captive cats, we look like hypocrites. It also impedes our ability to influence the rules and regulations that are developed globally to protect wildlife.

Hadly: In spite of the conservation messages that they tout, very few private tiger facilities in the U.S. actively contribute to the restoration or conservation of wild animals. Breeding—and then rearing—an animal to adulthood in a facility that has few of the environmental conditions of their native range means that viable reintroductions have low chances of success. Indeed, the purpose of these facilities is primarily to make money for the owners of the animals—not for conservation of the species.

What does the state of tiger populations and captive breeding mean for genetic diversity and related issues?

Armstrong: Our upcoming work aims to answer that question. We have sequenced over 100 genomes of captive cats, many of whom were rescued from private facilities that purchased them from the likes of Joe Exotic. We are using this data to investigate how diversity is partitioned across the cats. We also included public zoo tigers to look at how these populations are structured.

Hadly: Genetic diversity is an important part of the long-term survival of species. However, diversity is a complicated metric alone. How the diversity is distributed within and among populations of tigers is critical, and whether the particular genotypes are selected for particular environments is also important. We are just beginning to scratch the surface of this question for tigers in the wild and in captivity.

What should be done with captive tigers? Can they contribute to conservation in the wild?

Armstrong: I think from an animal welfare perspective, we should aim to shut down facilities that are still breeding, and allow the remaining animals to live out their lives in dignity. Captive populations present an excellent opportunity to study animals that we would not otherwise have. I think they can contribute to conservation through basic research and possibly through genetic reserves. The San Diego Zoo has a reserve that has been biobanking samples from endangered species with the goal to preserve our knowledge of diversity. We can then use that data to understand how humans have impacted diversity, or for more ambitious projects such as creating stem cells to try and support the near-extinct northern white rhino population.

Hadly: The first thing to note is that none of these animals ever return to the wild. Some lineages of tigers in the U.S. have been out of the wild for nearly a century. There are so many issues to consider when re-integrating a captive animal with their wild cousins. These animals have none of the behaviors that are key to survival in the wild, they have not been exposed to their native prey, have not learned to hunt or find mates, and—quite the contrary—they may even have been selected by breeders to be more docile, less picky about food, and more tolerant of cages, concrete and people. Even if we were to surmount these challenges and successfully ‘teach’ these animals how to survive in the wild, we are severely limited by the remaining wild areas in Asia that could house tigers—less than 7 percent of their historic range. The rest is filled with humans, or has been converted to grow our food.

What might Tiger King fans be surprised to learn about Joe Exotic and his Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma or his nemesis, Carole Baskin, of Big Cat Rescue in Florida?

Armstrong: Well, I guess the first is that Tiger King is extremely misleading. Carole runs an excellent facility which is certified both by the Global Federation of Animal Sanctuaries and the organization we work with, Tigers in America. Her animals have very large enclosures and receive top of the line vet care.

Also, the show is missing history. Ten years ago, even accredited zoos and sanctuaries were doing things that we would gawk at today, such as going in for direct contact with the cats. Joe Exotic and others have refused to adopt what we now consider to be safe standards – such as no contact and no breeding, large enclosures, home for life.

The ""Big Cat Public Safety Act"" would ban the private ownership of numerous large feline species such as lions, tigers and jaguars and restrict practices such as cub petting. Why has it languished in Congress for years?

Armstrong: Some very powerful entities have lobbied against many of these proposed changes. This includes all the old circus powers. What they wanted to do with their cats directly opposed the measures in this act. The second is the argument that it impedes small business owners, which has been the argument made by a number of individuals at the local level. Also, agriculture has a stake in this as it can be viewed as a slippery slope. If you can’t breed exotics privately, what will get regulated next? Sheep? Cows? Pigs?

We are hopeful that the bill will pass, as the focus has shifted from strong regulations against private ownership to handling. We hope that this will restrict income through cub petting to many of these facilities and thus decrease the ownership in general. We took a big step this year and the bill has garnered increased support from both parties in addition to getting an okay from the Congressional Budget Office. We are now waiting for it to be scheduled for hearings on the floor of House of Representatives.

Why is it okay for public zoos to keep tigers, but not private facilities?

Armstrong: The best explanation for this is that the breeding in these facilities deals solely with pedigreed pure-bred, meaning pure subspecies. This breeding is highly regulated. However, I think that given developments in molecular tools and modeling it would be worth reconsidering how we approach captive breeding and whether small zoo populations of large predators are useful genetic reserves for their wild counterparts.

Hadly: American Zoological Association-sanctioned facilities are governed by a set of rules for breeding of animals in their care. They keep copious, careful notes of the pedigrees of their animals when breeding them, and they try to avoid inbreeding or selecting individuals that are in poor health. The association also prioritizes the education of the public about wild animal diversity, has been helpful in raising funding for conservation of wild animals and their habitats, and has pioneered breeding and care of rare and endangered animals.

Two African lion cubs, born a month ago at Nehru Zoological Park here, came out for the first time in a ‘day crawl’.

According to Nehru Zoological Park Curator, N.Kshitija, this is the first time that the cubs came out since their birth last month.

Lovely moments of the cute cubs spending time with their mother Adhisana were captured on camera by the zoo officials. One of the photographs released by the zoo authorities shows the mother licking her cub. The cubs are also seen playing with each other.

Shutdown for more than 40 days due to coronavirus-fuelled nation-wide lockdown, the zoo brought some cheers to animal lovers with the increase in the big cat population.

The Nehru Zoological Park (NZP), most popular and one of the largest zoos in the country, saw the birth of three Royal Bengal tiger cubs and two African lion cubs in the first week of April. Six jackal puppies and two Blue Gold Macaw chicks were also born.

Meanwhile, NZP officials said they were taking all precautions for the safety of the animals in the wake of the outbreak of Covid-19.

It sounded an alert last month after a tiger at a New York Zoo tested positive for the dreaded virus.

The animal keepers and veterinary staff were alerted to monitor the animals, particularly tiger and primates for checking any symptoms of cold, nasal discharge or any symptoms of flu.

The officials said the precautionary measures were taken up as per the instructions of Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Central Zoo Authority (CZA).

The veterinary wing is continuously monitoring the health of animals and checking for any symptoms.

Thermal scanning is being done of about 150 Zoo employees engaged in taking care of the animals.

The Zoo authorities took several preventive prophylactic measures since the first week of March.

The NZP, which is shut since March 22, is using the services of staff animal keepers, gardeners, security and workshop staff to attend duties for providing feed to the animals, cleaning the enclosures, maintaining hygiene and sanitation, maintaining health of animals and attending emergency maintenance works and services.

Set up in 1963, the NZP is the most popular and one of the largest Zoos with an average of 27-30 lakh visitors annually. It has over 155 species and 1550 specimens in spacious enclosures."~[]

researcher whose work covered ensure accuracy~"Study traces the evolution of extinct and living lions through genes and provides hints for conservation.

Disney’s 1994 animated film, The Lion King, immortalised the character Simba, a young lion cub, and intrigued many into the lives of lions—majestic cats now restricted to only parts of Africa and India. It may be a surprise to learn that, not long ago, they were found all over the world! About fifteen thousand years ago, the cave lions of Eurasia, the American lions of North America, the Barbary lions of North Africa, the Cape lions of South Africa, along with today’s lions, roamed the planet. Their extinction started with the cave lions about 14,000 years ago. In the last 150 years, humans have wiped off the Barbary lions and the Cape lions, hunting them to extinction.

Today, a curious question in science is to know how these different types of lions evolved and how different are today’s lions from their ancestors. In a new study, an international team of researchers have tried to answer these questions by analysing the genes of extinct and living lions. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), finds that about 500,000 years ago, modern and now-extinct lions shared a common ancestor. Further, about 70,000 years ago, two different lineages of modern lions emerged. The findings also have implications on the conservation of the remaining lion population, which is just 10% of what it was a century ago.

“Lions are absolutely a keystone species, and the health of lions generally reflects the health of the total ecosystem,” says Dr Ross Barnett from the University of Copenhagen, Denmark. An author of the present study, he has worked on cat genetics for years. “Studying lions gives us an excellent ‘big picture’ of general trends,” he adds.

Most previous studies on understanding the evolution of lions used mitochondrial DNA that is present in the mitochondria of the cell and has limited information. In the current study, the researchers have used the complete DNA sequence, extracted from 30,000-year-old fossil samples, century-old samples and live individuals. These included the cave lions (Panthera leo spelaea), and modern lions (Panthera leo leo) found in Africa and India.

“We looked at it from the whole genome angle. This allows us to get not only a robust answer on how the different populations of lions relate but also study the diversity in the remaining populations,” says Dr Thomas Gilbert. He is a professor at the University of Copenhagen and a co-author of the study. “The new results illustrate the power of the genomics in revealing lost secrets of prehistory by reading the DNA footprints of ancient and modern species,” says another co-author Dr Stephen J. O’Brien from Nova Southeastern University, USA.

The study found that until about half a million years ago, the cave lions, which lived in cold regions, and the modern lions, shared a common ancestor. This finding is consistent with other fossil evidence. Any evidence of a hybrid between cave lions and modern lions seemed to be absent. The modern lions split up into two distinct north and south lineages about 70,000 years ago, with Africa being a ‘melting pot’ of these ancestries. The northern lineage, found north of the Sahara, includes lion populations from North Africa and West Africa. In contrast, the southern lineage includes sub-Saharan lions found in Central, East and South Africa.

Indian Lions: Genetically least diverse

Among the samples studied by the researchers were Asiatic lions from the Gir forests, the only home for wild Asiatic lions. The study, although traced the origins of Asiatic lions to the northern lineage, found that they shared a fifth of their genetic structure with the southern lineage. However, it found no evidence that these lions were recently introduced from outside India. But one of the most alarming findings of the study was how less the genetic diversity was among the Asiatic lions.

“They are well known to be very inbred as the population is tiny,” says Dr Gilbert. Their analysis found that the two samples of Indian lions were almost identical, with inbreeding as a result of dwindling numbers since the 18th century. By the 20th century, only twenty lions remained in the Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat. “The risks are that there could be both an elevation of deleterious mutations in the population, and a lack of diversity in things like the immune system-related genes,” warns Dr Gilbert.

These findings have enormous implications for the conservation of these charismatic lions across the world, and especially for the vulnerable populations in Gir.

“In theory, it might be argued that they’d be at least biologically fitter if some genetic diversity was introduced. Possibly, from one of the other related populations outside India,” explains Dr Gilbert. But scepticism galore. For one, lions in India are seen as the pride of the country and “many would not want to see them ‘polluted’ with non-Indian lineages.”

Besides, such introductions of non-native species have had worse outcomes. For example, when new wolves were introduced on Isle Royale, in the US, to conserve the native ones, the previously inbred wolf population crashed.

Genetic studies, like the one here, can also stir up conversations on conservation.

“If you want to help fix species in trouble, through management, you need to know what the population looked like originally to make informed decisions,” says Dr Gilbert. These findings help at analysing the direct impact of the last 100+ years on the species and its genome. This ability did not exist before. “For example, we see in the South African lions a very measurable loss of diversity during this time. We know humans impact the genetic diversity of species. Now, we can start quantifying it and maybe use that for future management,” signs off Dr Gilbert.

Captive populations present an excellent opportunity to study animals that we would not otherwise have. I think they can contribute to conservation through basic research and possibly through genetic reserves. The San Diego Zoo has a reserve that has been biobanking samples from endangered species with the goal to preserve our knowledge of diversity. We can then use that data to understand how humans have impacted diversity, or for more ambitious projects such as creating stem cells to try and support the near-extinct northern white rhino population.

Hadly: The first thing to note is that none of these animals ever return to the wild. Some lineages of tigers in the US have been out of the wild for nearly a century. There are so many issues to consider when re-integrating a captive animal with their wild cousins. These animals have none of the behaviors that are key to survival in the wild, they have not been exposed to their native prey, have not learned to hunt or find mates, and—quite the contrary—they may even have been selected by breeders to be more docile, less picky about food, and more tolerant of cages, concrete, and people.

Even if we were to surmount these challenges and successfully “teach” these animals how to survive in the wild, we are severely limited by the remaining wild areas in Asia that could house tigers—less than 7% of their historic range. The rest is filled with humans, or has been converted to grow our food."~['US']

In the video, a sea lion is seen jumping in and out of San Diego Bay around some people kayaking earlier this month.

One of those kayakers, Russ Plenis, owner of Eco Boat Rentals, said it was a sight he's never seen before in his time on the water.

RELATED:

""I'm kayaking very often and never saw something like this in my life,"" Plenis said. ""I saw him from the distance and slowly start to approach.""

Plenis said little did he know when he and his wife floated out near Bali Hai Restaurant that a playful sea lion would join their voyage.

""Then we were just 20 feet away, he saw us too but instead of swimming away he was super excited and started following the kayaks and jumping all around,"" Plenis said. ""I guess he was attracted by [the] bio lights from the kayaks and just was looking to play.""

RELATED:

The scene is similar to other scenes on the water as San Diego sees its strongest red tide in years.

In Newport Beach, dolphins were seen last month frolicking around a boat, creating a mesmerizing display of neon blue waves.

While the bioluminescent shows are quite the sight, local authorities are asking people to practice social distancing, wear a mask, and not to gathering at beaches amid the coronavirus pandemic."~[]

Carl Akeley, “In Brightest Africa,” 1920

Twilight in the Namibian desert, the oldest on earth, overtakes the African night like a gigantic cloak born from the beginning of time. One is transported back 55 million years. One evening we were gifted with the sight of a dozen white rhinos, the second largest terrestrial animal, running past our car, like massive warriors rushing across one of the most isolated and rapturous wildernesses in the world. The sight was hallucinatory, a pageant born from an era when rhinos ruled the world. A few minutes later the vision was matched by two males sauntering off into the distance, jousting horn to horn under the red lights of our car like two prehistoric knights kicking up dust in an antediluvian spectacle fit only for giants.

When Marco Polo visited what is now Sumatra seven centuries ago, he mentioned elephants and what he thought was a unicorn. This creature had the “feet of an elephant, the head of wild boar, and hair like a buffalo.” He underscored that it was a “very ugly beast to look at.” This species, the now very rare Sumatran rhino, number only about eighty. The Javan rhino is at less than 70 and the Indian at about 3,500. It was indeed very different from the small, mythic unicorn that was caught in the lap of the virgin back in the imagination of Medieval European civilization. It was in Southeast Asia 4,000 years ago that the image of the unicorn was born. It is because of Southeast Asia’s fixation on the rhino horn, and its apocryphal medicinal properties of curing hangovers and cancer, that has led to an outright massacre of the world’s rhino populations in Africa and Asia in recent years.

Myths about behemoths, which referred to numerous large species including the rhino, go back to the Bible. Western tradition and tales abound about the unicorn’s strength and unwillingness to be tamed. In the old days proof of the unicorn’s existence was verification of the Bible’s accuracy. In 1836 a Mr. Campbell brought a horn attached to a skull from South Africa, what he called the “Unicorns of ancients, and the same which is described in the 39thchapter of the book of Job.” Exhibited at the Museum of the Missionary Society, the legend of the unicorn spread rapidly throughout the English speaking world.

To 19th century scientists such as Swiss American Louis Agassiz, the rhino was a living cipher from prehistory and embodied a savageness and primitiveness that would, he surmised, doom it to extinction. Even Theodore Roosevelt himself fostered the perception that the rhino was an anachronism and unfit, maybe even unworthy of surviving in the modern world. Roosevelt’s son Kermit wrote, “Look at him standing there in the middle of the African plain, deep in prehistoric thought."" Theodore himself wrote, “Indeed the rhinoceros does seem like a survival from the older world that has vanished; he was in place in the Pliocene; he would not have been out of place in the Miocene; but nowadays he can only exist at all in regions that have lagged behind, while the rest of the world, for good or evil, has gone forward.”

In its dry, rapturous, often near mystical sweeping landscapes, the desert in Namibia offers a spellbinding horizon for some of the most isolated rhino sightings on the planet. We tracked white rhinos among granite boulders and red sand dunes where one can still imagine Paraceratherium, the hornless distant cousin of the rhino from 30 million years ago. At 16 feet tall and 20 tons it was the largest land mammal ever to walk the earth. We searched for rhino tracks for hours until we finally found a mother with her calf alongside a euphorbia bush several hundred meters away. The power, calm, and utter stillness of the mother guarding her calf was a vision carved out of prehistory and here rhinos were at peace with the world.

But despite having no real enemies, humans have managed to almost wipe rhinos out in the last century. There may have been 500,000 rhinos a hundred years ago and some accounts from the early 20th century mention rhinos dotting the landscape as commonly as antelopes.

One hundred fifty years ago there may have been as many as a million black and white rhinos when Stanley and Livingstone and other explorers went searching for the headwaters of the Nile. Then the 20th century arrived and rhino numbers plummeted. While there were only about 20,000 in 2009 today there are closer to 29,000 white rhinos. But while conservation measures have been remarkable with a 41 percent increase, the scale of poaching has also increased over the last decade.

In 2007, 13 rhinos were killed in South Africa. In 2009 about 120 rhinos were destroyed, a year later over 330. In 2017 it was 1,028. While ivory prices may have attained $2,000 a kilo at its peak in 2014, and has since dropped by two thirds, rhino horn has attained prices of $100,000 a kilogram, more expensive than gold, diamonds, platinum and even cocaine. Stories abound of the ruthlessness of poachers and how rhinos have had their horns hacked off while still being alive. In South Africa in 2013 poachers hacked a pregnant mother rhino with an axe presumably to paralyze her spine. She would have given birth in two months.

The scale of the destruction has been overwhelming. In 2018, 769 rhinos were destroyed but in 2019, 594 rhinos were slaughtered. Slightly encouraging as the numbers are, the battle for the rhino is far from over. Overall, about 9,000 rhinos were killed in the last decade. Increasing vigilance, greater understanding of poaching patterns, and law enforcement have helped the situation, but poachers continue targeting rhinos with chainsaws for the Vietnamese market and other Southeast Asian countries. There are hopes to be able to save the northern white rhino with in vitro fertilization from the sperm of the last male, Sudan, to have survived and the last two females still extant. We can only hope. The black rhino number stood at about 2,300 in the early 1990’s and today at more than 5,000. But when one imagines the tens of thousands that used to roam the wilderness of Africa, one can be aghast at the enormous impoverishment the wild has inherited over the last hundred years.

Criminal syndicates in Yemen and South Korea were once the main traffickers in the 1970’s. In 2010 Vietnam lost its last rhino. While the future for rhinos looks slightly better than it did five years ago, some rhino breeders who sell their horns are banking on extinction. Organized crime syndicates still see dollars on the rhino’s nose, hundreds of thousands of them.

As if humans killing rhinos were not horrific enough, there are remarkable incidents of young male elephants killing 58 black rhinos in Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park near Durban and between 1991 and 2001 49 white rhinos were killed near Pilanesberg National Park. Older male elephants had been killed off and crowded conditions of the parks created stress and disrupted normal social bonds between elephants. Lacking socialization with older elephants, as Gay Bradshaw highlighted in “Elephants on the Edge” in 2009, made the younger elephants more prone to violence. The evidence of some of these young elephants even raping rhinos is proof of how normal patterns of behavior in the wild has been turned upside down by the hand of man.

We can only hope that one day, the stigma of owning a rhino horn in the far East will sway people’s taste, just as owning a fur has become taboo in much of the West. The slow breeding magnificence of the rhino lingers on in the savannah as a massive sentinel from bygone days, a time when giants ruled the earth. Like the lions and the elephants that have been sacrificed to the altar of human pride, and bloodlust, rhinos have been targeted for the value invested in sheer superstition that has no basis in reality whatsoever. Arthritis and gout and cancer will not be cured by rhino horn powder any more than biting one's fingernails will cure diabetes.

In Africa in the 15th century, Portuguese explorers say they witnessed the unicorn. At certain angles, the two horns of a rhino will appear as one. Today a being born of seemingly prehistoric times, bonds the antediluvian past to our own time. As compared to Rataxes, the rhino nemesis of Babar in the classic children's story by Laurent de Brushoff, some locals in Namibia, in awe of the rhino, have even told stories of the rhino’s care for others, as in the times when they would watch over elephants drinking at waterholes at night, the great Excalibur on their nose pointing outwards towards the bush, guarding those near the water from any attacks from lions.

If the rhinos of Earth should be vanquished by the greed that seems to be driving our society, its horn will have become a dagger to our very standing on earth. The caves of Chauvet, France, painted 30,000 years ago, contain exquisite renditions of rhinos that graced the ground of our origins. The rhinos, their very flesh, like that of the elephants, enabled humans to survive. A century ago Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “Among living giants, it is the only one that has been considered extinct, the only one never brought alive to civilized countries.” Roosevelt's “civilized” forays in the wilds of East Africa returned with several specimens, some of which are displayed in the Akeley Hall of African Mammals at the American Museum of Natural History. The survival of the rhinos depends on human compassion, charity (Save the Rhino Trust), the continued worldwide campaigns to sway taste away from rhino horn and the fight to stop black market traffickers. The efforts of anti-poaching groups such as the all-women Black Mambas in South Africa who go through six weeks of intense training are especially remarkable. They need financial support and encourage women to join them.

My son Lysander, when he was ten, mystified by the search for rhinos in the oldest sands on earth, called the animals “the living boulders of a faraway time.” A magical description of beings of imponderable presence, whose very mass and steadfastness is that of a foundation, that not only holds some of earth‘s most awe inspiring form and stature, a time before humans started unraveling the fabric of existence, but a special handful of species that are sentinels of stalwartness, power, and fortitude desperately in need of balance in this increasingly fragile time.

around the globes online museums. Courtesy of Covid-19, the majority of major museums worldwide have shut their doors. Instead, there have been efforts to create virtual tours of their galleries and artefacts online. Maybe your primary concern at the moment is not that you can no longer wander around the Sistine chapel, but why not spend this share time learning something new from your sofa (whilst also avoiding the usual museum queues)?

There is a huge variety of museums available to browse online

There is a huge variety of museums available to browse online, ranging from the Schnitzel Museum in Vienna (which manages to spend a remarkable amount of time analysing the dish) to the Museum of Broken Relationships (featuring a bizarre range of items from peoples’ ex-partners, including a ‘toaster of vindication’). This list of five virtual museums is only scratching the surface, but hopefully it might be a starting point for your journey of cultural exploration.

1.Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid

This virtual tour is so realistic that you catch yourself wanting to visit the café. Whilst being incredibly easy to use, the virtual platform also beautifully captures the museum’s dusky pink walls and views of majestic palm trees from the windows. There are 78 different exhibitions from previous years which have been uploaded. The most recent exhibition, Rembrandt and Amsterdam portraiture, 1590-1670, is spectacular, with over 80 paintings, some of which have never been on display in Europe before. By clicking on the paintings and listening to the dulcet tones of the audio-guide, a great deal can be learnt.

By clicking on the paintings and listening to the dulcet tones of the audio-guide, a great deal can be learnt. A personal favourite is the exhibition: Balenciaga and Spanish Painting from June 2019. It features stunning designer dresses alongside equally stylish Spanish paintings from the early modern period. If you are amongst the many people whose summer holidays have been cancelled, this tour is certainly for you: soak up the (virtual) sun rays and admire the views of Madrid whilst immersing yourself in elegant European art.

2.The Vatican Museums, Rome

Experience the splendour of the Sistine Chapel and the genius of Raphael in this 360 virtual tour of some of the most visited museums in the world. Whilst this tour does not contain reels of information about the items on display, the artefacts and rooms which it features are visually fascinating themselves, meaning that it is enough to sit back and gaze in awe at the vaulted ceilings. If your intellectual appetite is not satisfied, you can study to your heart’s content the online Vatican Museums Catalogue for free. Parts of the tour include the Stanze di Raffaello, created by Raphael, and the ornate Room of Chiascuro, along with plenty of Renaissance art and Roman sculptures. With queues normally lasting between one and three hours in the heat, take this opportunity to enjoy these spectacular sights from the comfort of your home.

3. J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles

With a huge selection of art ranging from the early middle ages to the present, this interactive tour of one of the richest museums in the world is by no means modest. This tour is part of Google Arts and Culture, which not only allows you to browse sites of cultural interests, but catalogues artefacts and art. For example, the J. Paul Getty tour is accompanied by a catalogue of 15,746 items to browse for free. Looking around the museum itself is a true Hollywood experience, with several floors of glitzy, gold-gilded rooms filled to the brim with renowned artwork. The tour is quite interactive, with interesting information appearing next to some of the art and high-definition versions of the paintings available for study. So, why not listen to some vintage Hollywood jazz and admire the opulence and glamour of this impressive museum.

4. Natural History Museum, London

If you have not yet managed to see the fascinating skeletons of ‘Hope’ the Giant Blue Whale or ‘Dippy’ the Diplodocus, now is your chance. This tour, as part of Google Arts and Culture, allows you to view many of the specimens up-close, from the giant skeleton of a mammoth to the smallest species in The Hummingbird Display, accompanied by beautiful Victorian terracotta architecture. There are also an impressive 298,857 items in the catalogue and some fascinating exhibits available for viewing, including the Human Evolution exhibition. This tour is a true Night at the Museum experience, giving you the opportunity to wander alone amongst the marvels of nature (perhaps substituting the cheeky capuchin monkey of the film with your cat or dog, unfortunately).

5. National Palace Museum, Taipei City

Lose yourself in classic Chinese timberwork and wander through the Garden of Compassion and Tranquillity. This spectacular selection of virtual exhibits from the National Palace Museum, which is home to one of the largest collections of Chinese artefacts and artwork, is truly mesmerising. What makes this virtual tour so unique is that it combines views of the interior and the exterior of the museum, both of which are equally stunning. Many of the artefacts in the museum even have accompanying information in English.

The exhibition Across the Silk Road is particularly interesting, as are all the other exhibits. Nevertheless, you will have to use your imagination with the Studio of Cleansing Fragrances. Most imposingly, there is an online tour of the lantern display from outside the walls of the Forbidden City. The beautiful scenery, a fascinating range of artefacts and soothing piano music combine to form a calming tonic to the current chaos of the world.

With worrying news headlines appearing every hour on our phones, these virtual tours provide some much-needed relaxation. During lockdown, being mentally active is equally as important as physical exercise and these virtual cultural experiences will do just that. The beautiful artefacts, art and museums available for browsing are a welcome reminder that our world is still a beautiful place to be. This current period of chaos is only a brief episode in time, as demonstrated by the centuries of history on display.

The beautiful artefacts, art and museums available for browsing are a welcome reminder that our world is still a beautiful place

More generally in the arts industry, there is a pressure for the democratization of art by making it available to everyone, no matter what their socio-economic background is. These virtual tours may be the way forward: whether it be schools unable to afford class museum trips or people physically unable to travel, everyone can enjoy the wonders of history, despite the world’s significant lack of producing wonders at this time.

Mother and offspring are doing well.

The male and female cubs were born at the zoo on April 15, which currently remains closed due to the decrees relating to the coronavirus pandemic. They have yet to be named, according to the Zoo’s, Ioulios Christoforou.

“We haven’t named them yet, but we will run a competition in the coming days to choose their names. This is the first time that we haven’t had to intervene, and the mother is taking great care of them,” he told the Cyprus Mail on Wednesday.

This is the third litter for the parents, Zeus and Hera, who have been at the soo for more than eight years. They arrived from a zoo in Johannesburg in South Africa. Zoo staff had to intervene on previous occasions and those cubs were hand-reared. The pair have fared well at the facility and are friendly, happy and thriving in the Cyprus climate, said Christoforou.

Christoforou candidly admitted that a lack of footfall and distractions from around the lion enclosure most probably helped Hera to concentrate on taking care of the new cubs.

“It helps that the mother is not distracted, there is no commotion or movement and she is relaxed and isolated,” he said.

Zeus, the cubs’ father, has also been playing an important role.

“He is being very affectionate to the cubs and is taking care of them as well,” Christoforou said.

In addition, a new baby male camel was born in March, as well as monkeys, deer and ponies. A number of exotic birds are also laying eggs for the first time.

The zoo is hoping to reopen at the beginning of June and will rely on supporters, locals and residents to visit.

“We hope that people will support us as we are facing tough times due to a lack of cash flow from admission fees and it costs so much to feed all of the animals and birds each month.”

Each big cats alone costs €3,000 to feed and the zoo tried to mimic food from the wild such as beef, chicken, pork, goat, lamb and duck.

“We haven’t had to cut back on anything yet, but it’s getting tough. We are also trying to be as sustainable as possible and to cut costs,” he said.

The zoo also owns land nearby and is growing bananas, papaya, wheat, barley, straw, mango, avocado, peaches, melons, pumpkins and vegetables as well, which is all used to feed the animals and exotic birds.

However, medicines, imported insects, baby food, salaries and other overheads such as electricity, are all expensive, he said.

The facility is currently still employing 11 keepers to look after the zoo’s residents, with other staff furloughed under the government’s programme to pay 60 per cent of wages, Christoforou noted.

The first white lion cub to be born in Cyprus was just over a year ago at Paphos zoo and named Simba. He is still at the zoo and there are plans to bring a young white female lion from Africa to pair with him in the future.

Meanwhile, male lion Gio, who was also born at the zoo, will most probably be transferred abroad to another facility.

There are lots of choices available to cater to your wildlife fantasies, and whichever destination you may choose, you are more than guaranteed to have the time of your life. Now there’s so many to choose from, but here are our top picks:

Serengeti National Park, Tanzania

From hot air ballooning, romantic bush breakfast, to the Big Five game drives, your Tanzanian safari adventure begins that the Serengeti National Park. Derived from the Masai phrase “Siringet” which translates to “endless plain” or “the land that runs on forever”, the Serengeti National Park is a Tanzanian National Park in the Serengeti ecosystem in the Mara and Simiyu regions.

Known worldwide for its abundance of wildlife and high biodiversity, the Serengeti boasts over 1.5million wildebeest which constitute the largest population of big mammals that roam the planet. It is believed to have the largest population of lions in Africa plus a great ornithological interest boasting over 500 species of exotic bird species. Activities here include witnessing first hand the Great Migration, game drives, bush meals, hot air balloon safaris, private guided walks, visits to the nearby village to spend time with locals and lots more.

Masai Mara Game Reserve, Kenya

Dubbed as one of the most popular tourist destinations in Kenya and Africa, the Masai Mara Game Reserve is located in the Great Rift Valley in primarily open grasslands. The Mara is the jewel of Kenya’s wildlife viewing areas and just like its neighboring Serengeti, it hosts the annual Great Migration. There is a great chance of spotting the Big Five including the elephant, leopard, buffalo, lion, and rhino. Masai Mara Game Reserve boasts over 95 species of mammals, amphibians, and reptiles plus over 400 exotic bird species.

There are several activities in the Mara which range from luxury experiences such as Hot air balloon flights over the plains to less expensive bush meals, nature walks, or wildlife treks. Other activities include visits to the traditional Maasai villages where you witness firsthand the unique way of life of these nomadic people.

Kruger National Park, South Africa

Widely known as the first national park in South Africa, Kruger National Park more recently became part of the Greater Limpopo Frontier Park. Animals now roam freely across borders as they would have thousands of years ago as a result of an international collaboration that joins the park with Limpopo National Park in Mozambique and Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe. An ideal habitat for an astounding variety of flora and fauna, Kruger National Park’s incredible size spans a number of different ecosystems including savannah, thornveld, and woodland. In addition to the countless fish, reptiles, and amphibians, the park boasts 147 mammal species and no fewer than 507 exotic avian species. Activities in the park include self-driving, guided game drives, guided walks, wilderness trails, mountain biking, and so much more.

Okavango Delta, Botswana

Formed where the Okavango River reaches a tectonic trough in the central part of the endorheic basin of the Kalahari, Okavango Delta (formerly known as Okvongo) is a swampy inland delta. It was inscribed as one of the seven natural wonders of Africa and it is also listed as one of Unesco World Heritage Sites. In addition to the wide range of birdlife, fish, and plants, the Okavango Delta is home to a wide variety of wildlife including lechwe, African bush elephant, lion, blue wildebeest, springbok, impala, roan antelope, vervet monkey, black rhinoceros, white rhinoceros, Nile crocodile, and so much more.

Kafue National Park, Zambia

Spanning an area of about 22,400km sq, Kafue National Park is the largest National park in Zambia and the second-largest park in Africa. The Park was named after the Kafue River that stretches over three provinces. While most of the park lies with central Zambezian Miombo Woodlands, the Jewel in Kafue’s crown is the Zambezian flooded grasslands. Home to over 55 different animal species, Kafue National park boasts a superb range of antelopes, red lechwe, puku, kudus, bushbucks, elands, reedbucks, duikers, Defassa waterbuck, elephants, hippopotamus, crocodile, Cape wild dogs, and so much more.

Queen Elizabeth National Park, Uganda

Nestled in the western region of Uganda and spanning the districts of Kasese, Kamwengwe, Rubirizi, and Rukungiri, Queen Elizabeth National Park is approximately 400km by road southwest of Kampala, Uganda’s capital and largest city. The park was formerly known as Kaziranga National Park but was renamed to commemorate a visit by Queen Elizabeth II. Queen Elizabeth National Park is a combination of the Kyambura Game Reserve, the Maramagambo Forest, the Kibale National Park, and the Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Queen Elizabeth National Park is home to over 90 mammal species and 500 exotic bird species.

There you have it. Africa boasts the best safari destinations, so the only question now is which ones will you be visiting this year?

Now, one of the show's famous fans is helping give it the musical treatment.

With his brand new video ""Husband Number 2"" (premiering below), singer/actor Frankie Grande is joining the growing cast of Broadway composer Andrew Lippa's online parody series ""Tiger King: The Musical (A Parody!)"" In the video, Grande stars as Travis Maldonado, the late husband of documentary star Exotic (also played by Grande), as he begins his three-way marriage with the chaotic tiger breeder and his other partner, John Finlay (again, played by Grande).

While the video (directed by Ben Gettinger) begins with Grande's Maldonado being entranced by Exotic's fame, money, and access to guns and drugs, he quickly begins to spiral, realizing that he doesn't love the infamous zookeeper — especially since he was only one third of the relationship. ""Besides just tigers at the zoo, one man's above me/ And I don't think I'll be coming back for more,"" he belts.

The new video is the latest part of Lippa's ongoing parody musical, which kicked off with the Kristen Chenoweth-starring song ""Little Pieces,"" starring the Broadway icon as polarizing activist Carole Baskin, and followed by Phillipa Soo's ""Saff's Song,"" where the Hamilton actress portrays the one-armed G.W. Zoo staffer Saff Saffery.

Speaking to Billboard, Grande says that he knew he wanted to get involved in the project as soon as he heard Chenoweth's hilarious number. ""I immediately fell in love with the song and the project and decided to lip-sync [Chenoweth's] song for my Bathroom Talent Show series,"" he says. ""I reached out to Kristin, as she has been a long-time friend, and told her I would be performing this and she lost her mind with excitement! I shot the video, sent it to Kristin and then got a call from Andrew Lippa, who loved it! A day later he sent me the song 'Husband Number 2,' which he wrote for me.""

Jaguar is hard at work to revamp almost its entire lineup. We’ve already seen the facelifted XE and F-Type, and spy photos have confirmed development is underway for the mid-cycle refreshes of the F-Pace, E-Pace, and this - the XF. This latest batch of spy photos shows prototypes of both the saloon and estate versions of the British vehicle, spied on at different locations across mainland Europe.

A thin camouflage foil is covering both cars and is not letting us take a closer look at the design changes, which makes it hard to draw exact conclusions about the model’s updated appearance. From what we are able to see so far, however, the headlights appear to be sleeker than on the outgoing model, while the radiator grille seems smaller, too.

At the back, it’s worth mentioning that the estate prototype appears to be a diesel judging by the dual exhaust pipes pointing towards the ground, which are mounted at the driver’s side of the XF. Interestingly, there’s also a white box underneath attached to the rear suspension, which could be some sort of sensor for evaluating possible powertrain changes.

New XF spied:

Speaking of engines, word on the street is the XF and XF Sportbrake will get a family of RDE2-compliant diesel engines for the European market, which will be shared with the compression ignition units found in the facelifted XE. These cleaner and more efficient powertrains will allow the diesel-powered XF trims to remain on sale after the continent’s emissions regulation change in 2021.

In turn, the days of the XF S could be counted as it is believed Jaguar could retire the top dog in the lineup because it’s not meeting Europe’s ever-stricter emissions standards. It’ll be very interesting to see whether the facelifted XF will receive some sort of electrified powertrains but given its older platform, that seems unlikely.

outdoor recreation conditions in the Adirondacks sent out from the NYS DEC.

For the safety of all visitors and to reduce the community spread of COVID-19, DEC and State Parks are undertaking steps to reduce public density:

Closing all playgrounds, athletic courts and sporting fields until further notice;

Canceling all public programs and events at state parks, lands, forests and facilities until further notice;

Closing all indoor visitor facilities, such as nature centers, environmental education centers, visitor centers, and historic houses to the public until further notice;

Starting Saturday, April 25, golf courses operated by State Parks may open. Operating schedules will differ across the state. Call the course directly for current information; DEC is closing access to DEC-controlled fire towers to the public. Trails and the summits to the towers remain open, but the towers themselves present a potential risk with multiple people climbing the stairs, in close quarters, unable to appropriately socially distance, and using the same handrails; and

Limiting parking. State Parks may reduce the number of available parking spaces on high visitation days. Please avoid visiting crowded areas. For visitor safety and the safety of others, do not park on roadsides and only park in designated parking areas.

New Yorkers are required to wear masks in public when appropriate social distancing cannot be maintained.

Camping

Campgrounds: All DEC Campgrounds remain closed, including campsites, bathrooms, playgrounds, pavilions, picnic sites, beaches, and other day use areas and facilities. The public may enter DEC campgrounds to access trails on the Forest Preserve or to walk or bike on the campground roadways. Motor and motorized vehicles are prohibited from entering DEC campgrounds. Visit in small groups limited to immediate household members and practice social distancing.

DEC Lean-tos: Use of lean-tos should be restricted to members of a single household at a time to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Primitive Camping: DEC has temporarily stopped issuing permits for backcountry camping for groups of 10 or more, and for more than three days at one location on state lands.

DEC Boat Launches

DEC boat launches are open for recreational use by individuals and households provided strict adherence to the CDC/New York State Department of Health guidelines for preventing the spread of colds, flu, and COVID-19 is followed:

Try to keep at least six feet of distance between you and others.

Avoid close contact, such as shaking hands.

Wash hands often or use a hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available.

Avoid surfaces that are touched often, such as rails, posts, and tie off cleats.

Wear a mask when appropriate social distancing cannot be maintained.

Trailhead Registers

Trailhead registers provide vital information, so please continue to sign in and out. During the COVID-19 public health crisis, special precautions should be taken while using trailhead registers to minimize spread of the virus through commonly touched surfaces, such as pencils and the registers themselves. Follow these guidelines when using trailhead registers to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Only one person per group should register. Others in the group should stay away from the register.

If someone is at a register when you approach, stand at least six feet away and wait for them to leave before you approach.

Bring your own pencil or pen.

Minimize touching surfaces.

Carry hand sanitizer and use it immediately before and after using the register.

Don’t cough or sneeze while at the register. If you must cough or sneeze, move away from the register and hand sanitize before returning.

Adirondack Rock Climbing Route Closures

DEC has closed certain rock climbing routes in the Adirondacks to protect nesting peregrine falcons. Status of rock climbing routes:

Chapel Pond Area Upper Washbowl Cliffs – Closed Lower Washbowl Cliffs – Closed Spider’s Web – Open

The shrine is expected to be closed for about three weeks, but renovations may take longer should weather and increased visitation affect the project’s timeline.

During maintenance, the shrine will be fenced off and unavailable to public access. Crews will work to make repairs to the Symbol of Our Best’s right ear and claws and give the Lion a deep cleaning to keep it in tip-top shape.

While renovations are underway, visitors are asked to stay out of the fenced area and not make contact with workers.

As graduation rapidly approaches, Penn State is also discouraging students and their families from visiting other campus landmarks in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

Despite an increase in signage encouraging social distancing and six-foot distance markers scattered around campus, university officials have observed large congregations of folks around landmarks including the We Are sign and Old Main. Earlier this spring, social distancing measures were implemented at the Lion Shrine as well.

To help limit health risks as much as possible, Penn State encourages any visitors to properly distance themselves from others and wear face masks at all times. According to the university, failure to follow recommendations from health care experts may result in the landmarks being closed to the general public until further notice.

That characteristic is said to be due to its upturned nose, a feature distinctive to all five species of snub-nosed monkeys. All five of these species are endemic to Southeast Asia in the mountainous regions near the intersections of Myanmar, Vietnam and southern China. Yet the Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkey, despite the charming quirk of their weather-derived nasal fits, is under immense threat of extinction from habitat loss and poaching. That’s why Rainforest Trust teamed up with Fauna and Flora International (FFI) to protect habitat in northern Myanmar for the species.

The Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkey was first discovered only ten years ago by a research team led by FFI scientists. But it didn’t take long for the conservation world to determine that the species was threatened with extinction. Soon after its discovery, the species was ranked as “Critically Endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). This shouldn’t have been much of a surprise for those familiar with snub-nosed monkeys — of the other four species, IUCN lists one as “Critically Endangered” and three as “Endangered.”

Scientists believe that only around 330 individual Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkeys remain in the wild, isolated to a small corner of Myanmar. And that number is at risk of dropping even further. Habitat loss, especially from logging and road-building, threatens their forest homes. Since the species lives only in a small region of the eastern Himalayas, any forest destruction in this area is a major blow to the entire species.

But just recently, the government of Myanmar created Imawbum National Park, a 386,176-acre stretch of habitat now officially protected along the border with China. This site covers essentially the entire Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkey range and safeguards the core of their habitat.

The park also provides protection for a rare cross-section of Southeast Asian wildlife. Another local resident is the Endangered Red Panda, a small mammal related to raccoons and weasels native to this region. The Endangered Shortridge’s Langur is another threatened primate species endemic to these forests. Other resident mammals include two Critically Endangered pangolin species — the Chinese and the Sunda Pangolins — as well as the Bengal Slow Loris, Asiatic Black Bear, Sun Bear, Takin, Eastern Hoolock Gibbon, Northern Pig-tailed Macaque, Stump-tailed Macaque and the northern species of Clouded Leopard, all of which IUCN ranks as “Vulnerable” to extinction.

“This new national park will protect one of the last intact forests with this assemblage of species in Southeast Asia,” said Mark Gruin, Rainforest Trust’s VP, Strategic Initiatives. “We’re thrilled that this unique ecosystem, and its vast biodiversity, including such unique and enchanting creatures as the Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkey, will now be protected.”

Imawbum National Park will have a collaborative management strategy with patrolling, law enforcement, species conservation interventions, protected area infrastructure and awareness programs. Long-term protection efforts will emphasize community integration, making local people stakeholders in conservation efforts.

“The designation of the area is just the first step. It is now imperative that the necessary resources are directed towards the area so we can ensure the long-term survival of the snub-nosed monkey and all of the endangered species that call this forest home,” said Mark Grindley, Country Director of Fauna & Flora International’s Myanmar Program.

By protecting this wide swath of forest, Rainforest Trust and FFI have ensured that the Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkey and other local wildlife will have a place to thrive in northern Myanmar. So the next time it rains, these monkeys can finally sneeze in peace.

This protected area was established thanks in part to your support of our work and the Conservation Action Fund. A special thanks to Leslie Santos and Brett Byers, and Luanne Lemmer and Eric Veach for their leadership gifts to this project. All gifts matched by the SAVES Challenge.

Camping in the Rennell Sound Recreation Site. (Recreation Sites and Trails BC/Black Press Media files)

Rennell Sound is part of Haida Gwaii’s Duu Guusd Heritage Site/Conservancy area, located about 30 kilometres west of the communities of Old Massett and Massett.

The Rennell Sound area is the only area on on the west coast of Graham Island that is accessible by vehicle.

It is some of the richest waters on Haida Gwaii, with substantial herring spawns, massive kelp forests, fertile eel grass beds, and multiple fresh water streams that host salmon, trout, char and other fish.

Rennell Sound, the largest sound on Haida Gwaii’s west coast, has a 16-kilometre entrance and a 20-kilometre channel.

The Rennell Sound Recreation Site is a popular destination and is famed for its fishing.

The Duu Guusd Conservancy area has dozens of peregrine falcon nests, and nesting and habitat for norther saw-shet owls, northern goshawks, marbeled and ancient murrelets and auklets.

Although the conservancy area was closed during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis, some B.C. Provincial Parks were slated for reopening in late May, 2020. Check this website for current information about access.

the heart of the city centre, is proving hugely popular during the country’s lockdown.

Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust has today spoken of its relief that a chick has been spotted in the nest of a peregrine falcon family it monitors in partnership with Nottingham Trent University.

The nest, on the University’s Newton Building in Nottingham city centre, is covered by a webcam which has been receiving an extraordinary number of views during the lockdown, as people seek out a connection with wildlife whilst staying at home.

It was feared that the peregrine pair may suffer a barren year after an egg laid on March 16th failed to hatch within the usual timeframe, but new hope arrived when the female unexpectedly laid two further eggs in early April after an unusually long delay.

Webcam viewers had been predicting if and when any of the eggs would hatch, with some hoping for a chick to coincide with the VE Day Anniversary Celebrations planned for Friday. However, an excited member of the Wildlife Trust Communications Team spotted what she thought might be a chick on Wednesday afternoon before managing to capture a short video clip to confirm the good news.

Speaking on behalf of Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust, Head of Communications Erin McDaid, said: “This pair certainly know how to put us through the emotional wringer. After the first egg failed to hatch on time we thought we were unlikely to see any chicks this year, but the arrival of the second and third eggs gave us hope. The numbers of people watching the camera so far during lockdown have been amazing – so who knows what will happen now we actually have a chick!”

Speaking on behalf of Nottingham Trent University (NTU) Sustainable Development Manager Charmaine Morrell said: “We’re absolutely delighted to have a chick in the nest and whilst it’s sad that we’re not on campus, it’s fantastic that along with viewers from around the world, NTU staff and students can all watch its progress via the webcam.”

A webcam was originally installed purely as a security measure on advice from Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust to the University more than a decade ago but subsequent improvements in technology meant that the feed could be shared over the internet.

Viewing figures for April had already beaten last season’s high and the arrival of the chick is expected to push the numbers viewing even higher.

Erin added: “The camera has always been popular, but this year the lockdown means that many more people are turning to webcams in their efforts to retain a connection with nature.”

The webcam can be accessed via the Nottingham Trent University website, to where it is housed on the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust’s site."~[]

How Covid-19 could push wildlife back to the brink

By Patrick Greenfield and Peter Muiruri / The Guardian





From the vast plains of the Masai Mara in Kenya to the delicate corals of the Aldabra atoll in the Seychelles, conservation work to protect some of the world’s most important ecosystems is facing crisis following a collapse in ecotourism during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Organizations that depend on visitors to fund projects for critically endangered species and rare habitats could be forced to close, according to wildlife NGOs, after border closures and worldwide travel restrictions abruptly halted millions of pounds of income from tourism.

Throughout the pandemic, scientists have repeatedly urged humanity to reset its relationship with nature or suffer worse outbreaks. But the economic consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown have raised fears of a surge in poaching, illegal fishing and deforestation in life-sustaining ecosystems, with tens of thousands of jobs in the ecotourism sector at risk around the world.

“It’s right that the global focus now is on protecting human lives in this devastating pandemic. However, in the places we work, we are already witnessing its economic impact, particularly in areas where communities rely heavily on ecotourism for their livelihoods,” said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF UK.

In Cambodia, three critically endangered giant ibis were killed for meat in early April following the collapse of the local tourism industry, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society. In central Africa, measures to shield mountain gorillas from the virus have resulted in a slump in vital visitor revenue. Twelve rangers who guarded Virunga national park, where the gorillas live, were killed in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo last month.

“It could be years before these places can fully recover, increasing the risk that people come to rely on other activities to make a living, putting unsustainable pressure on natural resources,” Bartlett said. “Additionally it is currently much harder to monitor land grabbing and illegal poaching.”

While the poaching of rhinos, big cats and critically endangered species has continued during lockdown, a recent Wildlife Justice Commission report found the illegal wildlife trade had been severely disrupted by movement and travel restrictions.

But conservationists fear an explosion of illegal hunting if organizations are forced to lay off wildlife rangers and suspend surveillance programs. Black rhinos in the Okavango Delta, Botswana, have been evacuated after at least six were killed by poachers in March.

Dickson Kaelo, chief executive officer at Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, said all bookings for this year’s key activities such as the wildebeest migration in the Masai Mara had been canceled, prompting difficult choices about staff in Kenya’s conservancies.

“While elephant poaching may not escalate owing to the current suppression of international travel and negative sentiments against animal products in south-east Asia, demand for bushmeat will go up if there is nobody to monitor activities within the conservancies,” he said.

“Poaching for bushmeat already existed on a small scale even before the coronavirus outbreak. With more Kenyans out of work, bushmeat will be more appealing than meat sold by the licensed butcher. If the rangers have no salaries, how will they effectively monitor human activities in and out of the conservancies?”

Wildlife conservation in Kenya had already suffered a series of setbacks following a devastating locust invasion and a viral outbreak among livestock in the Greater Mara conservation area. Kaelo said coronavirus will compound the effects on community-led wildlife conservation.

“Members of these communities may lose faith in wildlife conservation if there is no money forthcoming. In addition, people who live around these wildlife havens and looked forward to selling artifacts to tourists may resort to other income-generating activities such as farming, fueling the never-ending human-wildlife conflicts as animals invade and destroy their new farms,” he said.

In Colombia, the big cat conservation organization Panthera has recorded a spike in big cat poaching, with two jaguars, an ocelot and a puma killed in recent weeks. The organization is struggling to fund basic running costs as donations dry up or are delayed.

While rangers are forced to stay at home, Esteban Payan, director of the jaguar program in the region, said he was concerned about illegal land grabbing and intentional wildfires.

“My worst fear post-pandemic is that once we go out, we’re going to find hectares and hectares of fenced-out new farmland where you don’t know who they are or what is happening. There’s rampant deforestation in Colombia right now in the Amazon.

“That worries me more than increased poaching. Why? Because of the scale, size and speed of deforestation and fires. That just destroys the habitat. And with the habitat, there go the jaguars. You might not see a bloody animal on the ground with a bullet in it but it’s worse because they’re either homeless and burned, burned alive or they don’t have any prey.”

Global Fishing Watch has recorded a substantial drop in fishing around the world, with fishing hours down by more than 37 percent from March 11 to the end of last month compared with the past two years. But the drop in ecotourism has affected conservation of the world’s most precious marine ecosystems.

Fanny Douvere, UNESCO’s marine program coordinator for 50 world heritage sites, including the Great Barrier Reef, the Galapagos Islands and the West Norwegian Fjords, warned of the consequences of the downturn.

“We need to be particularly worried about those sites that are heavily dependent on tourism revenues to finance some of their operations. In the Seychelles, for example, Aldabra atoll is not sure how it’s going to continue with its monitoring because it’s entirely financed by revenues from tourism,” she said.

Gov. Ned Lamont announced in late April that some establishments, ranging from zoos with outdoor exhibits to restaurants with outdoor seating, can reopen on May 20 — so long as Connecticut doesn’t see a surge in cases or hospitalizations.

For the Beardsley Zoo in Bridgeport, staff have been prepared to reopen since the facility closed to visitors because of the new coronavirus back in March, according to zoo Director Gregg Dancho.

“We have to do it the right way when we reopen,” he said during a recent interview. “It’s still very tentative.”

But while planning for a reopening is difficult enough, Dancho said, the facility’s staff also has to continue to care for its animals, knowing that some cats at another facility have tested positive for the virus after showing symptoms.

Dancho said the Bridgeport zoo — which has many big cats including two Amur tigers and two Amur leopards — immediately had staffers working with the big cats don additional protective gear when news spread that a tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York had tested positive for COVID-19.

The Bronx Zoo confirmed on April 5 that 4-year-old Nadia, a Malayan tiger, had been infected with the new coronavirus. She was the first animal to show symptoms, the zoo said in a statement.

Samples were collected from Nadia’s nose, throat and respiratory tract while under anesthesia, the Bronx Zoo said. Those samples were tested and she was confirmed to be infected with the virus.

Nadia’s sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions at the New York City zoo also developed a dry cough, the zoo said. Fecal samples were collected from the six big cats; they all tested positive.

The zoo said the animals saw “some decrease in appetite” and a cough — although one tiger never developed a cough but did test positive for the virus.

So far, no animals at the Bridgeport zoo have exhibited COVID-19 symptoms.

To help care for all the zoo’s animals, Beardsley has a full-time veterinarian technician who has worked with the zoo for years, doing rounds twice a week. Dancho said one of the most important aspects of zoo operations behind the scenes is preventative medicine.

“Testing is always a big thing for us,” he said.

Dancho said staffers collect fecal samples to check for illnesses like worms, and blood samples to test for things like anemia. He said testing is also done for rabies and tuberculosis.

“Every animal at the zoo has some kind of examination at least once a year,” Dancho said.

Sometimes those exams can be visual to check for behavioral or diet changes, while others are more physical and require tranquilization or anesthesia at the zoo’s on-site animal care center — which serves as a fully-equipped veterinarian hospital with X-ray machines, holding rooms, a treatment room and an operating room.

Being a long-time accredited member of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums and caring for various threatened species, Beardsley Zoo staffers are always on high alert for any changes in the facility’s animals.

“We’re watching these animals all the time,” Dancho said. “When something is off, the staff knows immediately.”

If one of the big cats at the zoo started to develop symptoms linked to the new coronavirus, Dancho said, staffers would keep a closer eye on the animal for a few days to see if the behavior or symptoms continues. If so, then staffers would prepare for testing.

“We would have to tranquilize the animal, especially with tigers,” Dancho said.

But since the tigers are conditioned through training to walk into a crate to be brought to the zoo’s animal care center, he said, they wouldn’t necessarily have to be tranquilized in their habitat, which can cause stress.

“Tranquilization of an animal is something we try to avoid the most,” he said.

Once the animal is in the care center and under sedation, Dancho said, “it’s just like your dog going to the veterinarian.”

He said if an animal showed signs of the new coronavirus, the zoo would run a full workup as a precaution, including blood tests and a dental exam.

“You want to make sure you’re covering all the bases, especially when you’re working with such critically endangered species,” Dancho said.

For now, he said, the zoo will continue to take additional precautions until the pandemic passes.

“Our staff is gowned up, masks on, gloves on,” Dancho said. “They are monitoring the health and welfare of the animals every day.”"~[]

That's right! For a modest entry fee, you too can see and cuddle some of Joe Exotic's famous big cats. He's definitely around in spirit, even though the park is now run by Jeff and Lauren Lowe, the new owners.

TMZ reported huge crowds at the grand re-opening, and social distancing was out the proverbial window. The controversial practice of cub petting is still an option, and it seems like the popularity of the recent Netflix documentary, Tiger King, has drummed up increased business for the infamous exotic animal park.

General admission is just $15 per person and $10 for children under 12. If you have $80 to spare, you can get a two-person appointment for six minutes of playtime in the nursery with the baby animals. For the full VIP tour, you'll have to shell out $195 per person, but it includes a full tour of the zoo, with impromptu feeding opportunities with all different types of animals.

If you can't quite swing the trip to Oklahoma, you can always show your big cat love with some official Tiger King merchandise. Tiger-striped T-shirt? Don't mind if I do!

MANCHESTER, NH — If you enjoy nature shows and watching the ups and downs of what it takes to raise your young in downtown Manchester then you may want to check out NH Audubon’s live peregrine cams, which are up and running. There are a few camera views to choose from here.

We checked out the one below this morning and got a clear view of two hatchlings (fun fact: proper name for a baby falcon is eyas) watching breakfast being prepared (warning, graphic footage of breakfast being prepared.)

Two of the five eyasses hatched on May 2. The peregrines have been nesting in the Brady Sullivan tower for more than a decade, and NH Audubon has been hovering over peregrine procreation for nearly 40 years.

Here’s a rundown from the current 2020 Manchester’s Peregrine Falcons Daily Log

Most times are from Feed 1. F2 (Feed 2) and F3 (Feed 3) indicate times taken from those cameras.

(Please note: This log is updated by volunteers while viewing the activity of the falcons. There will be times where there are gaps in the timeline. We try to record all visits but an editor may not be available.)

Dean Schneider, a safari park owner and Instagram influencer, is under investigation after footage of him punching a lion surfaced on Instagram, according to the Sun.

Schneider left his job in Switzerland to move to South Africa to care for lions at the Hakuna Mipaka Oasis lion reserve. He shares photos to his millions of followers of him interacting with and caring for animals at the park. According to their website, the park says it doesn’t accept tourists or participate in the breeding or trade of wild animals.

But Schneider is regularly seen to be in close contact with lions in the park. A clip from 2019 shows Schneider interacting with a lion, the lion then paws at Schneider’s head and appears to scratch his neck as the cub pulls away. Schneider yelps and then appears to begin punching the cub.

Schneider described his work in March 2019, “I wouldn’t call it playing with lions. Because it’s more living with lions, and being part of their pride. And yes, one part of it is, of course, playing – the same as we humans also like to play with one another. But there are a lot of other serious situations that I’m also part of and this is why I actually don’t like to promote what I’m doing as just playing with lions. It’s definitely not a good idea to play with lions! Getting hurt by a lion while spending time with them is totally normal.”

Here’s a clip of Schneider punching the animal:

A spokesperson for Schneider said of the incident that he “needs to communicate his boundaries,” when interacting with lions. The South Africa National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has reportedly called his lack of transparency “troubling.”

Tanda and her latest daughter (Zoo Zürich, Cordula Galeffi)

A white rhinoceros has been born for the first time in Zurich Zoo. Visitors can see the baby girl from June 8, when zoos re-open.

Mother Tanda, 27, and baby are doing well, Zurich Zoo said on Fridayexternal link. Tanda is already breastfeeding her baby, who was born on Thursday and as yet doesn’t have a name.

The latest zoo resident is the seventh baby for Tanda, who arrived – pregnant – at Zurich Zoo in December from an Israeli zoo, accompanied by two of her daughters and a young male. The gestation period lasted 487 days (16 months).

The white rhinos of Zurich Zoo live in the large new Lewa Savannahexternal link, which they share with giraffes, zebras, antelopes and ostriches. The area was inaugurated in the absence of the public due to the coronavirus crisis.

Closed enclosures

Not everyone is happy about how zoos have been treated during the pandemic. Industry umbrella association Zooschweizexternal link said on Thursday it was “incomprehensible” that museums could re-open from May 11 but not zoos and animal parks. This was “unequal treatment” which was “unacceptable”, it said.

Zoo visitors are mainly outside where the risk of infection is lower than in closed rooms in museums, it argued.

Although Swiss zoos are closed for the time being, that hasn’t stopped children at home from learning how the animals live and behave behind closed gates:

Many social media users certainly believe so. A video of a group of female lions and their cubs strolling on the roadside, shot from inside a car, is going viral on social media with the claim that they were spotted at Dhaula Kuan near Delhi Cantonment.

Multiple videos and images of nilgai, deer, jackals, foxes and other wild animals in public places have been doing the rounds on social media in the lockdown period. Netizens say with humans stuck indoors, nature is “healing itself”. However, this video of a pack of lions in the Capital seemed too sensational to be true.

India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the video is misleading. The video is not from Delhi but Rajula in Gujarat’s Amreli district.

The video, along with the misleading claim, is being shared widely on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. The archived version of the post can be seen here .

AFWA investigation

Using keywords such as “lions on streets in India”, we came across several videos on Google wherein lions could be seen walking on the roads. Most of these videos were from Gujarat, more specifically, the area around Gir national park. Asiatic lions, as seen in the viral video, are only found in Gir in the entire world. In fact, it is not uncommon to sight lions in areas nearby Gir national park.

Searching the Internet, we came across a YouTube video of a pride of lions, wherein the location seemed similar to the viral video. The YouTube channel called “GirIndiaFilms HD” has a video of a pride of lions strolling on the street. The title of this video, dated January 11, 2016, says it is from Pipavav shipyard road near Gir forest.

We contacted the person who runs the YouTube channel. His name is Hanif Khokhar and he is a local journalist. We forwarded the viral video to Khokhar, who said it is also from Pipavav road in Rajula town in Gujarat’s Amreli district. No doubt, the similarities were too striking to miss.

Junagadh chief conservator of forests (wildlife) Dushyant Vasavada also said that the viral video is not from Delhi but most likely from Rajula. Ishwar Singh, principal chief conservator in Delhi forest department, said since there is no forest corridor from Gir to Delhi, it is impossible for the lions to travel all the way from Gujarat to the capital.

Some social media users have also claimed that the tall structure seen in the background is a statue of Lord Shiva. But as per Khokhar, it is a cement factory in Rajula.

Conclusion

Experts say the sight of lions walking on the streets near Gir forest is very common. There are multiple news reports of such incidents too.

Penguins, jackals, deer, foxes, peacocks and several other wild animals have been spotted on the streets acros s the world during lockdown.

But from the above evidence, it can be said that the claim along with the video is false. This video of a pride of lions walking on the roadside is from Gujarat’s Rajula and not Delhi. However, we could not ascertain when the video was shot.

pastel eagle man carrying ambassador eagle wendy hall~"The bald eagle is not only our nation’s most recognizable natural symbol, and the only eagle found exclusively in North America, it is also the Endangered Species Act’s most prominent success story, and a reminder of how important are the protection of our wildlife, critical habitat and natural resources generally.

Populations of breeding pairs of bald eagles in the lower forty-eight states crashed in the late 1960s to just over 400 pairs, due to hunting, habitat destruction and most prominently, the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture, such as DDT. In a scary process, known as “biomagnification,” bald eagles, being an apex predator at the top on their food chain, and feeding mainly on fish, occasional small rodents and carrion, in other words, wildlife which had themselves absorbed toxins in various forms ultimately from pesticide-laden vegetation or runoff from agricultural fields, suffer highly concentrated, elevated levels of these toxins, negatively impacting birth and mortality rates. Calcium deficiencies caused by the toxins resulted in the thinning of eggshells, which would collapse under the nesting female’s weight, causing a nosedive in successful eaglet births.

The Endangered Species Act of 1973 was the result of the attention called to these and related problems by wildlife lovers, falconers, hunters and others concerned about the fate of our native species. With the banning of the pesticides most harmful to wildlife in the United States, eagle numbers recovered, with the result that the bald eagle went from “endangered” to “threatened”, and to finally “delisted” in 2007, as mating pairs reached over 11,000 in the lower forty-eight. Eagles were never as threatened in Alaska and British Columbia, and Alaska still has about 80% of the World’s bald eagles. Many raptors joined in the recovery, due to the banning of these pesticides, most notably, the peregrine falcon.



Of course, the problem with pesticides is far from over, as most folks don’t realize that the sale of these pesticides was banned by the EPA in the U.S., and later in many other western nations, but they are still being used in Africa, Asia and South America. DDT is said to help fight malaria in third world nations, and Swainsons Hawks, which nest on the Canadian-American prairies, remain on the endangered species list, because they winter on the Argentine Pampas, where Swainsons die-offs from an inexpensive but lethal pesticide, monocrotophos, were still a problem in the late nineties.



There is also a downside to “delisting,” as it opens formerly protected critical habitat to development and some of the very pressures that contributed to the decline of the eagle in the first place.

Adirondack comeback

Bald eagles disappeared from the Adirondacks by the early sixties, but in 1981, Peter Nye, an eagle biologist and leader of the Endangered Species Unit of the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, traveled to Alaska on a mission to repopulate the Adirondacks with bald eagles. Alaska has four times as many eagles as the rest of the country, so Nye’s mission, in a process known as “hacking,” was to take wild eaglets mature enough to care for themselves and just about ready to fly, transport them to New York, build nests protected from climbing predators like fishers, gray fox and black bears, and release them in a remote area, unvisited by people, in the hopes that the eagles would begin breeding, nesting and repopulating New York.



A logical place to release them was Follensby Pond, a remote wilderness area of over 14,000 acres, once home to bald eagles, and the site of a famous get together in 1858 known as the “Philosophers Camp”, which was organized by painter William James Stillman, and included poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson, poet and diplomat James Russell Lowell and paleontologist, geologist and all around naturalist, Louis Agassiz.



The owners of the Follensby Wilderness, John and Bird McCormick, sold the property to the Nature Conservancy in 2008, on the condition that the Nature Conservancy work with New York State to ensure that the Wilderness remains wild, and inaccessible to the public, at least for the foreseeable future. It is here that Nye hacked the eagles, with the result that there are today in 2020 probably 24 nesting pairs of eagles in the Adirondacks, and over 200 pairs in New York State. Way to go, Pete!

Nesting habits

Bald eagles are usually monogamous, and a mating pair will use the same nest every year, like a home owner, constantly tweaking it and adding to it, with the result that bald eagle nests can measure ten feet wide and ten feet thick, weigh up to a ton and are the largest nests of any bird, aided by the fact that eagles can begin mating by their fourth or fifth year, and can live over thirty years. The record size nest is two and a half tons, but some nests eventually collapse under their own weight, and a new nest has to be constructed. The nest of our oldest non-flighted bald eagle at the Adirondack Wildlife Refuge, Sylvia, was blown down in a Pacific storm while she was still a fledgling, resulting in the permanent disabling which resulted in her living with us. Her two male siblings were successfully rehabbed and released.

Nests are typically located very high in old growth conifer or hardwood trees, ranging from only twenty feet above water when the tree’s trunk is in the water, to 125 feet high when the tree is on land , protruding above smaller trees, and within two miles of large bodies of both salt and fresh water, with most within sight of open water. All else being equal, for example, the potential for scavenging deer and other carrion, and for kleptoparasitism, stealing fish from ospreys or carrion from other scavengers, a nesting pair will generally require a lake of at least four or five square miles in order to make a living.

Eagles nest and breed earlier than other raptors, with the female laying one to four eggs in sequence between mid February and mid March, depending on climate and latitude, with hatching between mid April and early May, and branching and fledging late June to early July. As with some other raptors, older and larger siblings, those which hatch first may monopolize more food from its parents, by pushing younger siblings out of the nest. Eaglets grow quickly, gaining up to six ounces per day, beginning to flap their wings at 8 weeks, fledging between 8 to 14 weeks, and finally leaving the nest area about 8 weeks after fledging.

Current threats

The number one killer of the bald eagle in America today is lead poisoning, which the eagles pick up while scavenging the remains of game, mainly white tailed deer taken by hunters using lead based bullets, which shatter on impact, sending lead shards into flesh, often away from the path of the bullet. This is a problem easily solved by having hunters switch to solid ammunition, such as copper, but the NRA sees this as an attempt to take your weapons.

That’s like saying that when the state mandates seat belt use, that is an attempt to take your car, but such is the ridiculous logic employed in polarized political debate today. No one is saying don’t hunt, just change the type of ammunition you use. States like California have made this argument academic, by banning the use of lead ammunition, just as many states have banned the use of lead sinkers, which can be mistaken for pebbles and swallowed as aids in digestion by loons and other waterfowl.

people overseas creaturely life” challenge giggs pose wejustine hydescribe  ~"In her debut book of nonfiction, Fathoms: The World in the Whale, Rebecca Giggs is our mystic guide through the intertwining relationship of humans and whales, which is marked by ferocity – of both love and violence – on the human side of the ledger. Giggs shows how our impact on these majestic creatures and their cetacean cousins has been at best detrimental; and at worst, catastrophic. Whales are the animals we have culled in the largest numbers, pursuing and exploiting them across the oceans and almost to extinction.

Opening with “Whalefall”, an edited version of Giggs’s 2015 Granta essay, Fathoms is horrific, poetic and profound; a morbid dirge shot through with celestial light. As well as being an extensively researched and deeply considered study, the book is also a wunderkammer of tales that illustrate the hot mess of human aggression, obliviousness and folly. Take “cute aggression” – a violent impulse towards cute animals – as an example. Giggs describes the “tableaux of devotion” of a young La Plata dolphin surrounded by worshipping tourists at a Buenos Aires beach. In the clamour to hold the creature and to snap selfies, the tourists literally “love” the dolphin to death.

Giggs is haunted by whales and their ghosts. From a childhood rendezvous with a blue whale skeleton in the Western Australian Museum, to witnessing the slow demise of a beached humpback on her local beach boiling to death within its own blubber and crushed by the weight of its skeleton, to making eye contact with a primal-fear-inducing mother whale during a whale-watching trip, these encounters are portals for Giggs to step into the cetacean world, a threshold often marked by death at the hands of humans.

The author traces the ceremonial and traditional history of whaling among people in regions of the Earth, stretching from pole to pole, but it is the industrialised massacres of the 19th and 20th century – even well after the commercial demand for whale products had waned, replaced by synthetic materials such as plastic – that read like military “shock and awe” tactics of human domination over the natural world. The myriad ways that whale bodies were carved up to be used in products for human convenience is a catalogue of grisly wonder. Whales as meat. Whales as oil for streetlamps, printing ink and machinery lubrication. Whalebone as women’s corsets and police nightsticks, as hula hoops and springs in pocket watches. So pervasive was the use of whale products during the 19th century that it literally fuelled the Industrial Revolution.

Faded “Save the Whale” bumper stickers are a 1980s childhood memory for Giggs. The anti-whaling movement inspired the first global environmental citizens, with whales as their charismatic icons. Eventually, campaigning forced large-scale commercial whaling to end. Harpooning, flensing and boiling down whales was a gruesome and messy industry. After the slaughter ceased, whale populations began to rebound but Giggs shows this was ultimately a hollow victory. Subsequent and continuing human impact on whales is less immediately visible but equally, if not more, sinister. She writes: “No whale species was ever driven to extinction by whaling, for all its sweeping violence – but cetaceans have disappeared from the planet, already, as a result of pollution.”

For Giggs, the symbolism of a sperm whale in Spain washing up dead with an entire greenhouse in its belly proves irresistible. This metaphor for climate change leads her to uncover the ways we have disturbed the ocean’s delicate ecological web and, in doing so, altered whales’ environment, changed them at a cellular level, created the conditions for cross-species breeding, pushed them into new habitats and even shifted the pitch of their song. The indigestible and eternal scourge of plastic, the industrial flowoff of pesticides and oceans that continue to warm and acidify are all bringing whales undone. Killer whales in Puget Sound, off the Seattle coast, are Earth’s “most toxified animals”, writes Giggs, while beluga whale carcasses in Canada are “classed as toxic waste”. Inuit women, who live in one of the most isolated parts of Earth, are warned off breastfeeding because the whale meat they consume is so contaminated it poses a risk to their infants.

Fathoms is a vast book, the scale of which brings to mind the blue whale, anatomically mysterious and the largest creature to have lived. Giggs weaves together cosmological phenomena with their deep-sea reverberations to give us a book that feels universal. The chapter headings – inspired by Matthew Fontaine Maury’s 1855 The Physical Geography of the Sea, and Its Meteorology – list curious topics that create a strange poetry: “Mer-Whales Share a Smoke”, “Self-Importance of a Whale Louse”, “Kraken, Owl”, “A Beluga Passes Gravesend” and “Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec Cooks a Dolphin” all invite further investigation.

While she sets out to tell “a new story” about whales, Giggs wrestles with the much bigger questions of human yearning for wildness and vastness, and our moral obligation to nature in all its forms, not just charismatic megafauna such as whales. The weightiness of Giggs’s research, and her occasional drift of focus, is balanced by her bright and moving prose, which skilfully blends natural history, science, philosophy and memoir, placing her in the ranks of accomplished contemporary nature writers such as Philip Hoare, Robert Macfarlane and Helen Macdonald.

Giggs is not without hope that we can learn from whales and understand our place in and power over the natural world, and that we can use this power to effect positive change. She calls for action: “A whale is a wonder not because it is the world’s biggest animal, but because it augments our moral capacity. A whale shows us it is possible to care for that which lies outside our immediate sphere of action … the future generations, the vulnerable people overseas, the creaturely life.” The challenge Giggs poses is, will we?

The fuzzy little cubs were born in April to their 4-year-old mother Kamara and are staying behind-the-scenes at the zoo in a special area until they’re big enough to join the rest of the pride and go on display.

We're wishing a happy #MothersDay to all the moms out there! Kamara is celebrating today with her two newborn cubs, and we're so excited to share that her cubs are male and female.

The brother and sister were born almost a year after another cub, Tatu, was born in July 2019. All of the cubs were fathered by 4-year-old Tobias, who was moved into the zoo in 2018 in hopes that he would breed with the zoo’s female lions.

African lions face growing threats from poaching, loss of habitat and loss of prey, and the birth of the cubs this year helps to keep a healthy, genetically diverse population of lions among zoos."~[]

(Matthew 12:39-40 , Luke 11:29-32)” But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the Prophet Jonah”.[v.40- “For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

(John 1:1-4) For those who know Jesus is God this should be sufficient evidence to believe the story of Jonah to be historically true. For those of you who don’t there are many more reasons to believe this story to be historically accurate.

Are there any monsters of the deep big enough to swallow a man? Yes!! Grace W. Kellogg, in his book The Bible Today, describes a few. “There are at least 2 known monsters of the deep that could easily have swallowed Jonah. They are the Balaenoptera Musculus or sulphur-bottom whale, and the Rhinodon Typicus or whale shark.” Neither monster has any teeth. They open their enormous jaws and take in water at an incredible speed, then strain out the water and swallow what ever is left. In 1933 a sulphur-bottom whale was captured off Cape Cod. It was 100 ft long with a mouth 10 or 12 ft wide. Kellogg goes on to say that, “these whales have 4 to 6 compartments in their stomachs, in any one of which a colony of men could find free lodging. They might even have a choice of rooms, for in the head of this whale is a wonderful air storage chamber, an enlargement of the nasal sinus, often measuring 7 ft wide, by 14 ft long. If he has an unwelcome guest on board who gives him a headache, the whale swims to the nearest land and gets rid of the offender as he did Jonah.”

Kellogg also points out that the late Dr. Dixon “tells of a white shark of the Mediterranean which swallowed a whole horse; another swallowed a reindeer minus only it’s horns. In still another Mediterranean white shark was found a whole sea cow, about the size of an ox.”

Clearly there are monsters large enough, which makes this story of Jonah plausible, but of coarse there is more.

The Cleveland Plain Dealer quoted an article by Dr. Ransom Harvey who said that a dog was lost overboard from a ship. The dog was found 6 days later alive and barking in the head of the whale.

Dr. Harry Rimmer, President of the Research Science Bureau of L.A. said they found an account of an English sailor swallowed by a giant Rhinodon in the English Channel in the Literary Digest. Apparently they were trying to harpoon the giant sharks when this sailor fell overboard. Before he could be pulled back in the boat the shark turned around and swallowed him up. 48 hrs after the incident the shark was found and killed. When the shark was opened by the sailors they were amazed to find their friend alive and unconscious. They rushed him to the hospital where they found that he only suffered from shock. He was perfectly healthy and fit otherwise. In 1926 Dr. Rimmer met the man and said that his body was devoid of hair and patches of yellowish-brown color covered his entire skin.

Clearly it’s possible for Jonah to have survived in one of these large fish and no good reason to doubt the truthfulness of the biblical account of Jonah. God could have supernaturally protected Jonah but clearly from the evidence, it was unnecessary in this case. Praise God for the evidence He has left for those of us who, like the apostle Thomas, need some concrete evidence to help us believe.

Sheltering in place during the cornavirus pandemic is a burden for many, but Calistoga painter and sculptor Anne Pentland has made the most of it.

“Luckily as a working visual artist, I am never at a loss to fill my days with creative work at my home studio,” said Pentland, who has served since 2007 as assistant director of the Nimbus Arts community center in St. Helena.

Long fascinated with the crusade to save rare animals around the world, Pentland was particularly moved by the death of the world’s last male white rhinoceros two years ago in Kenya.

“There are two females left, but that is the end of the species,” she said. “A couple of years ago I had created a rhinoceros sculpture for a Day of the Dead altar, and starting in February just before the shelter order, I decided to turn it into a mosaic sculpture.”

That meant wrapping the chicken-wire form of the rhino with sheetrock joint tape, coating with thin-set cement and then applying a layer of glass tiles. It was a long and laborious process, but her effort paid off.

The finished, hollow sculpture weighs 100 pounds, stands three feet tall and glitters, ready for the next art show or for sale when the quarantine ends, a lasting reminder of what the natural world has lost.

“The theme of my work is endangered and threatened species,” Pentland explained. “That is what sculpt and paint.”

Her painting “Sunset for a Species,” which shows the ghostly image of a rhinoceros set against an African landscape, won best of show in the traditional category earlier this month at the fifth annual Animal Kingdom Art Exhibition at Fusion Art in Palm Springs, now on display online at fusionartps.com

“This work also was published as the cover art for the book “Rhino in the Room” by Jill Hedgecock in 2018,” Pentland said.

The artist’s passion for protecting wildlife isn’t limited to rhinos. She created her Madonna series, which includes a lemur and a lion. Her painting “Iguana Madonna” fetched a winning bid of $20,000 at her arts center’s annual “Nimbash” fundraising auction last year, attended by more than 350 people. The event is usually held every May.

“Of course, with the pandemic, everything is shut down this year,” Pentland said.

While she works away at home, the pandemic also brought a couple of welcome surprises, including news about one favorite animal she thought she’d lost for good.

First, the board of directors at Nimbus Arts applied for and received a Paycheck Protection Program loan to support its staff, which is in turn continuing to offer some services.

“Thanks to our board of directors for working to keep us afloat, we have made art kits to go for families in the community,” Pentland said.

But for the artist, not all recent news has been about the present coronavirus crisis.

“An amazing thing just happened during this pandemic shut-down. One day while working in my studio on the mosaic sculpture, I received a call that our cat Nigel, lost during the evacuation after the 2017 Tubbs fire, had been found,” she said. The cat had disappeared from Pentland’s South Lake Tahoe second home after she fled from the fire.

“So he has been keeping me company in my studio as I resuscitate him back to health. He seems happy to be home, and we are so happy -- and amazed -- to have him back after two and a half years,” she said.

Pentland’s interest in animals embraces all creatures great and small, as human encroachment on wildlife habitats continues around the globe. She is especially enamored of the species native to Africa, and cherished a trip in 2016 to Botswana, where she took photos of wild animals roaming expansive preserves. The pictures serve as reference for creating her artwork.

“I am concerned about these creatures we share the planet with,” she said. “We’re responsible for losing them while we take over their earth.”

Huffman. His favorite animal was the rhinoceros.

There are five different species of rhinos: the Black rhinoceros, the White rhinoceros, the Greater Indian rhinoceros, the Javan rhinoceros, and the Sumatran rhinoceros. All of them are threatened with extinction. Black, Javan, and Sumatran rhinos are listed as critically endangered; Indian and Southern White rhinos are listed as near threatened; and the Northern white rhinoceros is extinct in the wild.

Rhinos are all threatened because of one main problem: relentless poaching for their horns. Even though they’re made of the same substance that makes human fingernails, rhino horns are believed to have medicinal properties. The truth is that they don’t. Our state’s zoos partake in conservation efforts to protect rhinos, such as raising awareness and education.

To help protect the rhino from extinction, we must support these efforts and help fund the studies of wild rhinos. We must also teach people that rhino horns have no medicinal properties. Through all these efforts, we can help make sure that the rhinoceros is here to stay for a long time.

As our animal care team members Nicole MacCorkle and Mariel Lally noted in the last update, both species have a pseudo thumb— an elongated and enlarged wrist bone covered with a fleshy pad of skin—which enables them to easily grasp bamboo. Giant pandas have large molar teeth and strong jaw muscles for crushing tough bamboo, while red pandas shear selected leaves off with their mouths.

Our colleagues in the Department of Nutrition Sciences cut bamboo for the pandas at more than 20 stands across the region—including one at our very own Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia.

One might not think pandas have picky palates when it comes to bamboo, but during winter and spring Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are partial to a species called yellow groove bamboo. It gets its name from the yellow indentation that runs down the hard stalk (a.k.a. the culm.)"~[]

""Until one has loved an animal, a part of one's soul remains unawakened."" – Anatole France

It’s a zoo out there, and Sharleen Khan wouldn’t have it any other way. Khan is a zookeeper at the Emperor Valley Zoo, TT’s official animal enclosure, nestled next to the Botanical Gardens at the base of Lady Chancellor Hill in Port of Spain.

Khan, who has 12 years' hands-on experience working with and promoting wildlife conservation, has been gaining attention and quite a following on social media in videos posted by the zoo, in which she raises awareness about wildlife conservation.

“The videos are part of the zoo’s education programme. It is also geared towards enlightening the public about the plight some animals face and to showcase local wildlife,” she told WMN.

Khan has been fascinated by animals since childhood. She told WMN she helped take care of a variety of animals at her home in Debe, south Trinidad – among them dogs, rabbits, fish and even a pet crab named Sparky given to her by her father. She would also read the Childcraft Encyclopaedia Animal Kingdom volumes cover to cover. So it really was no surprise that she would eventually make a career of caring for animals – more specifically, wild animals.

“I believe my inspiration for working with wildlife stemmed from being exposed to these animals from a young age. As a child my mother took me to the Bronx Zoo, New York Aquarium, Sea World and Toronto Zoo.

“I was fascinated by seeing real-life tigers, elephants, beluga whales, killer whales, Komodo dragons, penguins, etc,” she said.“My childhood dream was always growing up to work with, care for and save animals.”

And that dream has come true.

She described what a typical day for her looks like:

“My day starts with a walk around the entire zoo checking on all the animals – observation checks. Because many of the animals and I have developed a close bond, during my walk on mornings I call their names, they know my voice, and they all come out to excitedly greet or acknowledge me.”

This, she said, is one of the best parts of her day. Then she and her colleagues provide care for orphaned or injured wildlife, such as the orphaned baby agouti Pixie.

“During the morning period, I would also practise conditioning exercises with animals including giraffes, the tigers, mandrill and zebra.”

By the time the zoo is open to visitors (pre-covid19), she would be ready to co-ordinate the daily education programme by greeting guests with animal encounters (meeting and learning about wildlife up close), feeding the giraffes and llamas with visitors and conducting animal talks (telling families all about animals).

“On many days, I carry out zoo tours with schools, teaching students about animals and their importance. On some days I also visit schools with our animal ambassadors throughout Trinidad to teach children and local animals.”

And at the end of the day, her work is still not done, sometimes not even when she gets home.

“On late evenings, before I leave for the day, I walk around the entire zoo for one last check-up of the animals and to say goodbye to my 'kids.' Sometimes I also look after orphaned baby animals literally all day, such as Pixie, who goes home with me for round-the-clock care at this early stage.

“My job is a physically active one and many days I am extremely tired at the end of a day, but I won't have it any other way.

She said one of the best parts of her job is being able to work with children and students every day, enlightening them about animals and their importance in their environment.

""Seeing the fascination on a child’s face when I show them an animal up close is priceless!”

Their fascination reminds Khan of her own childhood and two special memories that stand out for her: seeing a rhinoceros for the first time at the Bronx Zoo in New York, and encountering Crocy, the Emperor Valley Zoo’s large American crocodile, she was nine.

""I stood staring and admiring for a long time at the armour-like skin on this large animal,” she said of the rhino.

She had the same feeling when she saw Crocy.

“I stood staring at how large in size he was!”

As fate would have it, she was able to meet her childhood “love” when she started working at the zoo ten years ago.

“Now, all grown up, I was honoured to work at the zoo helping care for Crocy,” who died a few years later.

Her adult experiences have been just as impressive.

“I had the outstanding opportunity to undergo a training attachment in 2015 at the Australia Zoo, home of one of my role models in my field, the late (conservationist and wild life expert) Steve Irwin, the Crocodile Hunter! This was surely unforgettable – learning about giraffe care, saltwater crocodiles, etc.”

And there were the times when she travelled, just for fun, to see animals in their natural habitats.

“In 2018 I went whale-watching in Puget Sound off Seattle to see one of my favourite wild animals, the killer whales or orcas. I also saw a humpback whale which came straight up to our boat! That was one the things on my to-do list while on this planet and it was a priceless experience for me.

“I also went diving in the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, to see marine life, including sea turtles.”

She does have one regret though, that there is one travel wish that can never be fulfilled.

“I wish I could be able to travel back in time to the age of the dinosaurs to see them in real life. My prize possession is a dinosaur bone fossil which was gifted to me during my travels.”

So does she have a favourite animal?

“After extreme consideration, I have to say I do love killer whales and tigers. With domestic animals, dogs always have my heart as well,” Khan, the owner of two chihuahuas, Kiwi and Strawberry, disclosed.

The youngest of three children, Khan, also has an impressive resume, She holds a BSc in environmental and natural resources management and agricultural science from UWI, St Augustine; is the zoological officer with the Zoological Society of TT Inc; a member of the Manatee Conservation Trust; was an honorary game warden; has served as a Rotarian with the Rotary Club of San Juan; was environmental education officer at the Pointe-a-Pierre Wildfowl Trust; and was among 20 individuals selected from the wider Caribbean region to undergo a Conservation Leadership in the Caribbean (CLiC) programme (2014-2016) for upcoming wildlife leaders.

“I’ve had the opportunity to undergo several training attachments at Tampa’s Lowry Park Zoo, Florida, Smithsonian National Zoo, Washington, Guyana Zoo, National Aquarium, Baltimore, Australia Zoo and most recently, the world-famous San Diego Zoo and San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

“I also participated in several animal-training exercises at the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Annual Conference 2013, 2014 and 2015 hosted by Kansas City Zoo, Disney’s Animal Kingdom and Sea World, Orlando and Utah’s Hogle Zoo.”

But the former Naparima Girls’ High School student is not one to hoard her knowledge and experience. She uses every opportunity she can to educate others, especially children and young people, on wildlife conservation. She writes a column, Sharleen’s Wildlife, in a local newspaper, is invited to lecture at her alma mater on environmental science and wildlife conservation from time to time, and was selected to speak to in commemoration of International Day of Women and Girls in Science 2020 to students of an all-female secondary school.

Khan also keeps current with changes through online studies in zoo animal husbandry.

“I plan to further my career by continued work with the endangered species such as the Bengal tiger and conservation and protection of wild animals in their natural habitats, including the scarlet ibis.

“My goal is to make a difference in the lives of wild animals…I hope to inspire at least one person, one child, to care for and respect wildlife.”"~[]

She accomplishes this impressive feat via invisible chemical compounds called pheromones. As the queen’s subjects groom her, they pick up the information-rich molecules and circulate them throughout the colony.

Sent via air, on land, and even in water, these chemical calls of the wild relay messages regarding sexual availability, territory, and even directions to the buffet.

“A pheromone is a signal that has evolved from the point of view of the sender,” says Tristram Wyatt, a zoologist at the University of Oxford in the U.K. who studies the evolution of pheromones.

For instance, one compound in honeybee pheromones suppresses worker bees from crowning another queen, thus guaranteeing the monarch’s rule. (Read how humans are hijacking scent, the universal animal language.)

That’s different than, say, a mosquito tracking down an animal by its odour, since the animal is not issuing the scent for its own benefit, Wyatt notes.

Tricky mammals

Though our knowledge of pheromones has skyrocketed in recent decades, scientists didn’t identify the first one (bombykol, the scent of the female silkworm moth) until 1959.

The female moth’s “perfume” can be carried for miles, eventually reaching the pheromone receptors on a male’s antennae. When he hits an air pocket containing the chemical, he’ll fly upward and zig zag until hitting another, following the chemical trail back to the female."~[]

The best news is that these AR tigers won’t ever miss their mothers, feel pain or distress, or lash out in frustration the way real tigers used for entertainment do.

What Do Tigers Used in Photo Ops Have to Endure?

In nature, tiger cubs stay with their protective and nurturing mothers for up to two years, but those used for photo ops are torn away from their mothers when they’re just hours, days, or weeks old. Like any other young animals (including human babies), tiger cubs require a lot of sleep, but ones in captivity are often not afforded adequate rest. Cold and heat stress, malnutrition, exhaustion, and infectious diseases affect many of these likely terrified cubs, particularly the youngest ones, whose immune systems aren’t fully developed yet.

Once cubs grow beyond photo-op age (which is, at most, when they’re only a few months old), most are relegated to dingy cages in roadside zoos and sometimes used for breeding to perpetuate the cycle. Some are even killed.

Take Action for Tigers

Did you know that big cats have a unique hyoid bone and large vocal cords that allow them to emit a deep, fierce roar? You could hear a tiger roaring from up to 2 miles away—and that’s as close as you’d ever need to be. Please, never visit roadside zoos, marine parks, or any other businesses that profit from exploiting animals.

Kobe, May 20 (Jiji Press)--The city of Kobe, western Japan, said Tuesday that it will return a female giant panda to China as her lease expires on July 15.

The panda, Tan Tan, came to Kobe Oji Zoo in Hyogo Prefecture in 2000 in response to a request made by the then Kobe mayor after the city was hit hard by a massive earthquake in 1995.

Tan Tan came to the zoo under a 10-year lease but her stay had been extended even after her breeding partner, Kou Kou, died.

Kobe has asked for another extension, but the Chinese side said the aging panda should be taken care of at a place with a better natural environment, according to city officials.

Tan Tan is set to be sent to a conservation research center in Sichuan Province. But the timing has yet to be decided as direct flights to the province have been halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The genetic mysteries of the red panda, whose population has been shrinking dramatically, is just one reason why more research is necessary to better understand how this YouTube sensation contributes to the world’s complex biodiversity.

But it’s no mystery to Angela Glatston – whose telling Twitter handle is @RedPandaLady – why the world should care about protecting the red panda and its family pawprint: the chestnut-and-black hued mammal is the only living member of its lineage, the family Ailuridae.

Once lost, it would be lost forever, warns Glatston, a specialist with the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

“It is unique. As the only member of the Ailuridae, it’s one distinct branch of evolution,” explains Glatston, who chairs the Red Panda Network. “If we lose red pandas, it’s like losing all the entire cat family in the world in one fell swoop.”

The red panda’s mysterious genetics are no surprise, given its penchant for privacy. The domestic cat–sized animal sleeps in trees, tightly snuggled into a thick fur blanket created by its bushy tail against the chill mountain air. The clever creature has even evolved fur tufts on its paw pads to protect against the cold and have better grip on mossy tree trunks and branches.

There is little mystery as to the cause of its presence on the IUCN’s list of endangered species: its preferred food – bamboo, which comprises about 98 percent of its diet – is being destroyed by human encroachment on its habitat, bringing deforestation and development. This is one of the largest factors behind a 50 percent drop in the red panda population between 1998 and 2015, says IUCN.

Population estimates now range from as low as 2,500 to no more than 15,000 red pandas remaining in the species’ home range that stretches across parts of Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar and Nepal. Fragmentation of its territory also exposes the red panda to human threats as it forages in search of bamboo.

Dogs and canine distemper, a viral disease that’s fatal for red pandas, are another significant risk as more people, including cattle herders with dogs, move into its shrinking areas of habitat.

The NGO Traffic suggests hunting and poaching are other significant threats to red pandas and, like IUCN, has urged greater research in order to preserve the species. Bhutan, India, Nepal and Myanmar are beginning to act to protect the red panda, says Glatston. “So there is an improvement… but not as much as I would like.”

In China, red panda numbers dropped by as much as 40 percent in the second half of the last century because of massive habitat loss, increased human activity and poaching, leaving an estimated 3,000 to 7,000 red pandas in China as of 1999.

Still, China could lead new conservation efforts, based on recent studies that buttress the argument for two separate species: the Chinese red panda (Ailurus styani) and the Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens).

If Chinese authorities become seized with the idea of a Red Panda species of their own, they may become much more interested in protecting what is now considered a “secondary” species, behind, of course, the giant panda, says Glatston.

Besides, she points out, the red panda was the first to hold its name, being dubbed “panda” about 50 years before the scene-stealing giant panda – which is actually a bear."~[]

brings jaguar back    ~"Jaguar’s stylish compact sports sedan gets a big refresh for 2020, taking it from also-ran status in this highly competitive segment to one worthy of serious consideration. Jaguar has also streamlined the 2020 XE‘s powertrain selection, with a pair of turbocharged four-cylinders to choose from. Styling tweaks and updated infotainment complete the makeover.

Styling: 8/10

The XE has always been a pretty sharp rig, with a long hood and short-ish tail. Visual upgrades to the 2020 model include slimmer full LED headlights that flank a larger grille with a new mesh design. Both the front and rear bumpers have been redesigned, and in the case of the P300 R-Design, it gets even more aggressive front air intakes. The rear LED taillights are redone as well, echoing those of the tiny E-Pace crossover.

This tester, painted black and sporting optional black 19-inch wheels ($900) along with the Black Exterior Pack ($400) came off as nearly featureless, such was its ability to absorb all light. Shame really. If you want to actually see the XE’s rather elegant design, this is not the way to go.

Safety: 8/10

As this tester was equipped, all the expected safety systems are present and accounted for: blind-spot detection and assist, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, front collision mitigation, rear cross-traffic warning, head-up display, auto-dimming headlights, 360-degree camera, heated windshield, heated washer nozzles, and more. All-wheel drive is standard with the XE P300.

Practicality: 6/10

This is where the XE falls short of the competition. Rear seat legroom is tight for the class and the trunk, while it stretches in quite deep, lacks height. I couldn’t fit in a standard BBQ propane tank in the trunk so it had to go on the back seat. On the plus side, there seems to be reasonable storage in the front cabin area, and Jaguar has redesigned the door pockets to accommodate larger water containers.

User Friendliness: 7/10

Ergonomics are generally good with this P300 which, with the $1,540 Technology Pack, gets Jaguar Land Rover’s latest infotainment setup that augments the main 10-inch touchscreen with a lower 5.5-inch screen between two large, multifunction rotary knobs for HVAC and seat heating/ventilation control.

Like any multi-layer infotainment interface, some study is necessary, but overall the menu structure is easy to negotiate and the graphics are clear. However, the interface isn’t as fast as systems from premium German automakers, and its response to voice commands was sketchy at best. Some simple commands took several attempts, and when dictating a navigation destination, it asks you to spell out each word.

The 2020 XE gets the electronic shifter from the F-Type sports car, replacing the previous rotary type. Is it an improvement? Personally, I like the older one. The XE also gets the F-Type’s driving mode toggle switch, which is a bonus.

The driving position in this sport sedan is excellent, and new this year is a very stylish steering wheel from the Jaguar I-Pace EV. The new digital gauge cluster has pin-sharp graphics – something that has eluded JLR products for years. And compared to when the XE was first launched, the car’s cabin quality has improved dramatically. The quality of materials, design, and overall look are perfectly in keeping with segment expectations and the badge on the grille.

Outward visibility is not the XE’s strong suit. The A-pillars and large mirrors impede sightlines when cornering, and the pinched rearward view will make you glad you opted for the 360-degree camera.

Features: 6/10

The XE P300 R-Dynamic comes with a healthy list of standard safety and luxury features, but niceties such as a heated steering wheel, blind-spot assist, and 12-way memory seats require delving into the options list. New available features for 2020 include wireless charging, a digital rear-view mirror (via a camera mounted in the shark-fin antenna) and driver attention monitor. Jag’s latest head-up display – again optional – is clear and informative.

Power: 8/10

JLR’s 2.0L turbo four-cylinder, the only engine offered, is a good one. In P300 tune it makes 296 hp and 295 lb-ft of torque, delivering that oomph in a linear and eager fashion. This car feels genuinely quick, and the engine avoids the coarseness that afflicts some other 2.0L turbos. In Dynamic mode, the four-pot kicks out a cool little growl, too. Opting for the P250 model results in 247 hp and 269 lb-ft of torque.

Comfort: 8/10

We expect Jaguars to be comfortable, even the compact sport sedans, and here the XE does not disappoint. While this car was not equipped with the optional $1,315 adaptive dampers, it still showed a masterful blend of compliance and sharp body control. This is not a sports sedan that announces its athleticism to your backside over every bump, and it’s a quiet and stable highway cruiser, too. I would like the seats to be a little softer, though they proved comfortable during a long drive.

Driving Feel: 9/10

This is where the 2020 Jaguar XE P 300 R-Dynamic shines. It has quick and accurate steering, and the body stays remarkable flat in corners. Get the P300 up on its toes on a twisty road and it makes for a highly entertaining dance partner; there’s plenty of grip and the rear-biased all-wheel drive comes into play when powering out of bends. All the elements meld into a cohesively dynamic whole.

Fuel Economy: 7/10

Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) rates the 2020 Jaguar P300 R-Dynamic at 10.7 L/100 km in the city, 7.7 on the highway, and 9.4 combined – certainly representative of a 2.0L turbo in this state of tune. The more modestly powered 2020 BMW 330i xDrive (255 hp) drinks less fuel at 9.5 L/100 km around town, 6.9 on the highway, and 8.3 combined.

Value: 8/10

Jaguar has priced this sports sedan right in line with the competition. With a base price of $55,800 the 2020 Jaguar XE P300 R-Dynamic slots in above the $49,000 2020 BMW 330i xDrive. However, to match the features of this Jag and its as-tested sticker of $61,630 before taxes and freight, the BMW quickly gets into similar territory.

The Verdict

Tight back seat and smallish trunk aside, this vastly improved 2020 Jaguar XE now presents itself as a compelling choice for those kicking tires in Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volvo, and Audi showrooms. Interior quality and tech count are now up to snuff, and if you count an eager engine, engaging dynamics, and the arguable exclusivity of the XE as desirable features, this little Jag shines.

A fresh face and upgraded interior brings Jaguar back into the game.

Last month, the park announced the arrival of two new Père David’s deer calves - a species classified as extinct in the wild.

Since lockdown, the safari park has also shared photographs of its seven African lion cubs, born in August and September last year.

The cubs have grown a lot since the visitors last saw them, but keepers say they're still as mischievous as ever.

West Midland Safari Park closed on March 19 and bosses have said the park will only reopen when it is safe to do so.

New Delhi: The near complete absence of genetic diversity in Indian lions is putting the species at risk of extinction, a study of the genomes of extinct and living lions suggests.

Researchers from the University of Copenhagen, Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology and others analysed the remains of the now-extinct lions, including Pleistocene cave lions and other historically extinct populations in Africa and the Middle East.

They compared the results of this analysis with modern lions from Africa and India.

Indian lions have been living in a comparatively small area for centuries and therefore inbreeding often took place, claims the study.

This resulted in cranial defects, low sperm count and testosterone levels, as well as smaller manes, according to the report published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Thursday.

This lack of genetic diversity may impact the conservation efforts to save the Indian lion population from extinction.

Indian lions were not artificially brought to the country

The study found that cave lions and the modern lions shared an ancestor till about 5,00,000 years ago.

It also discovered that within modern lions, two main lineages that used to live in Central and Western Africa diverged from the ancestors of the subspecies that used to inhabit Northern Africa about 70,000 years ago.

The descendants of the subspecies from Northern Africa inhabit India now, the report found. This suggests that lions migrated through corridors between Sub-Saharan African and the Near East that may have existed in the past, for instance, through the Nile basin.

It dispels a popular myth about lions being artificially brought to India in the pre-colonial era.

“The obtained results demonstrate the power given to us by the era of genome research. We can apply it to discover the secrets of the past by reading the fragments of DNA taken from modern species’ ancestors. Apart from that, a troubling reduction in Indian lion genetic material was proved,” said Stephen O’Brien from the ITMO University in Russia, who was involved in the study.

In the last two centuries, the global population of lions has decreased by 90 per cent. Apart from zoos, these lion populations now only exist in Western and Central Africa, as well as in the Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat.

To understand how the lion population reduced, scientists looked at the genome to understand their evolutionary history.

Fossil records are usually used to understand the movement and evolution of species. However, genome sequencing allows scientists to obtain a more complete picture of the evolution of the species through information encoded in the DNA.

Here, scientists analysed the genome of two extinct Pleistocene cave lions, 12 lions from historically extinct populations in Africa and the Middle East, and 6 modern lions from Africa and India.

A humpback whale was spotted by the crew of a Port of Vancouver patrol boat Friday morning (May 22), according to a post on the port authority's Twitter account.

Although the pictures only show a whale's tail, or ""flukes"", rising above the water, humpback tails have a distinct shape and are often presented to view at the water's surface when diving for food.

Because the tails are one of the easiest humpback features to photograph, and because they feature distinctive colour patterns and scars that are unique to each whale, such photos are often used by conservationists and marine biologists worldwide to identify individual humpbacks.

Humpbacks, grey whales, and orcas have been seen in increasing numbers in and around Vancouver Harbour, Indian Arm, English Bay, and Howe Sound in recent years.

There have been several sightings of humpbacks and orcas (which are often called ""killer whales"" but are actually the largest member of the dolphin family) in Burrard Inlet, off West Vancouver, and in the Howe Sound area during the past 10 or 11 days.

Male humpbacks typically grow to a length of about 14 metres, the size of a city bus, while females often attain a length of up to 16 meters (52 feet). According to the Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, one modern female humpback stretched to 19 metres (62 feet), the size of an articulated city bus.

The longest whale ever recorded is the blue whale (up to 33.5 meters, or 110 feet), with fin whales and humpbacks vying for the title of the second-longest (the fin whale just beats out the humpback by a third of a metre, 27.3 metres to 27 metres (89.5 feet to 89 feet).

That female humpback length of 27 metres, although it came from detailed Caribbean whaling accounts from the mid-1800s, is regarded by some researchere as less reliable than modern records, though the species was hunted to near-extinction before international conservation efforts were put in place in the 1960s. Today's usual humpback lengths would put it closer to fifth place in world cetacean size charts, slightly behind the blue, fin, right, and sperm whales.

Whale watchers and photographers are fond of seeking out humpbacks because of their habit of ""breaching"", or throwing themselves vertically out of the water (for up to two-thirds of their body length) and crashing back down on their sides or backs, often accompanied by a large splash.

Humpbacks are also recognizable because of their extremely long pectoral fins, which some whale watchers say give them the appearance of a jet plane. These pectoral fins are the longest, proportionately, of any cetacean (aquatic mammals that include the toothed and baleen whales), often reaching lengths of about five metres (16 feet), a third of their body length.

Conservationists estimate the North Pacific humpback population to be between 18,000 and 20,000. Because of steady population growth of about four percent per year for almost two decades, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) downgraded its 2003 ""threatened"" status of the North Pacific humpback to the lower-risk category of ""special concern"" in 2011.

North Pacific humpacks, like the grey whales often seen off the B.C. coast, give birth in tropical or subtropical seas and migrate north to feed in the spring and summer in cold northern or polar waters, where there is an abundance of the krill (small crustaceans) and small fish (such as herring and juvenile salmon) they feed on. The whales almost never eat in the winter, surviving off stored body fat built up during the spring and summer feeding.

Some humpbacks migrate about 15,000 kilometres every year (round trip), and individual whales have travelled the almost 5,000 kilometres between Alaska and Hawaii in 36 days. Some humpbacks that feed in southern B.C. winter in shallow waters off Mexico."~[]

The 11-month-old brother and sister are the first to have been born at the Wiltshire wildlife attraction for nearly 20 years and are part of a European captive breeding programme for the subspecies.

Native to the far east of Russia, the Amur tiger is the largest of the big cats and can weigh up to 300 kg and measure more than three metres in length.

“Despite the unusual circumstances with no visitors to keep them entertained, Rusty and Yuki are doing great,” said keeper Caleb Hall.

“They have got significantly bigger over the past few months and have grown in confidence as much as they have in stature. They are much more independent of mum Yana, loving to explore and playfight a lot on their own.

“With the better weather they have also started to enjoy the pond, loving to take a dip most days, never at the same time though.

“If one cub is in the pond the other wants to stop them from coming out and trying to push them back into the water.

“Rusty and Yuki are very close though and are always wanting to know what the other one is up to and generally are always within sight of each other at all times, spending 99% of the day together doing the same things,” he added.

In the 1930s the tigers had nearly gone extinct in the wild due to hunting and logging. At one stage it is thought the population fell as low as just 20–30 animals.

Although they are still under severe threat, their status was officially changed from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007.

Wildlife experts believe the current population of around 540 individuals is the highest for more than a century.

There were once nine tiger subspecies, but three – the Bali, Caspian and Javan - became extinct during the 20th century."~[]

These lions can navigate market places at night, find carcasses at gaushalas, avoid humans, and more.

Researchers believe that a holistic approach to conservation is necessary in the long run, one that considers human development alongside lion conservation.

India’s lion census, supposed to be conducted in the first week of May, has been deferred because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But there is little doubt that the number of Asiatic lions in Gujarat has risen since the last count in 2015. Over 50 percent of the country’s lion population currently lives outside a protected area (PA).

Wildlife experts have emphasised that it’s unrealistic to expect free-ranging lions to ‘adjust’ and live together in a small space. Since the protected area is at maximum capacity, it’s only natural that they wander farther in search of territory. How then should humans deal with the increasing population of an endangered carnivore that needs almost 10 kg of meat every day? Do we suspend human development in the name of conservation; should we expect them to live in harmony with us in our high-rise apartments?

With a different take on harmonious coexistence, Stotra Chakrabarti, Post-Doctoral Research Associate, University of Minnesota, says, “It is not easy to live with a large carnivore in your backyard. Coexistence can vary from tolerance to co-occurrence with grudges.” He mentions that according to the 2015 lion census, the lion population grew by 126 percent outside the Gir Protected Area, concurrent to around a 19 percent growth in human population in Gujarat. A consistent growth in lion population would have serious implications for humans and lions, and the efforts to conserve the latter.

Researchers say that a holistic approach to conservation is necessary in the long run, one that considers human development alongside lion conservation. Wildlife biologist Ravi Chellam, CEO, Metastring Foundation, says, “Carnivores like lions and tigers can’t live in multi-storeyed apartments; they need habitat. Lions can’t be a part of the city and village landscapes. It’s easy to say ‘these people like lions’ but lions are large, dangerous animals. They need 8-10 kg of meat a day. Where are they going to get it?” The current answer: livestock.

The lion’s dependence on livestock

Is letting lions prey on livestock a permanent solution? While Gujarat has enough livestock to go around, a recent report by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) shows that the number of villages where lions kill livestock is increasing by about 100 each year. If compensation isn’t revised regularly and its distribution isn’t as prompt as it is now, pastoral farmers will suffer severe losses and may not be as tolerant of lions anymore.

While humans currently coexist with lions, increased interaction between the two could be detrimental to conservation efforts. Research shows that lions outside the protected areas (PAs) have a learnt behaviour towards humans. They can navigate market places at night, find carcasses at gaushalas (cow shelters), avoid humans, and more. The tendency to just scavenge can be particularly detrimental as some cubs may not learn how to hunt because they have access to a steady stream of readily available carcasses. Chellam, who has done in-depth research on the Asiatic lions, adds, “The threats from diseases increase drastically when lions scavenge on livestock carcasses which may have died from disease. Dogs also tend to feed on these carcasses and if they carry any infections, they can transmit them to lions.”

Chakrabarti, who has spent seven years doing fieldwork at Gir, explains that lions prey on livestock because forest patches that can support wild ungulates are too few in human-dominated landscape and livestock is the most readily available prey “This brings them in direct conflict with humans and their property. The study by the WII shows that lionesses in human-dominated landscapes need a minimum of 4 sq km of sacrosanct forest patch to rear cubs in concealment. So, for long-term persistence of lions in this landscape, it is imperative to safeguard such forest patches.”

He suggests creating more lion-safe areas, if not protected areas. “The WII’s Lion Ecology Project has delineated these patches, and some sort of legal protection should be immediately bestowed on them so that they do not get converted to agricultural land or development zones.”

Conservation that keeps humans in mind

Conservation has to keep both humans and wildlife in mind, indicates Chellam who says that conservation strategies can’t solely focus on a particular species as they don’t live in a vacuum. “If you don’t conserve and manage the entire habitat, conservation efforts are bound to fail.”

Talking about maintaining the lion’s habitat, Chakrabarti says, “Linear infrastructure, like roads and railways, in particular, should be carefully planned or diverted so that they do not intersect important habitat patches and corridors. However, building roads and railways cannot always be compromised. In such cases, underpasses should be considered.”

Asiatic lions, unlike their African counterparts, don’t view humans as immediate threats. Researchers have observed that unless provoked, starving, or approached when with cubs or while mating (in which case they tend to be more aggressive than usual), they avoid humans. This behaviour, they theorise, is a result of being nurtured by humans.

In the early 20th century, there were but a dozen lions left due to drought and excessive hunting before the then Nawab of Junagadh stepped in and decided to protect them. As a result, their numbers have risen over the years. This relationship, while astounding, is now heavily romanticised. There is no guarantee that the big cats will not hunt humans, especially if their population continues to increase in limited space.

Yadvendradev Jhala, Dean, WII, says, “The lion population is expanding to areas where they were extirpated hundreds of years ago. In these areas, people do not have the cultural tradition of living with large carnivores. The lion density is low in the larger Saurashtra landscape right now, but if this increases, livestock kills and injuries to and death of humans will increase, and people will no longer remain tolerant. Retaliation by humans will eliminate lions from the landscape.”

Mainly found in Junagadh, Amreli, Gir Somnath and Bhavnagar districts, the lions can now be spotted in at least four other districts. Chakrabarti says that coexisting is inevitable if the population keeps increasing. “It is important that sensitisation and outreach are properly done so that people learn how to share space with them.

(Sorry.) Now that we’re all still indoors and finished marathoning every episode of Tiger King (including the update) and have gossiped about it with our coworkers over Zoom until even we’re tired of ourselves saying how exactly Carol Baskin killed her husband, we need something else to do.

But are we totally ready to move on from the train wreck that is Tiger King? (No.)

Personally, I think it’s good that the majority of us are collectively consuming this media—it opens our eyes to worlds that we didn’t know existed: The cruel side of “sanctuaries” and how to discern which are truly saving animals and which are exploiting them. The lengths people go to in order to obtain money or status from animals or their parts.

Tiger King is full of animal abuse, and it’s not easy to watch. I didn’t watch it and *enjoy* it, which I believe is the case with a lot of people. I couldn’t look away from all these people arguing about who was doing the better job of keeping these wild exotic (and in many cases, endangered) animals in cages. And I was horrified.

Along those lines, I’ve found myself diving into books following characters trying to better the lives of animals or themselves, whether or not they actually succeed. I’ve chosen these specific books like Tiger King for their similarities to discussions of animals in captivity and the morality surrounding that. Some have characters totally opposite to the people in Tiger King, trying to do their best to actually provide help, and some are eerily close in that there aren’t really any good characters or people in the content, but you will not be able to stop reading. Still others are just downright weird (in a fun way).

I’ll flag each as best I can for all warnings, but please take caution and do additional research if you need. You can also donate to or support an actual nonprofit that truly works to preserve wildlife (hint: it’s none of those parks in Tiger King). Here are eight books like Tiger King that will keep your eyes glued to the page until you’re done.

But three years later, an animal factory bombing triggers a series of events that suddenly causes Tucker to reappear in the McCloud sisters’ lives, and he seeks out the friendship and help of his youngest sister, 9-year-old Cora. While Cora becomes an inadvertent road trip sidekick and accomplice, Darlene and Jane work with police to track down their missing sister. The family will have to confront their issues with the world and one another to survive the storm that tore them apart in the first place.

4th Grade, Mrs. Niki Rinker

Browns Valley Elementary

White rhinos are an endangered species which I think need to be noticed more.

There are only two left, which are heavily guarded at all times in Africa. They are both

female. To tell you a little bit about the amazing white rhino, their weight can vary from

1.6 to 4 tons! Why are they so heavy? Why, it’s all the eating they do! A typical white

rhinoceros can eat up to 120 pounds of food a day. White rhinos are herbivores. This

means their diet consists of mostly grasses with the occasional tree or bush. The scientific name for this animal is ceratotherium simum. In size, they are relative to a six foot man. Their outer horn is always bigger than the inner one, and the outer horn can grow to five feet! This precious species always avoids heat and usually is up in the early morning hours.

There is actually no difference in color between the black and white rhinoceros. They are both gray! You may ask, why? Well, the big difference is their lips. White rhinos have a square upper lip, while black rhinos have a hooked lip. Because of this, white rhinos are also sometimes called the square-lipped rhino. Even though these are big

creatures, the second largest land animal to the elephant, they can run very fast, sometimes reaching speeds of 40 miles per hour. They also have sharp hearing and a keen sense of smell. They do have hair, but only on the tip of their tail, eyelashes, and on their ears. Their head hangs low because of high shoulders.

The endangered white rhino species was brought back from the very brink of extinction. White rhinos were thought to be extinct towards the end of the 19th century,

but in 1895 a small group of under 100 were found. These animals might have been thought to be extinct due to the extreme poaching problem. These magnificent creatures were hunted for their horns which many believed that, if crushed up and drunk, the horn would provide healing powers. Obviously, this is not true, but as many believed in it, the deed was done. These horns could sell for $100,000 or more.

So are you looking for a way to make a difference in the world?

The so-called Pentecostal pastors with their huge camps lining the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway would be green with envy.

Christianity is now show business. Always has been with its promoters doing all they can to attract concertgoers who fool themselves, believing that they are adherents. Driven by the desire to rake in tithes, these pastors carry on with fake miracles, fake proclamations and services that would make promoters of Nigeria’s seedy Strip Clubs rue their competition. But they would never have contended with the light-skinned midget that has come out of Anambra screaming in very bad English that he is the Lion.

Illiterate Lion who goes with so many monikers like Liquid Metal has just turned Christianity on its head, pushing Jesus Christ to his last temptation. His services are a mix of wrestling, nightlife dancing, poorly orchestrated Nollywood scripts, badly delivered sermons and a platform for men of the underworld to display ill-gotten wealth all in the name of Christ. This Jesus has suffered. So what is the difference between this Lion and the Lions that litter the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway and all over the country with sweet-smelling suits and who speak Queens English? The Lion of Anambra and the Indaboski is a little bit better than his sophisticated colleagues in the fact that he does not take tithes but instead showers his people with money. Unlike his senior cousins who take tithes to build schools that effectively push away the tithe payers, the ‘I am that I am’ dishes out, hence his huge popularity. The Lion does not lie that he is the Servant of any God but that he himself is the Lion, believe him or not is your business. He has said his own. So you see the shame that is today’s Christianity in Nigeria but who am I to fight the Lord’s battle. Let him fight his battle as for me, I really do need more snails in my Afang."~[]

Eight weeks after the National Trust closed the historic site to restrict the spread of the coronavirus, it has been reported that wildlife has taken full advantage of the unusually empty attraction.

David Brown, National Trust ecologist at Corfe Castle, said: ""With the site the quietest it has ever been, the great curtain walls are an ideal spot for these powerful birds, which look for isolated and inaccessible places to build a nest.

""Amongst all the uncertainty it has been heartening to see nature colonising the landscape in our absence.""

The peregrine is the fastest bird – and the fastest animal – on the planet.

It can reach speeds of more than 200mph while making its high speed hunting dive, which is faster than the take off speed of a typical passenger jet and in the same ballpark as the top speed of a Porsche 911 Turbo S sports car – the fastest road legal 911 ever produced.

It can also reach horizontal cruising speeds of up to 56mph.

Purbeck National Trust engagement officer Tom Clarke said: ""We think it is likely they are attempting to breed because the castle isn’t being visited.

""We know that peregrines are doing well locally, so it could be a young pair looking for a suitable nesting site, and happened across this quiet castle.

""It’s been a lovely piece of news to share within the team and village, at a time when everything seems so bleak.""

Currently the castle remains closed to the public.

Tom said: ""We’re going to reopen the castle when Government guidelines enable us to do so, and if the nest is still active we’ll ensure visitors keep an appropriate distance from the birds as well as each other.""

Also, 27 Soay sheep have been introduced to the castle's grounds to keep the scrub down.

The new arrivals were chosen for their nimbleness on the slopes of the ruins and have the added benefit of eating and trampling bramble and ivy which could damage the ancient masonry if allowed to thrive."~[]

More than 40 chicks have fledged from the nest site at the power station, to the south-east of Dunbar, in the past 21 years, with this year’s pair successfully rearing three new chicks.

Workers are able to monitor the family’s progress on energy supplier EDF’s internal network via a webcam installed in 2009; giving a fascinating insight into how the adults care for their young.

Diana Dyce, of the company’s environmental safety group, said: “I’m normally able to see the nest through the window from my desk and watching the chicks grow each year is a real highlight.

“During nesting season this year, though, I’ve been working from home as we limit the number of people on site to manage the Covid-19 situation, so the webcam has been crucial for me and others who have wanted to keep an eye on the family.”

The grounds of the power station offer a safe haven for the birds, where they can nest undisturbed each year.

Robert Gunn, station director, said: “As the only site in East Lothian to hold the Biodiversity Benchmark, we actively encourage wildlife so it’s wonderful to see the peregrines return year after year.

“I’m delighted another three chicks look set to fledge from this successful nesting site, bringing the total for the past 21 years to 45 chicks.”

Torness has held the Wildlife Trust’s Biodiversity Benchmark award since 2015; one of four sites in Scotland and the only one in East Lothian to do so."~[]

Officers from West Yorkshire Police's Wildlife and Rural Crime team posted the appeal on social media website, Facebook, after the falcon was found dead in the centre of Brighouse.

The body was discovered on Saturday, May 23.

An X-ray was conducted on the bird and it concluded the falcon had been shot.

The peregrine falcon is the fastest bird in the world and the fastest member of the animal kingdom.

It has a diving speed of 242 mph (389 km/h).

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) says on its website: ""Peregrines were at a low point in the 1960s due to human persecution and the impact of pesticides in the food chain.

""Improved legislation and protection has helped the birds to recover and they have now expanded into many urban areas.

""However, they are still persecuted - birds are illegally killed to prevent predation on game birds and racing pigeons.""

Peregrine falcons are also covered by Schedule One, Part One of The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

It states that is is an offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb peregrine falcons, or their young, at, on or near their ""active"" nests.

A spokesperson for West Yorkshire Police said: ""Saddened to report a peregrine falcon was found dead in Brighouse centre, West Yorkshire, on May 23.

""X-ray concluded this beautiful bird, has been shot. Who did this?""

If you have any information that could help police you should ring 101, or use the contact options on the West Yorkshire Police website.

Well, an old video of this rare sight is going viral on Twitter and will be one of the most incredible things you will see today.

Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer Sudha Ramen recently shared a clip of the rare sight. She tweeted the video with the caption, ""The family that drinks together stays together. Wait to see the cinematic entry of the King. It's quite a rare sight to see a pride using a waterhole. Lions are not great lovers of water bodies unlike the tigers. Somewhere in Africa.""

According to the IFS officer, the video was first shared by Londolozi, which is one of South Africa's original private game reserves.

Take a look:

The family that drinks together stays together. Wait to see the cinematic entry of the King.

Infact it's quite rare sight to see a large pride using a waterhole. Lions are not great lovers of waterbodies unlike the tigers. Somewhere in Africa. Via Londolozi pic.twitter.com/fdo57f24GE — Sudha Ramen IFS (@SudhaRamenIFS) May 25, 2020

The clip shows a lion pride drinking at a waterhole together. After a few seconds, two lions come out of the forest and start drinking water together with the rest of the pride. Such a scene is a rare sight because lions are not great lovers of water bodies, according to the IFS officer. The clip was shot somewhere in Africa.

After the video was shared, it quickly went viral and managed to garner over 3.2k views. Twitter users also took to the comments section to talk about the uncommon sight. Here's what people are saying:

Kendrys Morales established himself as one of the greatest major league players to play in the Cuban National Series.

Kendrys Morales was considered a rookie sensation when he made his debut in the 2002 Serie Nacional with Havana’s Industriales. That season he established seven Cuban League rookie records included were those for batting average (.324), homeruns (21), and RBI’s (82).

His second year although shortened by injuries he managed to hit .391 in 254 AB and made himself a fixture on the Cuban National Team. But this experience was short-lived by the power hitter because he was sent back home and suspended by Cuban authorities for supposedly making contact with an agent in November of 2003 during the Olympic qualifiers in Panama. He never donned the jersey of the Cuban team during his career.

”That is not true, I never spoke to an agent. But this made things clear to me that I had to leave the island,” said Morales to the press in Miami shortly after his arrival in the US.

Leaving the Island

After eight failed attempts Morales finally was able to leave in June of 2004 and quickly established residency in the Dominican Republic, a country in which he has now assumed its nationality.

”I tried to leave on various occasions and kept getting caught. That’s why I ended up in jail,” quipped the slugger.

He privately held a few workouts on the Caribbean island and impressed plenty of big league teams. Later in 2004 Morales was able to sign a 6 year 3 million dollar contract with the then Anaheim Angels.

The slugger made his professional debut in the Dominican Winter League in late 2004 with the Oriental Stars.

A distinguished career

The switch hitter played 13 long years on the grand stage and retired this past season. Morales leads all players who have played in the Serie Nacional in homers with 213 and runs batted in with 740. He is third in hits with 1,289, only trailing Yunel Escobar (1,501) and Alexei Ramirez (1,387).

The slugger’s best season in the majors was 2009 when he hit .306 with 43 doubles, 34 long balls, 108 runs knocked in and slashed .355/.569/.925, finishing fifth in the MVP balloting that season in AL.

The native of Fomento ,Cuba drove in100 or more runs twice during his career and was hit 30 or more homers that same amount of times during a campaign. Although he was never selected to an all-star game he did win a silver slugger award in 2015 with the KC Royals, a season in which he also won a World Series ring.

If it wasn’t for the gruesome ankle injury he suffered during a walk off home run in 2010, who knows what he could have been. This cost him him nearly 2 1/2 seasons, if not for that terrible injury we might saying that Morales was one of the best Cuban hitters to ever grace the majors.

For a taste of international travel just about 90 minutes from La Crosse, head up to Stockholm, Wisconsin. It’s a tiny village in Pepin County on the picturesque shores of Lake Pepin. Immigrants from Sweden founded Stockholm and named it after the old country’s capital. Calling itself “a small village with big heART,” Stockholm is filled with delightful surprises.

Stockholm Pie and General Store is legendary. It’s noted as having the best pie in Wisconsin according to TastingTable.com and was named one of 18 legendary pie shops in America by USA Today. Shoppers will appreciate the many boutiques with handmade items from personal accessories to Amish furniture, fashionable apparel, handcrafts, and art. Stop by Ingebretsen’s Nordic Marketplace for authentic Scandinavian gifts.

Laura Ingalls Wilder fans will want to drive about six miles more to nearby Pepin, where the Little House on the Prairie author was born. A museum, a replica of the Little House in the Big Woods, a covered wagon, and related items fill the scene. You’ll be surrounded by beautiful fall foliage in the area. If you want something more, visit Maiden Rock Bluff State Natural Area to see gorgeous views from the natural lookout. If you’re lucky, you may see a peregrine falcon, bald eagle, or other raptors in the area."~[]

An estimated 25 international tour players will need to get to the U.S. in the next week and quarantine for 14 days if they want to play in the Charles Schwab Challenge set for June 11-14 at Colonial in Fort Worth, Texas.

“Professional sporting events provide much needed economic benefits, but equally important, they provide community pride and national unity,” acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf wrote. “In today’s environment, Americans need their sports. It’s time to reopen the economy and it’s time we get our professional athletes back to work.”

World No. 10 Tommy Fleetwood and veteran Lee Westwood have said they will not return for the tour’s restart, citing the 14 day quarantine required on both ends of the trip as a deciding factor.

“It’s six weeks for two tournaments, and to me that’s just not worth it,” Lee Westwood said to the Golf Channel. “And it’s not worth taking the risk if everybody thinks that those kind of precautions have got to be in place. I don’t feel like golf’s a priority if it’s that severe.”

Adam Scott also plans to stay put in Australia and miss the tour’s restart.

RYDER CUP CAPTAIN WOODS?

Tiger Woods has taken quite a shine to team golf in recent years and now Kevin Na has added fuel to rumours that the 15-time major champ will captain the Americans at the 2022 Ryder Cup in Italy.

Na was speaking to Sky Sports when he said his goal was to make this 2020 team and also the 2022 team because he heard Woods would be captain.

“I heard rumours. Am I starting a rumour? That’s what I heard,” Na told the British sports network. “Am I not supposed to say anything? I don’t know, I’ve heard rumours. I won’t tell you who I heard them from, but it wasn’t from him. It was from one of his friends.”

This year’s Ryder Cup is set for September at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin, but could still be pushed back a year due to COVID-19.

CHIP SHOTS

Expect to see some LPGA players carrying their own clubs when the world’s top women’s tour gets back on the course.

The tour has made caddies optional when play resumes later this summer. The reason for the change isn’t financial but a matter of safety. More players on the LPGA Tour rely on week-to-week locals rather than full-time caddies. The tour felt players might feel uncomfortable working with relative strangers during these times … Tiger, Phil and the quarterbacks wasn’t the only charity game going on this Sunday. Rolex world No. 1 Jin Young Ko and No. 3 Sung Hyun Park played the Hyundai Card charity skins game at Sky 72 Golf & Resort in Incheon, South Korea. The players split the skins and each raised approximately $56,000 CDN for charities of their choice."~[]

A review recently published in Crime Science suggests that animal poaching and the illicit wildlife trade concentrate in a similar manner to more traditional crime categories. Further, authors propose that the field of conservation biology would be well-served by borrowing prevention strategies, approaches to modeling and interventions commonly utilized in crime science.

Much of the empirical research that touches on wildlife crime has originated from conservation biology—not surprisingly, as this area of inquiry pertains to species populations and protected area management. However, crime scientists are seeking a more substantial role in conservation.

In a review recently published in Crime Science, Justin Kurland from the University of Waikato and colleagues considered the following: if various forms of wildlife crime are concentrated like traditional crime categories, then strategies adopted for crime prevention may be effective at preventing particular types of wildlife crime.

Crime typically concentrates in a small number of places, or crime ‘hotspots,’ and among other units of analysis, including victims, routes, facilities, products and time Don’t like ads? Become a supporter and enjoy The Good Men Project ad free

Crime concentration

The criminology of place research has found that crime typically concentrates in a small number of places or crime ‘hotspots.’ Crime also concentrates among other units of analysis, including victims, routes, facilities, products and time. This empirical base suggests underlying reasons for why crime clusters in a variety of ways, while offering spatially explicit preventive interventions that seek to mitigate future crime.

Illegal wildlife poaching and trade cluster like traditional crimes

The authors found evidence that various forms of wildlife crime concentrate in space, time, among products, routes, and at particular facilities. In the case of wildlife crime, ‘products’ refer to animals, plants, or their constituent parts.

For example, studies conducted in 2007 and 2008 applied innovative DNA assignment methods to large seizures of ivory en route to Asia in order to identify the geographic origins of elephant poaching. Results indicated that seized ivory emanated from specific areas in Africa, leading the researchers to conclude that elephant poaching is spatially concentrated. Similarly, another study found only a few sub-Saharan African countries accounted for a disproportionately high number of elephant losses between 1979 and 2007.

In Kruger National Park, South Africa, 90 per cent of all rhino poaching incidents occurred within 2.5km of a road. Similar recurrent temporal patterns were also identified, across seasons and during the day, for both parrot and deer poaching.

Findings from several studies conducted on the illicit trade of wildlife and wildlife products suggest that a small number of export countries account for the majority of wildlife seizures entering the U.S., that a small number of entry points seize a disproportionate amount of wildlife contraband, and are temporally concentrated with significantly more seizures occurring at particular times of the year.

Situational crime prevention

Approaches to mitigate traditional crimes, such as Situational Crime Prevention (SCP), may be effective for reducing various forms of wildlife crime. SCP aims to reduce opportunities through five crime prevention mechanisms:

Approaches to mitigate traditional crimes may be effective for reducing various forms of wildlife crime as well

making it harder,

less rewarding,

riskier to commit crime,

reducing provocations,

removing excuses.

Poaching: Making it riskier, increasing the effort, and reducing excuses

Protected areas have had some degree of success by increasing the effort and by removing excuses. More specifically, poaching can be more difficult by controlling access to, and screening exits from, protected areas as well as by deflecting offenders through the use of physical barriers such as electrified fencing. Excuses are removed through setting rules, informing local people and assisting compliance by improving the livelihood of local communities.

Findings from the literature suggest that the combination of these two is optimal for the prevention of poaching. In addition, there have been a number of cash rewards systems for patrol rangers that aspire to increase patrol effort through monetary incentives, which in turn should increase the risk for poachers who will be more likely to meet capable guardians in time and space.

Retaliatory killing, a form of human-animal conflict, typically occurs when wildlife destroy crops, consume livestock, or kill people

Retaliatory killing: Reducing provocations

The creation of fenced enclosures and the strategic placement of fence barriers are meant to reduce provocations between animals and neighboring communities. This is commonly referred to as ‘human-animal’ conflict in the conservation literature and this measure attempts to decrease the likelihood of retaliatory killing, which typically occurs when wildlife destroys crops, consume livestock, or kill people. Typically, wire, chain-link, or electrified fences are used, especially with elephants, to prevent this particular brand of wildlife crime.

Further studies have found that in addition to reducing retaliatory killings of lions in Africa, the fences provide a better environment for lion population growth and poaching. For example, findings indicate fenced areas hold African lion populations significantly closer to their maximum population potential than unfenced areas, while populations in nearly half of the unfenced areas decreased and were projected to go extinct in the next 20-40 years.

Evaluating effectiveness

Unfortunately, the general lack of impact and outcome evaluations of programs, policies and interventions has hindered the authors’ understanding of what works, and what might work in different contexts. Authors urge for increased collaboration between crime scientists and conservationists in the future.

Whether studying tiger poaching behavior in a protected area in India or conducting a port-level analysis of wildlife contraband trafficking patterns, the authors say, evaluation needs to and should be, integrated into the overall design of a study when prevention is the objective.

Hyderabad: A lone tiger looking for territory has forced mining companies and forest department officials to work together -- a rather rare occurrence -- in Adilabad district of Telangana.

A three-year-old male tiger from Maharashtra, most likely in search of territory, was spotted several times near the Khairaguru open cast coal mine. The forest department communicated with the Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL), which owns the mine, to ensure no harm comes to the tiger.

The company embraced the challenge of having a tiger around its mines and even stopped some of its night operations in the past three weeks or so to ensure the tiger gets some peace and room to go on its way.

“We are actually delighted to have a tiger on our land. For us this is a validation of our afforestation activities on overburden deposits (soil, rock etc that lies above a coal seam or ore body) on which we have grown tens of thousands of trees. These overburden ‘hills’ are now like proper forests and we are happy that a tiger believes it can move around in this area,” a senior SCCL official told Deccan Chronicle.

According to Kawal tiger reserve field director C.P. Vinod Kumar, it is very likely that the tiger is attempting to cross the mining area and move towards the reserve. “We asked SCCL officials to help us keep the animal safe. They responded positively and are taking steps based on our advice to keep the tiger safe,” Kumar said.

The presence of the tiger came to light from videos shot by SCCL workers and posted on social media sites. Forest officials though have been tracking the tiger since the beginning of this month when it entered the state. “Three teams of foresters are working in shifts round the clock and keeping track of the tiger. We hope it will find its way to the forests near Kawal soon,” Kumar said.

Following a request from the forest department, SCCL has urged its staff not to film the tiger if they come across it. “We also advised them not to share any pictures of the animal anymore. We also suspended some night operations when asked to do so to allow the tiger to move freely near the mines,” an SSCL official said.

SCCL has also put the brakes on its huge dumper trucks with capacities ranging from 35 to 60 tonnes each, to prevent a possible accident.

“The forest officials requested that we cut down speeds. Since we cannot put speed breakers on the roads, we came up with a different solution,” the SCCL official said. A number of 200 litre metal drums were rolled out and set up asy barricades on the roads that run in and out of the mines to slow down the trucks.

“It is not just us officials. Even our staff is delighted to have a tiger amidst us. They are very excited but are also being careful as we are cautioning them regularly that though it is a fascinating animal, if it is disturbed, it may turn on people. We do not want a conflict situation and we too hope that it will safely move to a forest area,” the SCCL official said.

Tiger Woods and his famed Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS. Getty Images

Tiger Woods rarely (if ever) goes out of his way to point out changes to his equipment setup. Some changes are a little bit easier to notice — like changing drivers or irons — while others fly completely under the radar until they’re eventually unearthed. Woods’ gear setup is a real-life version of “Where’s Waldo.” You never know when you’re going to find a fresh tweak.

The latest adjustment is a perfect example. With three months in between starts — if you can call last weekend’s Match II win over Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady a “start” — Woods took the downtime to get his famed Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS putter checked out by Cameron before the Match II.

Due to the sheer number of putts Woods hits on a regular basis, he wanted the loft and lie checked to confirm nothing had changed. With the putter already in Cameron’s shop, Woods also had the iconic “cherry bomb” in the cavity refilled with red paint.

For those unfamiliar with the red dot, it’s part of what makes Tiger’s putter “The Scotty.” Located in the cavity and heel of the putter, the dot was popularized by Woods, who started using a Newport 2 GSS in 1999 at the then-GTE Byron Nelson Classic.

As the story goes, prior to shipping the putter for Woods to test, Cameron noticed the head weight was too heavy by two swing-weight points, which led him to mill a dot in the back cavity and another in the heel of the face to get the preferred weight. Red paint was then applied to give it a striking look. The cherry bomb is not only found on Woods’ putter but countless retail products from Cameron.

Woods’ red dot had been missing from the cavity since the 2019 Open Championship when he concealed it behind multiple strips of lead tape to handle the slow greens at Royal Portrush. When Woods went to remove the tape after the event, it took the red paint with it, leaving the 15-time major winner with a putter that no longer featured its signature calling card.

Woods is still Superman with or without the cape, but the return of the cherry bomb to his famed putter was a welcomed sight at Medalist. Does it provide any performance benefit? Of course not. Then again, we’re talking about arguably the most important club in the history of professional golf. Any alteration (even a minor one) is big news in the gear world."~[]

And forests cover 96 percent of its roughly 40,000 hectares. [Photo provided to China Daily]

CHENGDU－Birds sing in chorus to announce morning's arrival in the Tangjiahe National Nature Reserve in Southwest China's Sichuan province.

The reserve takes its name from the small Tangjia River, which snakes through the reserve and flows into a tributary of the Yangtze, China's longest river.

It hosts over 3,700 species of flora and fauna. And forests cover 96 percent of its roughly 40,000 hectares.

But the area was desolate wasteland years ago.

Tangjiahe's transformation has come to the spotlight as China observes the International Day for Biological Diversity on Friday.

Historically, people living in the area depended on the mountains to make a living.

They hunted animals and logged trees. A logging operation was established there in 1965.

Over 1,000 workers cut down almost 30,000 cubic meters of wood a year to support the country's construction work.

But the logging and poaching devastated Tangjiahe's ecosystem.

""The animals just ran way,"" says Pu Youhai, an elderly resident who used to hunt in the wilderness.

""At that time, you had to go to places that were very high and very far to find game.""

But that changed in 1975, when local officials decided that the situation needed to be addressed and applied to designate the area as a nature reserve to conserve its rare wildlife.

The reserve's construction was completed three years later, and logging ceased.

In 1983, it built an observation station for giant pandas, making it the second of its kind at that time.

Many seasoned experts came to Tangjiahe to track, monitor and research pandas, which provided valuable data to advance the protection of the animals and their habitats.

In 1985, hundreds of villagers from the heartland were relocated to make space for rare plants and animals, such as pandas.

Since Tangjiahe's wild pandas live in groups, China had included the reserve in its pilot national giant panda park that broke ground in 2016. It hosts 39 wild pandas, a national survey says.

Ma Wenhu has been patrolling the reserve for over 20 years.

Many animals under state protection have returned to Tangjiahe, including Chinese monal pheasants, golden pheasants and blood pheasants, the 51-year-old says.

""I can distinguish among the sounds of more than 100 types of birds,"" he says.

Ma always takes a camera on patrol.

In 2014, he captured the image of a wild otter, which is under second-class state protection. It was the first time that a wild otter was caught on camera in the country since 2000.

That year, Tangjiahe was included in the International Union for Conservation of Nature Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas. The reserve furthered protection by compiling a textbook about the environment and built seven natural science museums. About 5,000 students from middle and primary schools visited Tangjiahe last year.

Green development has allowed locals to live in harmony with the environment.

Local authorities have pooled funds to help build rural cooperatives in such sectors as beekeeping and fruit cultivation.

""I've raised scores of beehives,"" says villager Yang Tingxiu.

""We can make up to 70,000 yuan ($9,822) more every year thanks to the apiaries.""

The 54-year-old also runs a family inn. The household can earn more than 100,000 yuan a year.

In Yinping village, a few kilometers from the reserve, more than 100 family inns have sprung up, offering local delicacies and accommodation.

""Almost every household has entered the family-inn business,"" says village official Luo Chengpeng.

Deng Xiaofeng opened the village's first family inn 14 years ago.

She has 32 guestrooms after expanding. Last year, her business brought in over 200,000 yuan.

""The environment is getting better. And our lives are getting better,"" she says."~[]

At 0605 GMT, the rand traded at 17.4700 per dollar, 0.91% firmer than its previous close.

The currency was at its strongest since March 27.

“The optimistic recovery narrative is holding within markets, keeping the dollar subdued and seeing the rand remain on a stable footing following last week’s rally,” Bianca Botes, executive director at Peregrine Treasury Solutions, said in a note.

“While there are looming geopolitical risks, it seems as though markets are currently pushing them onto the back burner, and will likely continue to do so until there is a new escalation or increased threat.”

Japan’s decision to end coronavirus-induced restrictions and a survey showing German business morale rebounded in May lifted hopes of an economic recovery and helped offset a war of words between Beijing and Washington on trade, coronavirus and China’s proposals for stricter security laws in Hong Kong.

In South Africa, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday a further easing of the country’s lockdown from June 1, allowing the vast majority of the economy to return to full capacity.

The government was due to give more details on Tuesday. (Reporting by Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo; Editing by Mark Potter)"~[]

rand touching a two-month high, as hopes of economic recovery and more stimulus helped investors look past U.S.-China trade tensions.

With many markets returning from a long weekend, MSCI’s index of developing-market shares rose 1.3%. Its currency counterpart gained for the sixth session in seven as increasing risk appetite weakened the dollar.

Chinese blue-chip stocks rose 1.1%, bolstered by a central bank pledge to strengthen economic policy and continue to push lower interest rates on loans. The yuan was flat.

Recovering from Friday’s steep losses, Hong Kong stocks built on Monday’s gains to post their best day in seven-weeks, up 2%.

Investors were watching for U.S. action after it warned China of new sanctions as Beijing went ahead with a new national security law on Hong Kong.

“While there are looming geopolitical risks, it seems as though markets are currently pushing them onto the back burner, and will likely continue to do so until there is a new escalation or increased threat,” said Bianca Botes, executive director at Peregrine Treasury Solutions.

More business activities restarted after coronavirus-induced lockdowns. India will attempt to resume domestic flights this week, while easing restrictions in South Africa allowed much of the economy to return to capacity.

Elsewhere, reports said Germany hopes to end a travel warning in June for trips to 31 European countries. Data on Monday showed improving business confidence in Germany, reinforcing hopes that further easing of restrictions would help the global economy emerge from what is expected to be a deep recession.

Stock indexes across central and eastern Europe, along with Russia and South Africa, rallied between 0.3% and 1.8%.

Oil prices rose on hopes of an output cut, helping Russia’s rouble climb nearly 1% against the dollar even as the country reported a surge in new coronavirus cases. Russia’s energy ministry said it sees global oil markets balancing in June.

South Africa’s rand jumped 1.2% after two days of losses. Data showed the central bank composite leading business- cycle indicator rose by 0.7% month on month in March.

Markets in Turkey were closed for a holiday.

— When word got around on Peaks Island, Maine, over the weekend that a big purple jelly fish had washed up at Centennial Beach, the Ivers family had to check it out.

“We put all three of our kids next to it and it was still bigger than all three of our kids,” mom Danielle Ivers told WBTS.

Known as the lion’s mane jellyfish, the species has grown from a normal dinner plate size to up to four or five feet in diameter in Southern New England and Maine just in the last few years, according to biologist Nick Record of Bigelow Labs.

“Over the last couple of years, the lion’s mane jellyfish have been getting startlingly large,” he said.

Record says thinks there has to be an environmental condition that makes lion’s mane jellyfish vary in size. However, he says it’s difficult to study jellyfish because they can appear and disappear for long periods of time, making it difficult to sustain funding for research.

To help, Record created a citizen jellyfish reporting system. You can email jellyfish sightings to jellyfish@bigelow.org or tweet them with the hashtag #MaineJellies. Please include date, time, and location, as well as any descriptive information such as size or type.

Record cautions that jellyfish should be admired at a safe distance from humans, even on land, saying they may still be able to sting when they’re dead.

“It can be really painful,” he says. “In some cases, if you’re stung really badly there can be medical issues.”"~[]

WACO, Texas (CN) — Federal prosecutors announced Tuesday that an Irish man accused of trafficking endangered black rhinoceros horns from Texas to New York City was extradited to the Lone Star State.

John Slattery, of Rathkeale, Ireland, appeared Tuesday before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey C. Manske in Waco federal court, four days after he was extradited from Ireland. A federal grand jury indicted the County Limerick man in 2014 on one count of conspiracy to commit wildlife trafficking, one count of illegal wildlife trafficking and one count of falsifying wildlife documentation in violation of the Lacey Act.

Tuesday’s indictment describes Slattery’s alleged purchase of one black rhinoceros mount from a taxidermist in Joshua, Texas, for $10,000 in 2010. It claims he then went to a separate taxidermy auction house in Austin and tried to buy a black rhinoceros head containing two more horns but was unable to produce the required Texas resident identification. Prosecutors say such identification would prove the sale would not be an interstate sale in violation of the Endangered Species Act.

Slattery, who is described in other court papers as belonging to a gang of Irish Travelers called the Rathkeale Rovers, allegedly used an unidentified “day laborer” as a straw buyer to get around the Texas resident requirement in September 2010. Europol has accused the Rovers gang of a conspiracy to plunder tens of millions of dollars worth of rhino horn and other priceless Chinese artifacts from British museums.

“Straw Buyer provided his Texas driver’s license to an employee of the Texas Auction House and handed the employee $18,000 in cash in exchange for a Black rhinoceros mount, which held two horns,” the 13-page indictment states. “The remainder of the rhinoceros mount, minus the horns, was left at the Texas Auction House.”

Prosecutors claim Slattery completed the sale of four horns to an unidentified buyer at a tea house in Queens, New York, for $50,000. They claim he, co-defendant Patrick Sheridan, and Michael Slattery, Jr., gave the buyer “a false and fictitious Endangered Species Bill of Sale, dated August 14, 2010, for ‘2 Black rhinoceros mounts’ and bearing a ‘U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’ emblem.”

Slattery and Sheridan allegedly left the U.S. on Nov. 16, 2010 — the same day they were paid the $50,000. They allegedly retrieved the four horns from a Missouri auction house one month later.

Sheridan was extradited from the UK in 2015 and pleaded guilty before serving 14 months in federal prison. Slattery Jr. pleaded guilty in 2014 and was sentenced to 14 months.

Slattery is scheduled to be arraigned on June 2.

The black rhinoceros is noted for having a hooked lip that differentiates it from the square-lipped white rhinoceros. A native of eastern and southern Africa, the black rhinoceros is considered critically endangered due to strong demand for its horns, which are used in folk remedies in Asia, particularly in China and Vietnam. Approximately 1,215 were poached in 2014 and 1,054 were poached in 2016 — figures the World Wildlife Fund describes as “unsustainably high.”"~[]

Waller, a native of Kalispell, is one of six UM students to receive a Fulbright Scholarship this year. The recipients continue UM’s legacy of securing Fulbright Scholarships, said Clint Walker, the UM Fulbright adviser and an associate professor of Russian.

“We had a 50% success rate this year,” Walker said. “This percentage is well above the national average and speaks to the high quality of our UM applicants for Fulbrights.”

The Fulbright U.S. Student Program offers opportunities for students and young professionals to undertake international graduate study, advanced research, university teaching and primary and secondary school teaching worldwide.

Waller will conduct research in the Russian Far East, testing new ways to monitor prey species of Amur (Siberian) tigers to foster tiger conservation.

“Specifically, I’m comparing new methods for estimating prey population size using camera traps, developed recently here at UM by my fellow graduate student Anna Moeller, with traditional Russian snow tracking techniques,” Waller said.

Because of COVID-19, the Fulbright program has been postponed until later this year or January 2021, but when Waller does go overseas, he will be based in a small village called Terney on the coast of the Sea of Japan.

“The village is surrounded by the Sikhote-Alin Biosphere Reserve, a stronghold for the Amur tiger population,” Waller said. “Russian scientists have conducted research there on Amur tiger ecology since the reserve’s formation in 1935 and have worked closely with the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Russia Program during the last quarter-century to protect this flagship species.”

Waller, whose parents are both alumni of UM’s Wildlife Biology program, said he wants to continue working as a wildlife biologist in international conservation.

“The global community needs to work together to solve our global conservation problems, even when the political situation is tense,” he said. “The relationship between the Sikhote-Alin Reserve and Wildlife Conservation Society is a great example of this, and I’m lucky to be able to work with and learn from them.”

Debbie Banks, who has spent more than two decades trying to crack down on big cat crime with the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA), believes Carole Baskin and her sanctuary’s goals were pure. She claimed that Joe Exotic’s was not as noble as he claimed because his tiger breeding efforts had “nothing to do with conservation” and were solely for profit. The EIA investigator believes they should not be kept in caged facilities because it turns them into “tiger-shaped animals” that possess “none of the qualities of wild tigers”. Ms Banks told Express.co.uk: “It’s all about profit, breeding in these facilities has no other reason than to have cubs for visitors to play with.

“Breeding tigers in the US has zero conservation, unless they are part of international stud books. “It’s absolute nonsense, the tragedy is the number of people in the US who have been fooled by the idea that these facilities contribute to conservation.” Ms Banks claimed that the decision to breed white tiger cubs highlighted Joe Exotic’s commitment to profit rather than helping to increase population sizes. She told Express.co.uk: “There is a bizarre obsession with white tigers – likely because they are rare but they are more of a logical representation of bad genes.

“They are rare in the wild because their pigmentation is caused by a recessive gene that is a result of inbreeding. “There are no scientific institutions that would promote breeding specifically for white tigers.” Ms Banks claimed to have met Carole Baskin “a couple of times” but stated that she had been involved in efforts to clampdown on big cat facilities. She added: “[Her] desire is for there to be no more pet tigers, tigers in roadside petting zoos and other inappropriate places. DON'T MISS

Symbio Wildlife Park will reopen on Monday with some changes to guard against the spread of coronavirus. Management of the popular facility at Helensburgh, where kids can get up close and personal with the animals, made the announcement in a Facebook post on Wednesday. The response was quick, with comments such as ""Ohhhh best news ever"", ""Woo hoo!!"" and ""That's great news, my kids have been waiting to do their red panda experience they got for Christmas"". The park's animals range from koalas, kangaroos, echidnas, wombats and dingoes to reptiles and tigers, red pandas, cheetahs, ring-tailed lemurs, meerkats and monkeys. Last weekend, the state government gave the go-ahead for zoos, aquariums and wildlife parks across NSW to reopen from June 1, provided they developed a COVID-19 safety plan that addressed measures in the NSW Health check-list. Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello said, ""Zoos and wildlife parks are very experienced at managing people, and they will need to ensure patrons are aware of their responsibilities and what they need to do to have a fun and safe day"". Symbio Wildlife Park said: ""We are thrilled to announce that as of Monday 1 June, we will once again be opening our doors to welcome you all back, with a few tweaks and changes to keep us all safe. ""To help us look after you as efficiently as possible we are requesting all visitors jump online to www.symbiozoo.com.au and pre-purchase your tickets before arrival. ""For all our existing season passes, gift voucher and pre-purchase experience holders, you'll be pleased to know we are automatically extending the expiration dates for the length of period we were closed. ""Throughout this time our advanced cleaning procedures will continue and general admission and park access will return 7 days a week from 9.30am - 5pm. ""We cannot thank you enough for the continued support, and can't wait to welcome you all back to come and relax as you reconnect with family and friends and enjoy the fresh air with the company of the wonderful animals and their keepers here at Symbio. ""If you have been sick, have flu-like symptoms, or have come into contact with someone who has, we ask that you take some time to relax and recoup, and we would love to have you visit when you are feeling 100%. It will make your experience far more enjoyable.""

for a sign.

Back in January, I had thought about doing a city of Reading Big Year Bird Count but didn’t know whether I wanted to commit myself to such an extensive undertaking.

I had a precedent.

In 2004 I undertook the project with fellow birder Ken Lebo as my coach and found 131 species.

I didn’t think I could top that one, especially knowing the time commitment it took to accomplish – three or four hours a day during the peak seasons.

Plus I wouldn’t have my former coach as Ken and his family moved to Ohio last year.

On a chilly Sunday afternoon, I went for a walk at Angelica Creek Park and decided that if I found a good bird, I would do the count.

As if on cue as I looked up the Angelica Creek, a Winter Wren popped up and flitted among the underbrush.

Darn, I thought. That’s a good bird.

So it began.

Even though the coronavirus lockdown has negatively impacted all of our lives, it has given me the time to pursue the Reading count, abiding by all the social distancing requirements.

And it will give all of us an opportunity to slow down and watch nature unfold for us as we navigate this pandemic.

Reading is blessed with a variety of habitats that support bird life – from the Schuylkill River through Penn Square up to the top of Mount Penn at the Pagoda.

The Schuylkill River Trail through the city is a productive walk from Heritage Park to Stonecliff.

The trail between the Penn Street and Buttonwood Street bridges was a particularly surprising spot early in the spring as it yielded at least seven pairs of Wood Ducks, two Buffleheads, several Common Mergansers, a dozen Double-crested Cormorants and a Pied-billed Grebe along with Mallards and Black Ducks.

Penn Square is the home turf of the downtown Reading Peregrine Falcons, and we can look for a falcon perched atop the cross of Christ Episcopal Church at Fifth and Court streets.

Duryea Drive to the Pagoda offers a variety of bird life from migrating warblers to nesting forest dwellers like Wood Thrush, Veery and the abundant Rufous-sided Towhee.

The Bridle Path below the Pagoda has been a favorite haunt for Hermit Thrushes in the early spring and is home to a number of woodpecker species including Downy, Hairy and Red-bellied woodpeckers along with Northern Flickers. We can also see or hear one of the most spectacular birds of the woodlands – the Pileated Woodpecker.

Skyline Drive from the Pagoda to Drenkel Field was a warbler hot spot in the spring and also produced Rose-breasted Grosbeak and Great-crested Flycatcher against a chorus of Gray Catbirds.

The same area will be a good place to view migrating raptors in the fall and will once again host warblers on their journey south.

At any place in the city we can look up and find turkey and black vultures riding the thermals or Red-tailed Hawks soaring.

The 18th Ward, home to Angelica Creek Park, is also a city birding hotspot with an abundance of Tree Swallows, American Goldfinches, Red-Winged Blackbirds and Indigo Buntings.

A walk up the Rose Valley Creek from Pendora Park through Mineral Spring Park to Egelman Park is always good for bird life.

Occasionally, we may witness a bird drama unfold.

On April 23, I watched on the Schuylkill River near Fritz’s Island as an immature Bald Eagle – perhaps a second-year bird- swooped down on a small raft of Canada geese with talons extended. The geese and a pair of mallards tightened up and flapped their wings to keep the eagle at bay.

The eagle made at least two passes over the raft before flying up to a sycamore, undoubtedly frustrated by its failure in the hunt.

About fifteen minutes later while walking along the trail, I saw both the immature and an adult Bald Eagle fly off together up the river.

It wasn’t a bird that fascinated me on March 9, but a nest.

Along the river, I found an old Common Raven’s nest in the girders underneath the railroad bridge north of the Buttonwood Street Bridge.

The presence of Ravens in the city is a remarkable occurrence, but nesting Ravens is even moreso.

A pair nested five years ago under a similar bridge in the city, but this one was more recent although abandoned.

I saw and heard a Raven fly over the river trail and have seen and heard Ravens on Mount Penn and in east Reading.

Watching birds in Reading doesn’t take an all-out commitment.

It can be as easy as looking up.

Or looking out a window.

Right now, city residents can attract birds to their backyards by simply putting water out for them.

We have a birdbath in our east Reading yard that has attracted Catbirds and House Finches.

It’s always fascinating to walk out the front door and listen for the neighborhood birds first thing in the morning.

And we can all enjoy the aerial acrobatics of the Chimney Swifts that make Reading their summer homes.

As of the end of May, I’ve found 101 species of birds in the city, which I list below.

I wonder what bird surprises the city will give me throughout the rest of the year.

Follow me on Facebook to find out.

SAN FRANCISCO, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 28, 2020 / Jaguar Health, Inc. (JAGX) (""Jaguar"" or the ""Company"") announced today that it has submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) what the Company expects is the final major regulatory filing to support approval of its oral plant-based drug candidate Canalevia™ (crofelemer delayed-release tablets) to treat chemotherapy-induced diarrhea (CID) in dogs.

According to current estimates, more than 230,000 dogs in the U.S. receive chemotherapy treatment for various cancers each year, and roughly one in four will experience diarrhea as a side effect of treatment. There currently is no FDA-approved anti-secretory prescription product to manage this debilitating diarrhea in dogs.

The filing consists of an updated version of the Target Animal Safety technical section of Jaguar's application for conditional approval of Canalevia for CID under the Minor Use/Minor Species (MU/MS) section of The Minor Use and Minor Species Animal Health Act of 2004.

""With this filing, which includes new administrative details, we are confident that CVM will deem our Target Animal Safety technical section Complete,"" said Dr. Michael Guy, DVM, Ph.D., Jaguar's vice president of preclinical and nonclinical studies.

As previously announced, the technical section contains data from a 2017 safety study indicating that the NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect level) of Canalevia in dogs is approximately six times greater than previously demonstrated, and that Canalevia also is safe for use in puppies as young as 12 weeks of age.

In addition to CID, Jaguar also is seeking conditional approval to market Canalevia for exercise-induced diarrhea (EID) in dogs. ""We are leveraging many of the same major technical sections from our CID submission for the proposed EID indication,"" Dr. Guy said. ""We expect that Canalevia could be available under conditional approval to treat both CID and EID in the first half of 2021.""

""Jaguar is now one important step closer to having our first approved medicine for use in animals,"" said Jaguar president and chief executive officer Lisa Conte. ""We believe Canalevia will be an important treatment option for the 50,000 dogs that suffer from CID each year. And once CID is under control, dogs may better tolerate their chemotherapy.""

Jaguar's wholly owned subsidiary, Napo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (""Napo""), currently markets Mytesi®, another form of crofelemer, for the treatment of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patients with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy. Crofelemer comes from the Croton lechleri tree, which is responsibly and sustainably harvested in South America.

Napo is pursuing the development of Mytesi to treat cancer therapy-related diarrhea in humans. Conte said that dogs undergoing chemotherapy are an important predictive model for crofelemer's mechanism of action in humans experiencing diarrhea as a result of their cancer treatment.

As previously announced, the CVM has confirmed the completeness of Jaguar's Reasonable Expectation of Effectiveness technical section for CID under MU/MS, as well as the CMC (Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls) and Environmental Impact technical sections of the Company's applications for conditional approval of Canalevia for both CID and EID.

About Mytesi®

Mytesi (crofelemer) is an antidiarrheal indicated for the symptomatic relief of noninfectious diarrhea in adult patients with HIV/AIDS on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Mytesi is not indicated for the treatment of infectious diarrhea. Rule out infectious etiologies of diarrhea before starting Mytesi. If infectious etiologies are not considered, there is a risk that patients with infectious etiologies will not receive the appropriate therapy and their disease may worsen. In clinical studies, the most common adverse reactions occurring at a rate greater than placebo were upper respiratory tract infection (5.7%), bronchitis (3.9%), cough (3.5%), flatulence (3.1%), and increased bilirubin (3.1%).

Tiger King on Netflix has been stealing all the headlines, with its crazed tales of 'big cat' owners in the States.

It highlighted the startling statistic that there are more big cats in private ownership in the US than in the wild. It was against this backdrop that I set out on safari to see them in their natural Kenyan habitat.

My trip coincided with the 35th anniversary of the release of the Oscar-winning timeless classic, Out Of Africa, based on the memoir of the Danish travel writer Karen Blixen. It stars Meryl Streep as Blixen and Robert Redford, as her aristocratic lover Denys Finch Hatton.

A pride of lions in the Maasai Mara. Lions can sleep for up to 20 hours a day, Frank learned on his safari

Tiger King on Netflix highlighted the startling statistic that there are more big cats in private ownership in the US than in the wild. It was against this backdrop that Frank set out on safari to see them in their natural Kenyan habitat

Deborah Calmeyer, the dynamic founder of the ultra-luxe travel specialist Roar Africa arranged a special five-day Out of Africa Tour. The firm organised Robert Redford's first return trip to Africa, so if it was good enough for a Hollywood legend, my girlfriend and I were happy to follow in his footsteps.

Kenya, or British East Africa as it was known at the turn of the 20th century, was Karen Blixen's idea of paradise. She describes moving there in her memoir, Out of Africa, at a time when British and other European colonial land-owners held dominion over vast estates populated with vast numbers of Big Five animals - leopards, rhinos, buffaloes, lions and elephants.

Safari (from the Arabic word meaning 'journey') in Blixen's time, was more associated with big game hunting, a then popular pursuit among the bored and promiscuous aristocratic class, as portrayed in the under-rated British film, White Mischief.

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING ERNEST

The Hemingways Nairobi hotel. Frank describes the hotel as 'a gentle introduction to Africa'

Two kilometres from the Hemingways Nairobi hotel, pictured, is the compact Karen Blixen Museum where the great writer lived for over a decade

Frank's trip to Africa coincided with the 35th anniversary of the release of the Oscar-winning timeless classic Out Of Africa, starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford

Danish travel writer Karen Blixen, whose memoir, Out of Africa, became an Oscar-winning movie

Ernest Hemingway famously embarked on a three-month big game hunt in Kenya, which inspired him to write The Snows of Kilimanjaro and The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber.

So it seemed appropriate that the first overnight stop on our trip was the Hemingways Nairobi hotel in the garden city of Nairobi.

'Jambo' meaning hello is a Swahili greeting I would never tire of hearing over the course of the trip and it's always delivered with a smile and a warm Kenyan welcome.

A beautiful airy hotel with lush gardens, Hemingways is a gentle introduction to Africa. We arrived just in time for the bottomless brunch with a Jazz Band playing to a mostly local African upmarket clientele.

The hotel is located in the foothills of the evocatively named Ngong Hills ('Ngong' is taken from the Maasai phrase meaning 'rhinoceros spring').

Two kilometres from the hotel is the compact Karen Blixen Museum where the great writer lived for over a decade. 'I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Ngong Hills' are the opening words from Out of Africa, full of yearning.

Among other accomplishments, Blixen was a talented portrait painter and her work hangs on the walls, alongside black-and-white photos of her sipping Champagne with Arthur Miller and Marilyn Monroe, and Blixen's well-worn Louis Vuitton travel cases.

'In the highlands,' Blixen wrote, 'you woke up in the morning and thought: Here I am, where I ought to be.'

These highlands are the misty Ngong Hills, and it's where her lover, Denys Finch-Hatton, a big game hunter, was buried over 10 miles away. Blixen placed a white sheet over his tomb so that she could wake up and see it from her garden and grieve.

SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR OVER THE MAASAI MARA

The breathtaking safari lodge Angama Mara. The name of lodge is inspired by the Swahili word for 'suspended in mid-air'

Next up was an hour-long charter flight to a breathtaking safari lodge, Angama Mara. As the plane swept low to land at the lodge's grassy private airfield, there were graceful giraffes and a family of elephants enjoying their pasture in the plains, or mara, below.

The lodge's name is inspired by the Swahili word for 'suspended in mid-air', and that's exactly how it feels from the 30 tented suites situated 980ft (300m) above the Great Rift Valley.

Each suite, designed like a stylish open plan apartment, has a mesmerising view overlooking the Maasai Mara, the loveliest game reserve on the continent.

The pivotal picnic scene from Out of Africa was filmed in the grounds of Angama Mara. As a surprise for us, Roar Africa (which organises safaris in 13 African countries) arranged a picnic on the crest of the Out of Africa kopje that is featured on the movie's poster.

BABOONS WITH A TASTE FOR CHAMPAGNE

Angama Mara offers spellbinding views of the Maasai Mara, the 'loveliest game reserve on the continent'

'Each [Angama Mara] suite is designed like a stylish open-plan apartment,' writes Frank

We were guided up the hill to discover an old-world picnic scene - canvas safari chairs, a wicker picnic basket, tasty picnic food, checked blankets, comfy cushions, a bottle of bubbly, coffee in a Stanley flask, and of course, that spectacular view.

A little unsettling was the nearby sound of a wild dog barking, out of sight but circling silently around the picnic area. Maybe we should have got that rabies shot after all.

After finishing the picnic, we kept our eyes peeled as we descended the hill, but our driver laughed as we told him about our fears about being eaten alive by a vicious wild dog.

He told us that it was just a baboon alerting his family about our presence – it turns out that they are regulars as they hang around to eat the picnic leftovers. Hopefully, the baboons didn't drink all the Champagne we left behind.

THE ROCKING CHAIR SAFARI, THE SAFEST IN THE WORLD

Frank embarked on what Angama Mara playfully calls The Rocking Chair Safari - watching the animals from the comfort of rocking chairs on your bedroom terrace with a pair of binoculars

Guests from Angama Mara on a safari, which are conducted at sunrise and sunset in completely open game-viewing vehicles

Later, back at the lodge, I opened a beautiful leather-bound copy of Out of Africa and never have Blixen's words 'you woke up in the morning and thought: Here I am, where I ought to be' felt more appropriate. I picked up the binoculars in the room and sat in the rocking chair on the terrace.

I scanned the golden expanse of the plains with dozens of zebras and impalas grazing silently. I was embarking on what the hotel playfully calls The Rocking Chair Safari. I was impatient to try the real thing, but for now, I would have to make do with a curious furry rotund hyrax, or rock rabbit, peering into our tent, with the cutest little tusks.

Despite being little over a foot in length, I was astonished to discover that the hyrax is the closest living relative to the elephant – this one spends most of the afternoon sun-bathing on a nearby rocky ledge.

Safaris are conducted at sunrise and sunset in completely open game viewing vehicles, with canvas roofs as shelter from the sun. Alice, a local Maasai, was our guide for our game drives. She is highly educated and passionate about wildlife conservation. She was constantly on the walkie talkie to her network of fellow guides (from other resorts in the Mara), directing each other to sightings of the Big Five.

On his safari at Angama Mara, Frank saw a sleepy pride of lions, a buffalo enjoying a mud bath and a lone rhino (stock image)

So within an hour or two, we had seen a pride of sleepy lions and a lone rhino. The following day we saw the same pride of lions stake out a buffalo that had retreated into the relative safety of marshy water.

On our way back to the lodge, we passed a triumvirate of ancient-looking buffalo enjoying a soothing mud bath, and Alice told us that they are known as the resident 'retired generals'.

Alice is a natural story-teller and we learned many surprising facts - who knew that a giraffe's tongue is blue or that they are insomniacs, usually only sleeping for 30 minutes a night, or that an ostrich is the Usain Bolt of the wild, able to run up to 45 miles an hour? Or that a lion sleeps up to 20 hours a day, and that warthogs are one of the few animals that copulate for pleasure? Baby elephants, meanwhile, comfort themselves by sucking their trunks.

While it is well known that the rhino and mountain gorillas are under threat of extinction, giraffes have been quietly suffering what has been called 'the silent extinction', with their numbers dropping by 40 per cent in just 30 years. Hippos are considered to be the most deadly and kill 350 people a year – don't get between them and water!

A LODGE FIT FOR A PRESIDENT OR TWO!

The restaurant at Angama Mara. The local chef at the lodge serves up delicious meals here with the freshest salads picked from the lodge's shamba or vegetable garden, writes Frank

Frank describes the look of Angama Mara, pictured, as being 'architecturally dramatic... an almost dreamlike quality'

Angama Mara's architecturally dramatic guest areas - Maasai brick walls and distinctive cone-shaped buildings -were inspired by colonial-era design in Africa. The beauty of the view has an immediate emotional effect creating an almost dreamlike quality.

The local chef at the lodge serves up delicious meals here with the freshest salads picked from the lodge's shamba or vegetable garden. Kenya's President Kenyatta had only recently departed when we arrived.

But he was not the first President to visit these parts. Barack Obama is half-Kenyan - his father was from a farming family, of the Luo tribe, born on the shores of Lake Victoria in Northern Kenya, his grandfather (a respected Elder) was a medicine man with healing powers.

When he returned with his family in 2006 he was greeted with signs saying 'Obama – welcome home'. They went on safari to the Maasai Mara and a popular tourist stop in the Mara is now the Obama Forest, where he planted a tree.

THE DANCING MAASAI WARRIORS WHOSE WIVES ARE THE HOUSE-BUILDERS

Angama Mara is surrounded by many traditional Maasai homesteads that are built by women

Angama Mara is surrounded by many traditional Maasai homesteads, or manyattas. We drove there and were greeted by villagers dressed in traditional colourful flowing robes performing the jumping dance (the 'adumu') and doing their best to out-jump each other.

We learned that women are still obliged to be the actual house-builders. All the homes we saw were plastered in dried cow dung, the most suitable material, as it is water-proof.

It is a polygamous culture, but in practice the husband can only marry again with the permission of the existing wife, and only if the man is wealthy enough to support more than one wife, wealth being measured in the number of cows owned.

Afterwards, on our way back to the lodge, we were relieved when our 20-something Maasai guide Alice told us that her generation is reluctant to embrace polygamy.

THE TIGER KINGS – FROM THE TOWER OF LONDON IN THE 13TH CENTURY TO NETFLIX

From the 1200s until 1835, the Tower of London was the home of the Royal Menagerie, set up by King Henry III to house a gift of three 'leopards' (most likely lions) from the Holy Roman Emperor

Kenya has impeccable Royal connections. The then Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip spent some time in February 1952 at Treetops Hotel in the Aberdare National Park where they saw elephants, baboons and warthogs and witnessed two rhinos squabbling over a waterhole.

It was at the nearby Sagana Lodge (now used as a Presidential retreat) at the foot of Mount Kenya where the Princess learned the sad news that her father, King George VI, had died and that she was to be Queen.

Of course, the Queen is not the first Royal to encounter exotic animals. From the 1200s until 1835, the Tower of London was the home of the Royal Menagerie, set up by King Henry III to house a gift of three 'leopards' (most likely lions) from the Holy Roman Emperor.

Henry III's Plantagenet crest even featured three lions. Who would have thought that Joe Exotic (aka the Tiger King) was actually following in hallowed Royal footsteps as a keeper of big cats?

Present-day royals have continued their love affair with Africa. Prince William spent some of his gap year in Laikipia in Kenya, and has returned several times, endearing himself to the Kenyan people by announcing that he was learning Swahili.

He even themed his 21st Birthday party bash at Windsor Castle around Out of Africa. In fact, he proposed to Kate Middleton while at a remote lodge at Rutundu in Laikipia County in Kenya in 2010.

Laikipia was our next destination - and Roar Africa arranged for a two-seater Cessna plane to take us on the hour-long journey there. As we drew closer, it was easy to see what attracts the Prince to this part of Kenya. With Mount Kenya as the backdrop, its endless rolling grasslands and thorny acacia trees provide the perfect ecosystem for the Big Five.

THE CACTUS FENCE DETERRING NIGHT PROWLERS

The truly wonderful Segera Retreat, our lodgings for the next three nights, is a stunning self-styled oasis of luxury in 50,000 acres of wild Kenyan savanna.

Six solar-powered thatched villas in a lush, landscaped garden give guests access to unparalleled comfort. The gardens play host to a superb collection of contemporary African sculpture and installations.

As soon as we arrived, we were whisked off to a beautiful setting by a stream for a delightful open-air lunch, in precisely the same spot that President Kenyatta and his wife had enjoyed a few months earlier.

As if on cue, two elephants appeared and go mano a mano, fighting for supremacy. The older and larger one was vanquished and chased for at least half a mile until his humiliation was complete.

Segera Retreat's mission is 'to create an eco-sphere, a sustainable relationship between the local community, the wildlife and its thrill-seeking guests'

A villa bedroom at Segera Retreat, which is owned by wealthy German entrepreneur Jochen Zeitz

Frank describes Segera Retreat as beautiful and luxurious with 'Michelin-star quality meals prepared by local chefs'

Segera Retreat is owned by Jochen Zeitz, a wealthy German entrepreneur, who founded the Zeitz Foundation, which invests in conservation and community projects, including the Tree of Life reforestation project where one million trees (in the shape of a rhino) are being planted.

By removing fences and opening migration corridors, Zeitz has transformed Segera Retreat into a thriving wildlife conservation area, with a profusion of extraordinary birdlife and many endangered and rare species including Patas monkeys and Grevy's zebras.

Instead of a traditional fence in front of our villa to keep out Big Five night prowlers, there was a rather beautiful flowering 12-ft-high cactus tree hedge in front that acted as a deterrent.

Apparently the big cats are not fans of succulents. Well, at least we hoped that wasn't true. That night, against the backdrop of a dazzling starry sky, there were the sounds of an elephant devouring one of the trees on the compound and a lion growling.

It felt like it was at our door-step, but we tried to reassure ourselves that a lion's roar can carry for five miles, so perhaps he was further away than we thought.

ELVIS THE ROCK 'N ROLL SAFARI GUIDE WHO WILL LEAVE YOU ALL SHOOK UP

Frank's safari guide at Segera was the 'intrepid and fearless' Elvis, who is 'the man' if you're looking for a thrill-seeking game drive. Pictured is a herd of elephants roaming the Segera conservation area

Our local safari guide at Segera was the intrepid and fearless Elvis, and he was indeed the ultimate rock 'n' roll tour guide.

If you are looking for a thrill-seeking game drive, Elvis is the man.

He will enjoy driving you through a herd of 100 giant-horned buffalos that might leave you All Shook Up or do a drive-by of a family of hungry hyenas.

Just as you are catching your breath, he will veer down a meandering dirt track where you might see a leopard looking languorously from a crooked wind-bent tree until the tracks end at a spectacular waterfall, where a collection of baboons stare enchanted by the light reflecting in the water and creating a vivid rainbow effect.

It's as primal a scene as you can get on this earth. There is nothing quite like it.

THE BIRD'S NEST THAT ATTRACTS A PRIDE OF LIONS

The Segera Lodge boasts the Bird's Nest - a stylishly designed two-storey treetop escape that offers 360-degrees views of the savanna

The interior of the Bird's Nest, which is 'perched near a river teeming with wildlife a 10-minute drive from the main hotel'

Karen Blixen believed that 'there is something about safari life that makes you forget all your sorrows and feel as if you had drunk half a bottle of Champagne — bubbling over with heartfelt gratitude for being alive'. A glass of bubbly is just what we needed after an exhilarating game drive. Elvis drove us for a sundowner at the beautiful Nay Palad Bird's Nest.

From a distance it looks like a giant Afro on stilts, but the Bird's Nest turns out to be a stylishly designed two-storey treetop escape. It is perched near a river teeming with wildlife about a 10-minute drive from the main hotel. It offers 360-degree views of the savanna by day that are matched only by a breathtaking view of the stars at night.

In the morning, guests awaken to the magical sounds of animals at play below – in fact, a pride of lions has been known to spend the night in the ground floor solar powered shower-room. Never has the lilting Swahili expression seemed so appropriate - 'Lala Salama' or 'Sleep Safely'.

THE TIGER MOTH AND THE PINK FLAMINGOS

Frank says Segera Retreat is a thriving wildlife conservation area, with a profusion of extraordinary birdlife and many endangered and rare species

While not quite a private jet, Jochen Zeitz bought the actual mustard-coloured De Havilland Tiger Moth plane that featured in the aerial sequences in Out of Africa. It is now beautifully restored and sits proudly in a hangar on the estate.

Our return charter flight to Nairobi (on a Cessna, not the 90-year-old Tiger Moth, sadly) took us low over the Aberdare Mountain Range, past the Queen's beloved Sagana Lodge and a beautiful freshwater lake, but we did not rouse any pink flamingos like in the beautiful scene from Out of Africa - they prefer the languor of saltwater.

The notoriously hard-to-please Robert Redford said 'I've never travelled like this before' and I can see why, having sampled the delights of Angama and Segera. Roar Africa's carefully curated itinerary captured the glamour of Africa and showcased just why Karen Blixen viewed it as her paradise.

The history of Kenya is full of larger-than-life characters – from Hemingway himself to Lt Colonel Patterson, author of The Man Eaters of Tsavo (played on screen by Val Kilmer), and Sir Henry Delves Broughton, who was prosecuted for the murder of his love rival, as portrayed in White Mischief. More recently, Joe Exotic, aka Tiger King, also stands behind bars, convicted of the attempted murder of a 'Big Cat' rival.

Tiger King was once described as 'like a mythical character living out in the middle of bumf*** Oklahoma who owned 1,200 tigers and lions and bears and s***.'

Forget about visiting the Tiger King's G.W. Zoo or Carole Baskin's Big Cat Rescue. Kenya offers the real deal. And here all your worries will feel like a distant memory. Or as they like to say in Swahili - Hakuna Matata. No worries indeed.

Wildly luxurious! The £102,000 safari billed 'the world's greatest' where guests fly to plush African lodges in an Emirates A319 PRIVATE JET, which has 10 bedroom suites and a shower spa

By Ted Thornhill, MailOnline Travel Editor

It's being billed as 'the greatest safari in the world' – though some might conclude that it's the greatest holiday in the world. Full stop.

Unsurprisingly, it's not cheap. You'll need to find $125,000 (£102,000) to book a place on the 'Roar Africa Emirates Executive Private Jet Safari', but for that whopping sum, you'll go 'beyond first class', flown on a bespoke Emirates A319 – complete with 10 private suites and a 'shower spa' – to four jaw-dropping African camps and lodges.

And the 12-day itinerary includes Africa's 'Holy Grail' experiences - taking in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls (one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World), the Okavango Delta in Botswana (the largest inland delta in the world), Kenya's Great Migration, and the world's last wild mountain gorillas in the forests of Rwanda.

'The greatest safari in the world' will see guests flown around Africa on an Emirates A319 private jet (pictured)

The Emirates A319 (pictured) will be the sole means of international transport throughout the entire journey

The jet, said Emirates, was 'created for guests who want to go beyond first class and reflects the glamour of a bygone era, when air travel was both exclusive and an integral aspect of luxury travel experiences'

The trip, which takes place in August 2021 and is being offered to just 10 people, begins with a night at the five-star Burj Al Arab Jumeirah hotel in Dubai.

The Emirates A319 the guests board the next day for Africa will be the sole means of international transport throughout the entire journey.

They will feel like royalty – if they aren't already.

The Emirates private A319 has a 'powder room, an expansive lounge which functions as a communal gathering space or restaurant, and a cabin crew committed to providing the highest levels of personal service'. And five-star bathrooms

The Emirates A319 has 10 private suites, pictured. On the safari flight the guests will enjoy screenings of documentaries about Africa from notables such as historian David Attenborough

The 12-day itinerary includes Africa's 'Holy Grail' experiences - taking in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls (one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World), the Okavango Delta in Botswana (the largest inland delta in the world), Kenya's Great Migration, and the world's last wild mountain gorillas in the forests of Rwanda. Pictured are the suites on the Emirates A319

The jet, said Emirates, was 'created for guests who want to go beyond first class and reflects the glamour of a bygone era, when air travel was both exclusive and an integral aspect of luxury travel experiences'.

As well as private suites and a private shower spa, there's also a 'powder room, an expansive lounge which functions as a communal gathering space or restaurant, and a cabin crew committed to providing the highest levels of personal service'.

Guests will also enjoy screenings of documentaries about Africa from notables such as historian David Attenborough, conservationists Dereck and Beverly Joubert, and environmentalist and filmmaker Craig Foster.

All the destinations for the trip – which is being run jointly with ultra-luxe travel firm Roar Africa - have been hand-picked 'because of their shared vision and commitment to creating a better future, combined with the charm and hospitality of their local communities and residents'.

They're also extremely luxurious.

The first destination, on August 18, 2021, is Mpala Jena Camp, located in the Zambezi National Park in Zimbabwe, a few miles upstream from Victoria Falls.

The first destination, on August 18, 2021, is Mpala Jena Camp (pictured), located in the Zambezi National Park in Zimbabwe

All the rooms at Mpala Jena Camp, pictured, boast private plunge pools with views of the Zambezi River

Its website says: 'The camp's guest tents are under flowing canvas, with open (yet netted) views of the river and Moroccan influences throughout the décor, a reference to the early Arab explorer's adventures up the Zambezi in search of gold in the 16th century. Decking in front of the tent leads to a private plunge pool with views of the flowing waters of the Zambezi River.'

The second lodge, which the guests will arrive at on August 20, is Duba Plains Okavango Delta in Botswana, which 'evokes the classic African safari style of the 1920's' with 'rooms raised on recycled railway sleeper decking and with stunning views of the surrounding floodplain'.

On August 23 the guests will arrive at the incredible Mara Plains Camp in the Kenyan Maasai Mara. MailOnline Travel can vouch for this one. The author of this story stayed there in 2016, describing it as 'a camp that specialises in making its guests feel like they're kings and queens of the savannah', that 'takes glamping into uncharted territory with luxuriousness and service I didn't know could exist in tents'.

THE WORLD'S GREATEST SAFARI ITINERARY August 17, 2021 - Burj Al Arab Jumeirah, Dubai, UAE August 18, 19 - Mpala Jena Camp, Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe August 20, 21, 22 - Duba Plains Okavango Delta August 23, 24, 25 - Mara Plains Camp, Maasai Mara, Kenya August 26, 27, 28 - Singita Kwitonda, Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda Advertisement

The fourth stopover, on August 26, is at Singita Kwitonda in Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park.

It has an 'unparalleled position [that] puts life-changing gorilla-trekking experiences within easy reach', along with eight luxurious suites with private heated plunge pools.

Plus 'large timber-framed windows that welcome the breathtaking scenery and volcano views inside'.

Deborah Calmeyer, founder and CEO of Roar Africa

The expert chaperones accompanying the group, meanwhile, include Deborah Calmeyer, founder and CEO of Roar Africa, Humphrey Gumbo, Roar Africa's specialist safari guide with nearly 20 years of professional guiding experience in multiple African countries - and Dr. Ian McCallum, 'renowned poet, conservationist and psychiatrist who is one of the most eloquent ambassadors for wilderness and wild animals'.

Guests will also 'enjoy interacting with other seasoned professionals in their respective fields with extensive knowledge of their African homeland'.

Included among the 'notable participants who will impart fascinating facts and keen insights into the regions visited' is Zoologist Dr. Lucy King, who will 'speak to her personal conservation journey with elephants, bees, and villages'.

Ms Calmeyer explained that the bucket list experience is designed to deepen knowledge of the natural world.

She said: 'It has never been more important than now to curate experiences that facilitate an understanding of how the natural world works. We have curated this strategic itinerary by working from a place of deep insight and acute understanding of Africa's many strengths and complexities. We have painstakingly selected profound destinations and intimate wildlife discoveries to reveal what must be done to ensure that Africa's people, nature and animals survive and thrive.

'And knowing that time is a non-renewable resource, guests will appreciate the absolute exclusivity and unparalleled ease of travel.

'This authentic experience not only sets a new paradigm in ultra-luxe adventure and sustainable travel, but is a robust catalyst for change by facilitating active participation and insightful dialogue between informed, conscious travellers and local communities.

Sonoco Reels & Plugs has marked another milestone in its quest to enhance manufacturing workforce development by employing and training students eager to launch rewarding careers.

The company recently celebrated seven high school seniors who excelled in the Tiger Launch program as they “signed on” for full-time positions at Sonoco.

The 2020 Tiger Launch Graduation Signing Ceremony was held May 12 at Sonoco’s Tiger Launch facility in Hartselle.

Tiger Launch is an apprenticeship-style program begun fall 2018 in partnership with Hartselle City Schools. The eight-student program grew to 24 students in fall 2019 and is expected to welcome about 40 for the coming school year.

The 2020 graduates who have accepted post-graduation positions at Sonoco are Briten Barclay, Wesley Long, Weston Philpot, Caleb Puckett, Thomas Prus, Levi Rice and Daniel Sandlin. The signing ceremony made their continued employment at Sonoco official as they take on new, full-time roles and begin mentoring others.

Sonoco leaders, including plant managers Matt Williams and Todd Whatley, superintendent Doug Ainsworth and Tiger Launch manager Richard Long, gathered with the seven graduates for the ceremony. They were joined by HCS Superintendent Dr. Dee Dee Jones, who serves as Tiger Launch program manager, as well as Jeff Hyche, a career tech instructional planner and former principal of Hartselle High.

Ten other seniors who participated in the program this year are taking what they learned at Sonoco with them to college and other opportunities.

During half days at school and half days at Sonoco, the largest industrial employer in Hartselle, Tiger Launch students completed coursework while getting hands-on manufacturing experience in producing reels, spools and other industrial products.

The program was modeled after “12 for Life,” an initiative started by Southwire, one of Sonoco Reels & Plugs’ biggest customers, more than a decade ago in Florence.

“Through Tiger Launch, students get a chance to learn the discipline it takes to really be successful in the workplace. At the same time, we gain an opportunity to understand our incoming workforce and how we can apply our learning to facility processes and improvements,” Williams said.

“When the program started, the unemployment rate in our area was very low,” Long added. “Tiger Launch allowed us to pick out ‘the cream of the crop’ and give kids a great opportunity to make a contribution to Sonoco and the community we work in. Originally, all the students came from Hartselle High School. Now Morgan County has joined us with kids from both Danville and Brewer high schools. For the upcoming school year, we also plan to welcome Falkville and Priceville High School students.”

Long said the growth and success of Tiger Launch has depended greatly on Sonoco management’s dedication to the program.

“Without their willingness to be all in, it never would have worked,” Long said. “You have to believe that if you do the right thing for students and the community, the break–even point and financial benefits will come.

“Giving students resume experience and the opportunity to learn work skills is great for them and for the company, whether they stay with Sonoco or not.”

One student, Courtney Shaddrix, was considering becoming a pediatric nurse, but she jumped at the chance to get the workplace experience Tiger Launch offered.

“I found I really liked building fiber drum reels, doing reel hardware kitting, working with my hands and learning about the business aspects of a company from the inside out,” she said. “Not only did I get to know what a real-world working experience is like, I was also able to build relationships with people who will be friends and supporters for life.”

Now, a year after she graduated from the program, Shaddrix is line lead and a guiding force in Sonoco’s Tiger Launch facility. “This has been a really eye-opening experience for me and a lot of other students,” Shaddrix said, “and we really appreciate everything it has done for us.”

“I felt so bad for graduating seniors this year with everything that has happened. We were more excited than ever to be able to reward them for the opportunity they have created for themselves through hard work at Sonoco,” Long said. “Going forward, we can’t wait to develop more workplace relationships with the younger people we need to continue our company’s lasting legacy of success in north Alabama.”

attention as the international community assesses the cost of human lives lost, the outlay for healthcare, economic losses, social upheaval and political instability that has occurred and will continue in the foreseeable future.

The fate of wildlife worldwide is no better as they suffer from habitat loss, poaching, disease, natural disasters, floods, fire, and drought. The 21st century saw the extinction of various species and this is the century that will decide whether Man can co-exist with wildlife on a win-win formula. 20 years of this century have gone by and there is not much improvement for wildlife globally. The remaining decades will prove whether Planet Earth will be called home by both Man and wildlife, or by Man alone. Covid-19 has given a new impetus to balance development and nature for holistic progress.

For mankind, a vaccine is being rushed through but wildlife are left to fend for themselves to counter the onslaught of Man against their natural habitat. Zoonotic diseases helped to protect wildlife but they are losing their sting as vaccines overcome them enabling people to continue preying on endangered wildlife. Zoonotic diseases are not the only problem as some diseases transmitted among humans are equally as deadly as was the case when European explorers to the New World (the Americas) passed on diseases that wiped out large populations of natives who had no immunity. The Covid-19 lockdown has given a flashback of the world decades ago. One could see pictures of leopards, elephants, civet cats, deer, and even lions entering villages and residential areas in many part parts of the world taking advantage of the lull in human activities during the lockdown, and possibly wanting to reclaim their lost habitat!

Global warming and climate change are adding to the woes of wildlife, which unlike Man, cannot easily adapt to changing conditions. The recent great Australian fire caused great destruction to wildlife and reportedly more than a billion creatures- big, small, and tiny – perished in the flames. The Earth’s temperature is going up by 1-2 degrees but many are denying it, and wildlife from polar bears to penguins are threatened. Doesn’t the smoke and heat resulting from a wide range of socio-economic activities cause a dent in the ozone layer? Can anyone think of an activity that cools the earth? The answer is an emphatic ‘none!’ Having endangered wildlife, how long can Man prevent the danger to himself? Nowadays, environmental degradation, pollution, and natural disasters are taking a heavy toll on nations, and billions of dollars have to be spent on repairs and rehabilitation, and some nations and politicians continue to be in denial mode about climate change despite nations being buffeted by a series of natural calamities.

Covid-19 could threaten wildlife even more than before as travel and tourism are devastated. Many wildlife sanctuaries have been funded and protected with tourism revenue and communities around the parks and reserves are sustained by this arrangement. When tourism declines, poaching and trafficking may increase, jeopardizing wildlife. Tourism has been affected much and the tourist dollar that supports conservation and wildlife habitats will dry up and open prospects for poaching and trafficking to overcome poverty and unemployment. Even with tourist revenues, there was the ever-present risk of poaching of endangered wildlife. According to Charles Darwin the success of any species depended on natural selection but presently it depends on human selection – which animals can be saved by conservationists and which will face extinction at the hands of poachers.

The time has come for Man to actively help wildlife escape extinction. India and China, despite their huge populations, are finding success in supporting and conservation of wildlife. In India the tiger, Gir Lions, Rhino, Gaur, elephants, and leopards continue to thrive and China too has found success with the rehabilitation of the Siberian tiger, various pandas, the Tibetan antelope, and many other animals. There are also successful rehabilitation efforts in the Americas, Europe, Russia, and Australia. A major concern is with sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia which are volatile and risky for a wide range of wildlife brought by poaching, trafficking of wild animal parts, and agriculture. The Amazon, the Congo, Borneo, and New Guinea regions are at risk of agriculture and timber exploitation as these areas are not only huge but are well known for their bio-diversity.

It has now come to a stage where wildlife needs the active assistance of Man to prevent extinction, and various methods are implemented – research, culling, re-location, tagging of wild animals, patrolling of parks to prevent poaching, educating people near wildlife sanctuaries on the need to protect wildlife and eco-tourism benefits. In this regard, trophy hunting of large wildlife like lions, elephants, antelopes, deer, and buffaloes should be stopped in the Southern African countries. The largest and strongest of these animals symbolize the best of the species genetically and should be preserved, not killed for trophy hunting mainly by Western big game hunters. The episode of Cecil, the Kenyan lion, killed by a trophy hunter created much criticism and controversy, and this opportunity should have been used to ban trophy hunting outright, especially of endangered animals. Many of these species, male and female, need to be genetically strong to breed offspring that can survive in the wild in a fast-changing physical habitat. Many countries allow this practice as the hunters pay a high price for permits. These hunters could be persuaded to use tranquilisers instead of bullets to bring down their targets and after having satisfied their egos with a few photos of the downed animal, they can give an antidote to revive the animal. This is very much better than killing the animal.

Eco-tourists can also play a part as a pressure group forcing governments to act on wildlife conservation as they bring in tourism revenue to some cash-strapped African countries. They should oppose trophy hunting, poaching, and trafficking of endangered animal parts such as tusks and horns, skin, and game meat. They can also lend their voice when they see a need for pro-active government action. As an example, thousands of wildebeest, deer, antelopes, and zebras die when crossing the Mara River in Kenya during the annual migration mainly because of the extremely steep slopes of the river, much more than are killed by the river or land predators. Flooding has resulted in the steep slopes. It is a sad spectacle to see a huge number of animals falling one on top of the other and getting injured or dying in the process. This grim scenario is watched by tourists wanting to observe the migration who also park their vehicles near the banks of the river to get a closer view. One wonders why the government, which earns so much from eco-tourism, cannot flatten the steep slopes using excavators or create safer crossings along the river, and also prevent tourists from blocking the path of the migrating herds near the river. The migration now of thousands of wildebeest and others could end up as a trickle in the decades ahead if nothing is done to mitigate the losses. As I mentioned earlier wildlife needs active human intervention to ward off possible extinction.

The trans-location of endangered wildlife must be seriously considered. There were plans to relocate the Gir lions in Gujerat, India to Madya Pradesh in case of any war or other calamity but it has been put on hold for decades now. So is the plan to re-introduce the extinct Indian cheetah back in its natural habitat. Both the Indian cheetah and tiger were decimated by Indian royalty and the British before Indian independence. India has a successful conservation program for tigers, which have made a dramatic recovery in their numbers in recent decades. Wildlife in the deserts of the Middle East especially deer and antelopes have also recovered after a brush with extinction due to government efforts and so has the Siberian tiger recovered in numbers in the icy wilderness of Siberia due to the efforts of China and Russia. In the future, the translocation of endangered animals to large countries that offer better protection may become the final option.

Man forcibly has to play God to ensure the continued existence of wildlife especially those facing extinction. Nursing mother tigers especially in South East Asia need to be helped by providing meat or dead prey animals close to their lairs as a mother tiger's long absence endangers her cubs. This will help reduce the mortality rate of cubs and ensure that the tiger population increases. This method can be done to other extinction-facing animals especially the big cats. Similarly, if the number of lions or cheetahs goes down drastically in sub-Saharan Africa, this could be due to a shortage of prey or disease. However, if this is due to fierce competition from hyenas, then the culling of hyenas needs to be done to ensure the survival of lions and cheetahs, which are more endangered than hyenas. Wildlife experts and researchers can recommend the steps to be taken by the government. Even the forest dwellers, natives, and aborigines should not be allowed to hunt endangered wildlife. Hunting of prey animals by issuing permits and licenses needs to be strictly controlled even if the prey is abundant. Sale of game meat must be banned, and it is appreciable that China has taken strict measures to prevent a repeat of the Covid-19 pandemic. Abundant prey like deer, wild boar, antelope, and buffalo means easier kills for the big cats and less trespassing into villages or agricultural areas in search of food. Seeds of fruit and nut-bearing trees can be scattered in the forests by game rangers and the seeds may grow into trees and provide food for a wide array of animals to somewhat compensate for the loss of their habitat. Governments need to have a proactive program of compensating villagers and farmers who lose their crops or livestock to wild animals to prevent revenge-killing or poisoning. The battle for conservation is equally crucial at sea as it is on land and issues such as the finning of sharks, killing of whales, and over-fishing also need to be addressed.

Another controversial practice is the burning of confiscated loot such as rhino horns, elephant tusks and other items on a regular basis by various government authorities. Tens of millions of dollars worth of precious cargo goes up in flames giving those around a sense of false satisfaction. This practice needs to be criticized as these valuable items are unlike counterfeit contraband such as fake CDs or watches. The precious ivory can be stored for future use perhaps even to provide funds for wildlife conservation.

One has to criticize the WWF for not doing enough for wildlife globally. It is time the UN sets up a specialized agency for the protection of wildlife similar to the WHO or UNESCO. Simply positioning some VIPs to head the WWF is not enough. Wildlife conservation and protection are serious matters and only leaders who can voice out and criticize governments are needed to address the various issues. The Nobel Prize Committee could give more focus to conservationists, researchers, and NGOs protecting wildlife. It is time wildlife protection is separated from environmental issues because although they are linked, more focus needs to be given to the former. Pressure must be brought on governments that close an eye to corrupt practices allowing timber smuggling thereby encouraging deforestation or the smuggling of wildlife parts. Punishments to poachers, smugglers and others aiding or abetting should be severe. During the present lockdowns in many countries, the problems facing zoos were highlighted, especially poor revenue collection affecting the welfare of the animals. Governments need to have strict control of zoos to prevent abuse of the animals. It is also time that, legally, wild animals are given special rights – very much like human rights - to correct the injustice done to wildlife. It will be really good if wildlife protection had big-hearted leaders, like billionaire Bill Gates whose foundation helps with socio-economic programs, who could provide leadership and financial assistance . Helping wildlife conservation is truly rewarding and satisfying. Wildlife have no one to turn to except Man and governments to protect them. More young volunteers are needed for wildlife conservation. Planet Earth is also the home for wildlife, and education should encompass knowledge of conservation and the environment through exam topics for essays and comprehension for students as the young are the leaders of the future. In conclusion one can say that the Covid-19 pandemic has made it more difficult to give priority to the welfare of wildlife. Now, most governments will be focused on issues such as unemployment, socio-economic stimulus, and political stability and this could prevail for the whole decade. The Covid-19 pandemic could be a turning point - for the better or worse for wildlife.

As soon as the doors to their cages opened, the pups skipped over the rocky shoreline of Rancho Palos Verdes straight to the water’s edge — then frolicked about in the surf for a moment before swimming out past the breakers, according to a video the resort posted on YouTube this week.

“What an exciting release,” Amber Becerra, president of Marine Mammal Care Center, said in the video. “They just bounced right out there into the ocean. They knew exactly where to go and what to do. They even gave each other a kiss on the way out.”

The young ones were separated from their mothers and emaciated when they were found earlier this year, one by the Marine Animal Rescue at the Redondo Beach Harbor Patrol Dock and another by the California Wildlife Center on a resident’s porch.

The Marine Mammal Care Center, which specializes in caring for sea lions, took the pups in and nursed them back to good health at the center’s rehab facility at Fort MacArthur in San Pedro.

The pups left the care center weighing twice as much as when they arrived

“We are delighted to share this positive recovery as part of our ongoing mission to care for and protect Los Angeles marine life,” Becerra said.

The care center was founded in 1992 on the former site of Marineland of the Pacific, which closed in 1987; Terranea Resort is on the site now, and has partnered with the care center for more than 10 years.

“We are committed to protecting and stewarding this unparalleled coastal setting,” said Terranea Resort President Terri A. Haack, “and supporting the education of our visitors and guests to enhance awareness and encourage additional support for our partners in the community.”

UPDATE 3PM: Superintendent Greg Moore said the injured keeper, Jennifer Brown, was an experienced staff member. He said police would work with the zoo to improve safety protocols. ""Understandably it's had a big impact on the staff - it's a small zoo and the staff are tight-knit,"" he said. ""And full credit to them for following their training to assist their colleague."" Supt Moore said he couldn't say whether the lions involved would be put down. UPDATE 12.32PM: Inspector Faye Stockman, Duty Operations Manager, NSW Ambulance has addressed the media. ""This is one of the worst jobs I have ever experienced - I have never come across a job like this in my career,"" she said. ""It was absolutely harrowing. It is an incredibly dangerous situations, both for the patient and the paramedics."" ""Being the first to walk into the enclosure was one of the most frightening experiences - we literally had to walk into a lion's den ""The attack was extremely vicious and paramedics found the woman with severe injuries. ""We are trained to deal with extreme or unusual situations, however, we do have support services available to us."" UPDATE 12.26PM: NSW Police Media have issues a statement about the incident. ""A woman has been airlifted to hospital after being attacked by two lions at a zoo on the South Coast today,"" it said. ""A 35-year-old woman was treated at the scene by NSW Ambulance paramedics for head and neck injuries, before being airlifted to St George Hospital in a critical but stable condition. ""Police have been told the woman was cleaning the enclosure at the time. ""Officers from South Coast Police District established a crime scene and commenced inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the incident."" UPDATE 12.08pm: NSW Ambulance have confirmed the woman has been taken by helicopter to St George Hospital. She is in a critical condition. It is understood she was in an enclosure with two two-year-old lions at the time of the attack. UPDATE 11.42AM: Ambulance media have confirmed the injuries were the result of a lion attack. The woman is in a critical condition. Multiple ambulance crews are on scene. It is understood the woman is being treated on scene and the ambulance helicopter has not left yet. A helicopter is on its way to Nowra after a keeper at Shoalhaven Zoo was reported to be unconscious with neck and facial injuries. A NSW Ambulance spokesperson confirmed they were called just before 10.20am on Friday, May 29. ""There are reports of an unconscious zookeeper in the lion enclosure,"" the spokesperson said. ""The 35-year-old woman sounds like she has neck and facial injuries."" Several ambulance crews are already on the scene. More information to come. The zoo has been part of the Shoalhaven for almost 50 years. Originally a wildlife park, in 2011 it changed it's name to the Shoalhaven Zoo to reflect the increased number of exotic animals on display, alongside native wildlife. In 2014 a crocodile handler was rushed to Shoalhaven Hospital from the zoo, after a crocodile grabbed him by the hand and dragged him into the water during a feeding demonstration. The handler recovered in a Sydney hospital.

LANDSCAPE NEWS

Don’t forget to register for next week’s GLF Bonn Digital Conference on the future of food (3–5 June). Discover what’s on the agenda, who you’ll hear from, and how to get the most out of it.

At Landscape News, we’re bringing you 10 sessions exploring the role of storytelling in tackling climate change and reconnecting with nature. Join us in conversation with environmental journalists Bill McKibben and Viktorija Mickute, media theorist Douglas Rushkoff, and many more.

While you’re waiting, here’s an explainer on why biodiversity matters, an ode to the red panda, and the latest on forests. Plus, how COVID-19 could impact the great apes and food security in Africa.

COVID-19

Could antibodies from llamas help fight COVID-19? Scientists are hopeful. Some also say that we shouldn’t blame bats for this pandemic.

Global carbon emissions have declined by 17 percent compared to 2019, though they’re expected to rebound as countries emerge from lockdown. Wildlife, too, is rebounding in the U.S.’s shuttered national parks.

The GLF isn’t alone in its forays into the digital ecosystem: from Microsoft to the American Physical Society, virtual conferences are on the rise. Benefits include accessibility for participants who couldn’t otherwise afford to attend and preventing millions of kilometers of unnecessary air travel.

CLIMATE

Cyclone Amphan struck eastern India and Bangladesh last week, becoming the strongest cyclone to hit the Ganges Delta in over a decade, and the costliest ever. Scientists are increasingly convinced that climate change has made tropical cyclones more intense over the last 40 years.

Trees are a crucial climate solution – but in the Arctic, they could worsen the issue as carbon dioxide levels rise. In the tropics, meanwhile, most forests may no longer be effective at sequestering carbon if global warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius.

Both natural gas and renewable energy are taking a hit from COVID-19 as energy demand dries up. Despite that, a major new oil pipeline is set to be built across East Africa.

PEOPLE

Over 350 organizations representing health workers from across the globe have called on the G20 leaders to ensure a green recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Likewise, climate activists Fridays for Future are pressuring the E.U. to reform the agricultural sector to drastically reduce its carbon footprint. Extinction Rebellion lined London’s Trafalgar Square with children’s shoes in protest against British state aid for carbon-intensive industries.

In the Philippines, environmental activists have been targeted during lockdown, while globally, the murders and disappearances of numerous fishery observers remain shrouded in mystery.

And Michael Moore’s controversial new documentary, which we covered last time, has been removed from YouTube over copyright issues.

PLANET

While the world’s attention has been fixated on COVID-19, this year’s other major outbreak – of locusts – is threatening food security in East Africa, the Middle East, and increasingly South Asia. The U.S. is helping track the locusts using a digital tool originally developed to monitor wildfires and volcanic activity.

China is preparing legislation to ban the wildlife trade, but traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is likely to be exempted. TCM practitioners warn that the field’s reputation is being tarnished by a small minority who continue to use endangered animal parts.

Microplastic pollution in the oceans might be much more widespread than previously thought – and it’s also being passed up the food chain via rivers.

POLICY

The E.U. has pledged EUR 20 billion a year to protect biodiversity and restore landscapes as part of the European Green Deal. The new plan aims to protect 30 percent of Europe’s land and oceans by 2030. Conservation groups are cautiously optimistic, noting that previous E.U. biodiversity plans were poorly enforced.

Meanwhile, Brazil’s Environment Minister is seeking to weaken environmental regulations while the public is distracted by COVID-19, even though the country’s carbon emissions are set to rise this year, unlike most of the world.

Another country that could have trouble meeting its climate targets is China, which is betting on coal, steel and other carbon-intensive industries to stimulate its economy.

BUSINESS

Plant-based drinks bottles could soon be coming to a store near you. Dutch biochemicals firm Avantium is working with Coca-Cola, Danone and Carlsberg to develop plastic from plant sugars rather than oil.

Canada is offering COVID-19 relief to businesses, but only if they disclose their climate impacts and commit to supporting national climate goals.

Lastly, Nordic investors are increasingly turning their backs on fossil fuels and other highly polluting industries – as is Google, which will no longer build artificial intelligence tools for oil and gas extraction."~[]

Eight pandas moved to their new home in the ancient town of Fenghuang in central China's Hunan Province on Friday.

This is the first time the ancient town, also a popular tourist destination, has welcomed giant pandas. The animals will make Fenghuang their permanent home.

With the average annual temperature ranging from 12.6 to 16.7 degrees Celsius, Fenghuang County boasts more than 3,333 hectares of bamboo forest, providing a good habitat for giant pandas.

To provide a good living environment for the new arrivals, Fenghuang has built a panda theme park.

Two of the eight pandas, named Long Sheng and Qing Feng, were born in 2000 and 2007 respectively. The other six pandas were born in 2017. They were transported from southwest China's Sichuan Province to Fenghuang by a special vehicle.

Before the transportation, the eight pandas were placed under observation in the giant panda protection center, and they are now in good health.

Teng Qiong, director of Fenghuang County Forestry Bureau, said that the pandas were transported in refrigerator trucks for their safety and comfort. A total of six trucks were rented, with four vehicles carrying two giant pandas each, while one truck carried enough bamboo and bamboo shoots for five days, and another empty truck was kept on standby.

""During the transportation, we rested at the high-speed service areas for 30 minutes every three hours. The keepers provided food and water for the pandas and carefully observed their health condition,"" Teng said.

Construction of the panda theme park in Fenghuang started at the end of 2018. It includes a panda house, a panda hospital, a feed processing room, a tourist service center, a science museum and other supporting projects. There will be 16 professional keepers to take care of the pandas in the park."~[]

selfsustaining resource allowing conservation genomics continue around worldplease note commercial profilecontributor profile~"Professors Darren Griffin and Mike Bruford (Universities of Kent and Cardiff) discuss what is meant by a “whole genome sequence” and how it is revolutionising conservation efforts

The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity’s Targets (2010) required signatory countries, by 2020, to minimise genetic erosion and safeguard genetic diversity. Generating genome sequences of farmed/domesticated animals, their wild relatives, cultivated plants and socio-economically/culturally valuable species is needed to progress this goal. The purpose is to revolutionise our understanding of biology and evolution, safeguard biodiversity and create new societal benefits.

A notable example is the sequencing of the SARS-COV2 genome rapidly led to the ability to test and contact trace. While whole-genome sequencing of a microorganism is straightforward, doing so for more complex (e.g. animal or plant) species is still a relatively new concept. In 2001 the first mammals (human and mouse) appeared, the first bird (chicken) in 2004, and the first endangered species (giant panda) in 2010. Since then, the genomes of innumerable microorganisms, animals, plants and fungi have been sequenced, at least to some degree.

Global loss of biodiversity is alarming and increasing. Efforts that result from genome sequencing are, however, showing real promise slowing this trend. Genomic information can revolutionise traditional conservation efforts and provide novel insights with real-world applications. Generation of quality genomic data and its subsequent analysis, interpretation and application, is however challenging and there is a gap between basic research and practical solutions for conservation managers.

Indeed, robust systems must put in place before genome sequence information can be useful, such as:

A quality, and properly annotated reference genome.

Resequencing of key individuals, and proper analysis of enough of them.

Identification of genes relevant to reproductive fitness and viability.

Functional assays to test the phenotypic consequences of genetic variants.

Comparative data from other species, especially when experimenting on endangered species is ethically unacceptable.

Analytical pipelines to achieve all of the above.

Genomic studies have discovered that ‘species are not an island’ as we previously supposed. Indeed, genetic exchange among species appears to be the rule, not the exception, and may help species adapt (e.g. as shown in recent studies of neotropical butterflies Heliconius). Species identification has genuine implications, where populations, protected by their “species label” can benefit from extensive conservation measures or, conversely, be ignored if they don’t have the right one. Moreover, analysis of multiple genomes across numerous groups highlighted the importance of prioritising conservation of organismal groups with an inherent genetic ability to adapt to their surroundings.

A summary of how good quality genome sequences expedite conservation with real practical solutions is given in the table. On the ‘rubbish in, rubbish out’ principle however, poorer quality information is less useful.

What makes a good genome sequence? “Chromosome-level assemblies”

Modern DNA sequencing technology makes it now not too hard nor expensive to create a poor-quality genome. Assigning large blocks of sequence to an overall genomic “map” of an organism can however be problematic and/or expensive. Sadly, most sequenced genomes do not have a good “map” with all genes ordered and assigned in their proper place on chromosomes. Chromosomes are lengths of DNA (analogous to continents and islands) and in every cell of the bodies of all organisms, they are organised in exactly the same way. Every species has its own unique pattern of organization, like the coloured blocks of a national flag.

For instance, three blocks (red, white, and blue) could depict the flag of the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Russia or the former Yugoslavia, depending on the organization. Without this, genome assemblies are little more than a “bag of DNA.” Our work, coupled with contemporary sequencing technologies, uses approaches to take the existing data and visualise directly blocks of sequence as they appear in their rightful place (see figure). We call a full description of this and organised genome a “chromosome level assembly.”

In agriculture, chromosome level assemblies can establish the relationship between the genome and the phenotypes of the plant or animal. They are used extensively in selection and breeding, leading to significant economic impact, more efficient food production and improved global food security. For conservation, with so many species on the CITES threatened/endangered list, such assemblies are essential. For example, some species (like Gyr and Saker falcons) inter-breed readily; hybrids and can be stronger and faster. Others like Peregrines do not form fertile hybrids, however. This is because of differing genome organization among species, something can readily be established with a chromosome level assembly.

At CryoArks we are dedicated to providing a sustainable genomic resource involving collection, curation and DNA extraction from numerous species worldwide. CryoArks aims to break down barriers to conservation management projects caused by permit problems by acquiring a large number of previously collected specimens, and sampling as many new species/populations as possible. Bringing these collections together, both physically and on databases, provides a resource that will be responsibly managed. We will ultimately achieve a step-change in the curation and availability of DNA, tissue and cell line samples, providing a forum for scientists and conservationists, with a self-sustaining resource, allowing conservation genomics to continue around the world.

By October 2017, 42 giant panda cubs had been born at the China Conservation and Research Center, located in Ya’an, China, in the Sichuan province. The staff members at the breeding program decided to make a public debut for 36 of the baby pandas and I’m not sure if anyone can truly handle the cuteness overload.

Out of the 42 newborn pandas at the breeding center, there are 15 pairs of twins. This video from the CCTV Video News Agency features the first public appearance of 36 of the panda cubs, and it’s probably one of the most wholesome videos on Youtube.

Baby pandas typically aren’t in control of their motor skills until about 3-months-old. These panda cubs range in age between 1 to 5-months old, which goes to show why some of them are just miniature giant pandas walking around and why others are even tinier panda babies who can only roll around with their fluffy bodies.

The China Conservation and Research Center not only housed these panda babies, but also the oldest giant panda mother to give birth in 2017. Haizi, a 23-year-old giant panda, had given birth to one of the many pairs of twins that were part of the breeding centers’ public debut.

Li Desheng, one of the breeding program’s giant panda experts said in a statement, “Generally, the maximum breeding age for giant pandas is 20 years old, and pandas older than that are not encouraged to participate in breeding. But Haizi’s success demonstrates the advanced degree of care offered at our center — it is a breakthrough in panda breeding.”

Aside from the obvious but also important humane reasons of why we should care about preserving the panda population, it wouldn’t hurt to add preserving the cuteness to the list.

In the mind-boggling snap shared by Indian Forest Official Ramesh Bishnoi, one can see a deer looking at something. But on taking a closer look, one can spot the predator on the top left corner of the photo.

Twiterratis too have been awestruck by the photo. Captioning the much-liked photo, Ramesh wrote, “Eye contact with predator and prey. Can you spot the predator?”

While such incidents would be quite common in forests every day, but a photograph of such kind is rare.

Sharing his opinion about the incident, a twitter user said, “Why do I have a feeling the predator hides where we least expect it?”

The 21-second clip shows a thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) pacing in an enclosure at the long-closed Beaumaris Zoo in Tasmania, while a narrator talks about the creature's rarity and quirks including its ""striped, unjointed tail.""

""Though, like the [Tasmanian] devil, [the thylacine] is now very rare, being forced out of its natural habitat by the march of civilization,"" the narrator says in the 1935 clip. ""This is the only one in captivity in the world.""

There are fewer than a dozen other short films, amounting to just over 3 minutes of footage, that showcase the thylacine before its extinction. But these black-and-white snippets — taken at Beaumaris Zoo and London Zoo — are silent; the newfound one is the only known footage to have sound, according to a statement from the National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) of Australia.

This is the first time in 85 years that the newfound clip is being released to the public, the NFSA said. It was found within a forgotten 1935 travelogue called ""Tasmania the Wonderland,"" by researchers at the Tasmanian Tiger Archives, a group that documents thylacine-related material.

In the newly discovered clip, zookeeper Arthur Reid and an associate rattle the thylacine's cage, likely to get the predator to act up or do one of its ""threat yawns,"" which can be seen in this 1933 video clip.

That thylacine's ""yawn"" was meant to be menacing to anything threatening it, Cameron Campbell, curator of the Thylacine Museum website, told NPR in 2014. Both clips, the 1933 one and the newfound clip, show the last captive thylacine, nicknamed Benjamin, although the creature's sex is still unknown.

It's thought that the 9-minute-long ""Tasmania the Wonderland"" was filmed by Sidney Cook (1873–1937), a Brisbane-based filmmaker and exhibitor. It was recorded more than 12 months after the last-known footage of a thylacine, which was taken in December 1933.

Months after this newfound 1935 clip was taken, Benjamin died on Sept. 7, 1936. Even though it was the last thylacine in captivity, its body was not preserved, NPR reported. Thylacines were once common in Tasmania, but their numbers plummeted after Europeans settled there in 1803, according to a 2013 study in the Journal of Animal Ecology , which found that humans alone were responsible for the marsupial's demise .

Despite the dearth of thylacine footage, the NFSA said it's possible that more film may yet be uncovered. Thylacines were shown in zoos in Australia as well as in big cities around the world, including Washington, D.C., New York, London, Antwerp and Berlin; so perhaps unreleased photos or film exist from one of these places, the NFSA said.

""Remaining to be uncovered are footage of a thylacine in color, roaming in the wild or — most hopefully — film with location sound that reveals any sound made by the animal,"" the NFSA wrote in the statement."~[]

The wheels of justice have turned slowly for endangered migratory falcons and resident raptors. The pace gathered momentum last week. In a series of raids and crackdowns on a section of pigeon fanciers of Punjab who were slaughtering raptors such as the Tundra Peregrine falcon, the Punjab Wildlife Preservation wing arrested two fanciers from Sandoha village of Bathinda district and questioned another fancier from Gharuan village near Mohali. The wildlife officials also arrested two youths from village Lahora near Ludhiana, who were in illegal possession of two specimens of the resident raptor, the Black kite.

The raids were launched in response to exposé in the Wildbuzz column on April 22, 2018, and May 10, 2020. This writer had furnished brutal ISIS-style videos of raptor slaughter to the highest authorities at the level of the Union ministry of environment and forests, National Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, the Punjab Wildlife Preservation wing and the International Convention on Migratory Species Office, Abu Dhabi, in April 2018 and May 2020. India is a signatory to this Convention on the protection of all raptors.

Confirming the crackdown, Punjab principal chief conservator (wildlife), Dr Kuldeep Kumar, told this writer: “We are going to go strictly by the law. Raptors such as falcons enjoy the highest protection under the laws and it is a non-bailable offence. We want to put an end to this practise once and for all. We had earlier launched a sensitisation and awareness campaign in Punjab to get pigeon fanciers not to kill raptors. We aim to also find out to whom the pigeon fanciers have passed on the falcons or sold them after capture, if they did not kill them.”

Irked by raptors such as the Shikra, Eurasian Sparrow hawk, and the migratory Tundra Peregrine and Laggar falcons preying on their expensive pigeons, some fanciers captured raptors and made videos that were posted on TikTok and YouTube and went viral on WhatsApp. Some of these latest videos, which draw a huge number of views, ‘likes’ and ‘shares’, show gruesome beheading of the raptors or simply the wrenching off of the falcon’s head by a muscular Punjabi hand. Pigeon fanciers also shoot down falcons and make videos of that illegal act. Rogue pigeon fanciers in other states of India and Pakistan are also believed to indulge in this brutal killing.

Acting on a coordinated drive initiated by Dr Kumar, divisional forest officer (DFO), wildlife, at Bathinda, Swarn Singh, traced the pigeon fanciers to Sandoha village who had trapped a falcon from a high tower and then passed it off to someone else. The two videos showing the illegal acts by the Sandoha pigeon fanciers had been sent to the wildlife authorities by this writer in April 2018. “The persons arrested from village Sandoha near Maur are Gurprit Singh Mand and Nirmal Singh Billa. We have asked the Police to trace the person to whom the fanciers passed on the falcon,” Swarn Singh told this writer.

A team from the Ropar wildlife division led by DFO, wildife, Monika Yadav and range forest officer, Prem Singh, traced Gurvinder Singh from villager Gharuan, who had put up videos of him wrenching off the head of a falcon. “We have questioned him and taken his statement. He will be produced before the court,” Yadav told this writer. While the pigeon fanciers from Sandhoa village were arrested on the basis of the offending videos, the wildlife wing is yet to initiate the arrest of Gurvinder Singh of Gharuan who had put up a number of videos displaying acts in violation of wildlife protection laws.

As part of the crackdown on rogue pigeon fanciers, a team led by DFO, Phillaur, Khushwinder Singh, nabbed two youths of village Lahora near Ludhiana. “Though it does not seem they were pigeon fanciers, they had two Black kites in their possession. We are questioning them and one of them is Gurprit Singh,” Khushwinder Singh told this writer.

John Slattery, 30, from County Limerick was arrested by armed gardaí on Friday, May 22, and extradited to the US to face the charges.

Slattery is accused of traveling to Texas along with two others and purchasing horns valued at $18,000 from a taxidermy shop through a third-party buyer known as a ""straw buyer."" US authorities allege that Slattery then brought the horns to New York and sold them for around $50,000.

He is also accused of falsifying a bill of sale to make it look as though the transaction in Texas had been legal and authorities claim that he added a false and fictitious Fish and Wildlife Service Emblem to the document to make it look authentic.

Authorities additionally allege that Slattery and his accomplices bought a consignment of black and white rhino horns on two separate occasions in Missouri in 2010.

Slattery made his initial appearance in the Western District Court of Texas before U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeffrey C. Manske to face the charges on Tuesday, May 26.

The Journal reported in April that it was ""virtually certain"" that Slattery would serve a one-year sentence in a Texas prison.

He was arrested last August and held in Irish prison until April when he was released on bail. He was due to be extradited to the US earlier in the year, but the extradition was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Around 20 armed gardaí arrested him at his house on Friday, May 22, and surrendered him to the US Marshall Service at Dublin Airport. His bail was due to expire later that evening.

The US Department of Justice said in a statement that Slattery's court appearance concluded the extradition process from Ireland.

""The Justice Department extends its gratitude to the government of Ireland for its cooperation and assistance,"" the statement read.

A British conservationist in Hong Kong has revealed his shock after finding the grave of a Mansfield police constable who was 'mauled by a tiger' more than 100 years ago.

Andy Cornish, who works for the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in Hong Kong, found the tomb of Ernest Goucher while out on a walk where he lives.

Mr Cornish, who leads the WWF's global shark programme, studied at the University of Nottingham for five years and said he was ""stunned"" when he found the gravestone.

The stone is in memory of Mr Goucher, a constable of Hong Kong police but originally from Mansfield, who died on duty following the tiger mauling on March 12, 1915.

The stone reads: ""In loving memory of Ernest Goucher, a native of Mansfield, Notts, constable, Hong Kong Police, who, while on duty in the new territory, was mauled by a tiger and died from his wounds on 12th March 1915 aged 21 years.

""Erected by his comrades as a mark of esteem. Gone but not forgotten.""

Mr Cornish explains that the Mansfield officer was attacked by a South China tiger, which occasionally killed people during this period.

He says he stumbled upon the grave after visiting an old cemetery in his area.

""I’d never visited this particularly cemetery before, which I believe is one of the oldest here"", he told Nottinghamshire Live.

""I came in a side entrance and almost immediately found myself in an old area that must have been designated for police and military.

""Gravestones were much more graphic back then, and would describe how people had perished, possibly as they were commissioned by colleagues rather than family.

""I’m aware that we used to have South China tigers occasionally in Hong Kong and that they had killed people, but was stunned to find a gravestone for Ernest Goucher – from Mansfield of all places – who had been killed by one 100 years previously.

""Hong Kong still has forested areas with remote villages, but it is staggering to imagine two metre tigers wandering wild here, and tragically the South China tiger is now long extinct.

""It was certainly a memorable find."""~[]

May 28, 2020

Two greater one-horned rhino calves, along with their mothers, bravely entered the expansive Asian Savanna habitat for the first time, (May 20, 2020) at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. Mother rhinos Asha and Tanaya gave birth to their calves a little over two weeks apart—on March 25 and April 11, respectively. Both mom-and-calf pairs have enjoyed plenty of private time bonding before interacting with other wildlife on the savanna.

Tanaya and her female calf, which has not yet been named, were the first to emerge from their private time together. The little calf boldly followed her protective mom over to one of her favorite spots—a mud wallow—where they both took a cool dip. The calf, which never ventured more than a few feet from her mom, appeared to enjoy the water before heading out to explore more of the savanna. There, she met a herd of blackbuck antelope, as well as other animals that share the 40-acre expanse with the greater one-horned rhinos.

San Diego Zoo

Asha and her male calf, named Arjun (a Hindi name with several meanings, including confidence and power), were next to venture out onto the savanna. The doting mom cautiously led her calf, exploring the hills and grassy areas. The little calf, who appeared to get bolder by the minute, ventured several feet away from his mom—but when he came face-to-face with a Javan bantang, Arjun promptly ""hoofed"" it back to his mother's side. After exploring, the mom-and-calf pair also cooled off in a mud wallow.

""It's great to see Asha and Tanaya introducing their calves to other wildlife for the first time,"" said Jillian King, senior wildlife care specialist, San Diego Zoo Safari Park. ""Everything is new to the calves right now, so it will be interesting to watch them explore. We will keep a watchful eye on them, and look forward to them meeting more of the wildlife on the savanna soon.""

San Diego Zoo

The greater one-horned rhinoceros was once widespread in Southeast Asia, but it is now found only in India and Nepal. It differs from other rhino species, as it has an armor-plated appearance—but that ""armor"" is actually a layer of skin that has many folds. While the two calves explored, a layer of young, pink skin could be spied underneath the folds of their thickening, dark gray top layer of skin.

The greater one-horned rhino is listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species, primarily due to habitat loss, poaching threats and illegal traffic in rhino horn. There are an estimated 3,500 greater one-horned rhinos remaining in the wild, with over 70 percent of the population living in one reserve: Kaziranga National Park in India.

Rhinos are very important to the ecosystems in which they reside. Greater one-horned rhinos live in humid, swampy, tall-grass habitats. These large herbivores graze on the grass, which helps to maintain the habitat—increasing plant diversity and providing grazing areas for other animals. Rhinos digest large volumes of plant material and disperse the seeds in their dung, thus playing an important role in the health and maintenance of vegetation in their habitat. As rhinos disappear from their habitats, their absence impacts other species, such as birds, reptiles, mammals and plants.

San Diego Zoo

San Diego Zoo Global has been working for more than 40 years, along with other accredited zoos, to keep a sustainable population of rhinos safe under human care while working to protect them in sanctuaries in the wild. These recent births represent the 74th and 75th greater one-horned rhinos born at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park since 1975, making the Safari Park the most successful conservation organization at increasing the population of this animal in the world.

Every day—especially now, during the Safari Park closure due to COVID-19—San Diego Zoo Global is grateful to the donors, members and general public who support the organization's conservation goals. This support allows both the Zoo and Safari Park to continue caring for wildlife, including the two new rhino calves. Recognizing that Zoo and Safari Park members have not been able to visit during the closure, memberships that were active as of March 16, 2020, will automatically receive an extension when the Zoo and Safari Park reopen that matches the entire duration of the closure. Visit SanDiegoZoo.org for more information on membership extension, and to stay updated on additional offerings to stay connected to wildlife from San Diego Zoo Global.

At the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, more than one million guests each year see animals in herds of mixed species in expansive habitats. Safari tours offer savanna views of African and Asian animals, and trails take visitors to experience Australian and North American habitats, plus opportunities for up-close encounters and unique behind-the-scenes perspectives. Known for its leadership in rhino conservation, the Safari Park is home to the Nikita Kahn Rhino Rescue Center, which is devoted to groundbreaking work to bring back the northern white rhino. As visitors discover the rare and endangered species at the Safari Park, they are directly contributing, through admissions and on-grounds sales, to the efforts of San Diego Zoo Global, an international nonprofit conservation organization that works to fight extinction through recovery efforts for plants and animals worldwide.

gap stay australia beyond ~"Giant pandas Wang Wang and Fu Ni remain content and locked down in their Australian home at the Adelaide Zoo.

But despite being on loan until 2024, the bamboo-munching funsters had better not get too comfortable.

As Australasia’s only breeding pair of giant pandas they’ve enjoyed a laid-back, sunny lifestyle and a stream of visitors since moving into their shared home in 2009.

The coronavirus stopped all that.

Not only were the visitors banned, but outside their serene walls sickness and economic ferment overtook the narrative between their home and adopted nation, to the extent that nothing can be taken for granted.

China’s so-called ‘panda diplomacy’ has been one way the growing superpower has extended its influence to friends and trading partners around the world – although sometimes, when things get black and white in diplomatic terms, the cuddly ones are recalled.

Now, even the pandas can’t hide the tension.

In the Pacific, China is splashing billions of dollars on infrastructure projects and health care.

Indeed China’s Pacific plan has been so successful in co-opting our near-neighbours that despite the federal government’s cutting of foreign aid budgets, funding in the Pacific has for the most part been quarantined from cuts in a bid to match the largesse.

It’s also pushing its own barrow through the Belt and Road co-operation and trade initiative that the Victorian government is keen on, but which has met with criticism from the federal government this week.

And then there’s China’s cash splash in Australian education institutions, a trend that has brought into question that sector’s reliance on fee-paying students.

Graeme Smith, a research fellow at the Department of Pacific Affairs, Coral Bell School of Asia Pacific Affairs, Australian National University

says China’s attempts at world influence ultimately stems from its domestic intrigues.

“In terms of how we think of soft power in Australia – has China become more attractive to the Australian public – then China’s expensive soft power push has been a colossal failure,” Dr Smith told The New Daily.

“But that’s not the metrics they’re using.

The main target of soft power politics is the tens of millions of cadres who make up the CCP, to reassure them that Xi Jinping is confident, assured and strong in his foreign policy.’’



The increasing fault lines between the United States and China – which started with Donald Trump’s complaints on trade and have escalated to his suggestion the coronavirus outbreak began in a Wuhan laboratory – is making things increasingly difficult for Australia.

After Australia took the lead in seeking an independent inquiry into the pandemic outbreak, China upped its rhetoric, with government mouthpiece the Global Times describing Australia as a “giant kangaroo that acts as the dog of the US”.

That’s more cat scratch than warm and fuzzy giant pandas.

Things got serious though when China slapped a 80 per cent tariff on Australian barley imports, claiming they were against trade rules.

Trade Minister Simon Birmingham also conceded that his Chinese counterpart is not taking his calls, a move he said was “disappointing”.

“The Australian government will always front up to have a conversation, even where we have disagreements,” Mr Birmingham said.

“We think the best way to move through those disagreements is to engage in dialogue.”

The $90 billion economic imperative has often kept Australia on a tightrope when dealing with its largest trading partner, but Victoria University researchers last year suggested that skirmishes over trade may well be overplayed.

They claimed the nation needs to distinguish between a commodity downturn or Chinese economic downturn that would smash iron ore exports and one-off trade snubs caused by diplomatic stoushes.

The big caveat though was education, with Australian universities now heavily reliant on fee-paying Chinese students – a model that has been criticised inside and outside the educational field.

In October the ABC’s Four Corners revealed the Chinese government had co-funded at least four courses at the University of Queensland.

The university’s courses were developed in partnership with its Confucius Institute, one of 13 such Chinese government-funded soft power centres in Australia, which run language and culture classes.

Dr Smith says Australia must recognise that some universities and business schools have been forced by budget cuts to look elsewhere for cash and, in doing so, some have “gone over the top” in tailoring courses to boost revenue and provide a pathway to residency.

He said this approach was not good for Australia or the Chinese students – many of whom may wonder why they paid so much money to sit in a classroom where 90 per cent of their classmates are also from China.

“There were serious issues around mental health and social isolation for this cohort even before the virus hit,” Dr Smith said.

“The call to diversify is sensible, and many universities haven’t pursued this seriously enough … the hard reality is there is no other region which can easily take the place of the PRC – the potential student numbers from India, South-East Asia and Brazil don’t come close.

Feng Chongyi, Associate Professor in China Studies at the University of Technology Sydney, says ultimately the soft power push needs to be met with some hard truths about Australia’s values.

Dr Feng has long been critical of Chinese government influence in local Chinese media and on campuses.

In 2017 he was detained in China for 10 days while visiting his mother, and does not see any short-term easing of tensions while the Chinese government remains so hostile to criticism.

“There is nothing wrong for Australia to support the US as a trustworthy partner of democratic alliance,” Dr Feng told The New Daily.

“China’s displeasure stems from the nature of the CCP regime, which has become increasingly hostile to liberal international order and universal values of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in recent years.

Australia is entitled to pursue foreign policies in line with its national interests and core values such as human rights, democracy, equality and the rule of law.



“Australia’s relationship with China can be improved if the CCP regime changes its hostility toward universal values and bullying behaviours.”

Dr Feng says Australia cannot afford to try and balance its relationship between the US and China, saying: “Prime Minister Scott Morrison gets it right to characterise the US as an ally and China a business partner”.

“It is wrong to put autocratic China and democratic USA on a par and absolutely right for Australia to side with its democratic ally, USA, when liberal and democratic principles are challenged by the CCP regime.”

And the way forward?

“In dealing with communist China, Australia has to stand firm in upholding its core values and protecting the integrity of its political institutions, educational institutions and business practice and do its best in minimising the negative impact of the CCP united front operations.”

It seems Adelaide’s giant pandas will need to produce lot of bamboo-chewing cuteness if they’re to bridge the gap and stay in Australia beyond 2024."~['US', 'US', 'US', 'US']
