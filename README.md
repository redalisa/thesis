# Animals of the Digital Age 

The following notebooks outline the processing steps for my thesis data. Data acquisition is done separately but some visualizations are combined in notebooks with the retrieval of other data. Some notebooks display analysis and/or visualizations that ultimately were not used in the final written work.

Datasets are not included due to size limits of the repository. Can be shared upon request.
