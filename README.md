# Animals of the Digital Age 

The notebooks in this repository outline the processing steps for my thesis data. Data acquisition is done separately but some visualizations are combined in notebooks with the retrieval of other data. Some notebooks display analysis and/or visualizations that ultimately were not used in the final written work.

#### Notebook with processing:  
[First-processing-steps.ipynb](https://github.com/redalisa/thesis/blob/main/First-data-processing-steps.ipynb)
  
#### General visualizations and inspection of the Google News dataset:  
[General-visualization.ipynb  ](https://github.com/redalisa/thesis/blob/main/General_Visualizations.ipynb)

#### Extracting geographic content from the article text:  
[Geoapify.ipynb](https://github.com/redalisa/thesis/blob/main/Geoapify.ipynb)  

#### Fetching Google Search results of each species' scientific name  
[Google_hits.ipynb](https://github.com/redalisa/thesis/blob/main/Google_hits.ipynb)  

#### Gathering Facebook shares from SharedCount's API  
[SharedCount.ipynb](https://github.com/redalisa/thesis/blob/main/SharedCount.ipynb)  

#### Collecting Wikipedia Pageviews and visualizations of multiple data metrics  
[Wikipageviews.ipynb](https://github.com/redalisa/thesis/blob/main/Wikipageviews.ipynb)    
  

      
  
The original dataset and processed datasets are not included due to the size limits of the repository. Can be shared upon request. The unprocessed dataset can be directly accessed from: https://etsin.fairdata.fi/dataset/a222ce79-6448-4942-b154-02d55df66a2e  


### APIs used:

SharedCount API (to gather Facebook engagement of news articles) https://www.sharedcount.com/

Wikimedia REST API (to collect Wikipedia Pageviews) https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/

Custom Search JSON API (to collect Google Search results) https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/overview


For faster data acquisition paid versions of the following APIs were used: SharedCount and GoogleSearch
