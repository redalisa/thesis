The Giant Jumping Rat, another oddity from Madagascar



The Giant Jumping Rat, another peculiarity from Madagascar

Madagascar is home to an assortment of bizarre animals from lemurs to hedgehog-like tenrecs to brightly colored geckos. Due to its geographic isolation, about three-fourths of its species are found nowhere else on the planet and the island lacks many of the animals found elsewhere in the world. Naturally absent from Madagascar are dogs, rabbits, cats, monkeys, squirrels, pangolins, toads, montior lizards; adders, vipers, cobras, pythons, hornbills, woodpeckers, and a host of other animals you might expect to find due to their prevelance in regions near the island. In their place, vacant ecological niches are filled by unqiuely native Malagasy species. Among these species is the Giant Jumping Rat (Hypogeomys antimena), an animal that can be compared to a rabbit both in terms of its appearance and its role in the ecosystem.

The giant jumping rat is the largest rodent in Madagascar, roughly equivilant in size to a rabbit. Also like a rabbit, the giant jumping rat has long pointed ears, short fur and large rear feet which are used for jumping. The giant jumping rat can leap almost three feet (one meter) into the air to avoid predators — namely the puma-like fossa which is actually related to the mongoose and the Madagascar ground boa.

Giant jumping rats are found in the dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar, especially around the town of Morondava. Perhaps the best place to see these creatures is at Kirindy, a protected area with tourist facilities located about two hours from Morondava. Kirindy doubles as a research center; one which has uncovered much of what we know about this species.

Extensive burrows

Again, like rabbits, giant jumping rats live in burrows. These typically consist of a complex of tunnels, each around 18 inches (45cm) in diameter, up to 17 feet (5 meters) long and a yard (one meter) underground. A family unit, consisting of a monogamous pair and offspring, generally lives in a burrow and maintains a territory covering 7-10 acres (3-4 hectares) — although this expands in the dry seasons when food is scarce.

Nocturnal, giant jumping rats leave their burrow at dusk to feed on fallen fruit and seeds. Food is consumed in a manner similar to squirrels whereby it is held in the forepaws and manipulated in the mouth while the rat sits semi-upright on its haunches.

According to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, a nonprofit dedicated to the protection of Madagascar’s unique species, in the wild giant jumping rats are born at the start of the warm rainy season in late November and early December. A litter generally consists of one or two young who stay with their parents for varying amounts of time depending on their sex; 2 to 3 years for female offspring and 1 to 2 years for young males. In captivity giant jumping rats have life expectancy of 5 years.

A species on the brink

Like many animals in Madagascar, giant jumping rats are highly endangered due to habitat loss and predation from introduced species. Currently listed on the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List for endangered species, the population is estimated at around 11,000. According to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in May 2001 a computer modeling technique, called a Population Habitat Viability Analysis, “predicted that at the current rates of habitat loss and predation, the giant jumping rat would be extinct in the wild within about 24 years.” The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust is currently working with local Malagasy to prevent this outcome. The Trust has also established a captive breeding program in an effort to restore the population of the species.

1,"Wildlife area to be established in Danda

Wild BOUNTY: The planned area will be the largest in Taiwan, and contains a diverse array of rare plants, birds and animals, including the Taiwan blue magpie

Staff Writer, with CNA





The Forestry Bureau yesterday said it planned to establish a new wildlife management area — the nation’s largest — in the Danda (丹大) area of Nantou County, amid renewed efforts to monitor and protect the environment and promote biological diversity and a sustainable ecological environment.

The bureau said it would develop the protected area in terms of the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法). It will consist of 109,952 hectares in the mountainous area, making it the country’s largest wildlife conservation area.

The Nantou Forest District Office said the planned Danda -wildlife conservation area contains a diverse array of organisms. Aside from rare animals, there are also rare plants, such as red and yellow cypresses, Taiwan yews, firs, Torreya trees and orchids, as well as plant species on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

A Leopard Cat (Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis) is pictured in a file photo provided by the Nantou Forest District Office, which yesterday announced plans to establish a wildlife management station in the Danda area of Nantou County. Photo: Courtesy of the Nantou Forest District Office

The bureau’s monitoring records show that endangered mammals in the area include Formosan macaques, pangolins, Formosan clouded leopards, Formosan bears, yellow-throated martens, ferrets, weasels, brown Mino cats, muntjacs, Taiwan mountain goats and Formosan sambars.

The protected bird species are also diverse and include the crested goshawk, the crested serpent eagle, the forest eagle, the bear eagle, the Swinhoe’s pheasant, the green pigeon, the brown wood owl, the grey owl, the spotted Scops owl (Otus spilocephalus), the small swallowtail, the white-tailed robin, the yellow-bellied fairy flycatcher, the Huangshan bird, the green-backed tit, the Taiwan Dai Ju and the Taiwan blue magpie.

Liu Fu-cheng (劉福成), director of the forest’s district office, said ecological conservation was an important international issue and the creation of the conservation area would help protect biological diversity and provide useful resources for ecological research and monitoring.

2,"There are over 1,100 species of bats worldwide, with at least 121 species found in Guyana and 86 found within the Iwokrama forest. They are found on every continent except for Antarctica, feed at every level of the ecosystem and are the only, true, flying mammal. The smallest bat measures around 3 cm in length with wingspans of 15 cm, whilst the largest measures around 15 cm with wingspans about 1.5 m in length.

Bats are usually considered a pest. However the benefits derived from bats outweigh any negative impacts. For example, 70 % of all bats feed on insects such as flies and mosquitoes, helping to keep these and other pests at bay. Bats also feed on fruits and are therefore responsible for the pollination, seed-dispersal and distribution of many important forest and agricultural plants (such as bananas, cashews, breadfruit and mangoes) from which we derive an estimated 443 useful products.

One of the main fears about bats is their ability to contract and pass on the rabies virus. Rabies, however, is only passed on through a bite from the infected animal or through direct contact with infected fluids, eg saliva or blood in an open wound. If a bat is seen late in the day flying erratically or appears disoriented it should not be approached or handled. Assume that the animal is sick and keep away. Very few bats actually spread rabies because most of the animals become too sick to fly and die soon after the disease develops. Vampire bats are one species known to cause rabies outbreaks; however, many beneficial species are killed in the attempt to control the vampire bat population.

Rain forests are rich in biodiversity and are home to many different plants and animals. Indigenous communities also make their homes there. Even if you don’t live in the rain forest, humans rely on the forest for resources such as building materials (wood and lianas), medicine and fruits. Rain forests also provide essential environmental services for life on earth; they create soil as well as prevent soil erosion, produce oxygen though photosynthesis, maintain clean water systems, and are a key defence against climate change.

3,"A new population of the Andean cat, a house cat-sized feline thought to live exclusively in the high mountains of South America, has been discovered at lower elevations, extending the range of the endangered and elusive species.

Previously, it was believed the Andean cat lived only at and above elevations of 9,800 feet (3,000 meters), among the arid, rocky slopes of the high Andes. However, a lone photograph of two Andean cats in the foothills of central Argentina, captured in 2004, prompted a search for the species in the region.

Survey results show evidence of the cats at elevations as low as 2,100 feet (650 meters) in the Patagonian steppe region.

""These confirmed records show the lowest elevations ever reported for the Andean cat,"" said the Wildlife Conservation Society's Andres Novaro, lead author of the study, adding that, according to genetic analysis, ""this new population appears to represent an evolutionary lineage distinct from the highland population.""

The research team surveyed approximately 12,000 square miles (31,000 square kilometers) of Argentina's Mendoza and Neuquén provinces from 2007 to 2009. The team collected samples from several locations that included scat, skulls and skin, all of which were confirmed using DNA analysis to belong to Andean cats.

In addition, the researchers conducted surveys with inhabitants of the region.

The Andean cat's range extension coincides with the known distribution of the mountain vizcacha, a rabbitlike rodent that inhabits both the Andes Mountains and Patagonian steppe and is the Andean cat's primary prey.

The conservationists also found evidence of three other small cat species: Geoffroy's cat, pampas cat and jaguarundi.

Mariana Varese, acting director of WCS's Latin America and Caribbean Program, said the newly discovered range of Andean cats will help conservationists form better plans to protect the rare species.

As few as 2,500 Andean cats survive throughout the cats' entire range, according to the WCS.

Threats to the newly discovered population of Andean cat include goat herders who assume the felines are preying on their livestock, oil exploration activities that destroy habitat, and new roads that open up formerly inaccessible areas to poachers.",Rare Andean Cats Discovered in New Locale,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVzY2llbmNlLmNvbS8xMzI5Mi1hbmRlYW4tY2F0cy1kaXNjb3ZlcmVkLmh0bWzSAUFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vYW1wLzEzMjkyLWFuZGVhbi1jYXRzLWRpc2NvdmVyZWQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5uF5HboEYgWDVSeL9FMxPU-1200-80.jpg,2011-03-17,"{'sent': 'Previously, it was believed the Andean cat lived only at and above elevations of 9,800 feet (3,000 meters), among the arid, rocky slopes of the high Andes.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['3,000 meters', '9,800 feet']}}","A new population of the Andean cat, a house cat-sized feline thought to live exclusively in the high mountains of South America, has been discovered at lower elevations, extending the range of the endangered and elusive species.

4,"Kakapo chick Solstice One nibbles on Stephen Jaquiery's ear. Photo by Liz Whitewell.

Sirocco, the kakapo due to be on display at Orokonui Ecosanctuary, in Dunedin, in September, has never mated with another kakapo but became an overnight YouTube sensation after being filmed getting amorous on BBC TV presenter Mark Carwardine's head. More than three million viewers watched his randy gyrations and listened to Stephen Fry's delightfully amused commentary.

Kakapo demand attention. They are exceedingly rare, large, unusual, endearing, long-lived and have the appeal of a kitten, with the beard of an old man.

I had my own enchanting encounter with Solstice One. As a sickly chick, this bird was nursed back to health earlier this year at Wellington Zoo by Lisa Argilla, who is now looking after wayward emperor penguin Happy Feet.

A small population of Campbell Island teal are breeding on Codfish Island. Photo by Stephen Jaquiery.

Despite being released with a wild population on Codfish Island, this bird still seeks out human company. I was with Doc rangers carrying out weight and health checks on the recently released chicks when Solstice One decided to climb me like a tree.

Taking a mouthful of clothing with its strong beak, followed up by a three-clawed grip one foot at a time, Solstice One climbed expertly on to my shoulder and proceeded to nibble on one earlobe, then the other. Judging by the blood drawn on the ranger's hands I knew a painful bite could follow, but Solstice One seemed content with just an exploratory grinding chew on both ears and a peck at what was left of my hair before settling down and preparing to go to sleep.

As enthralling as that was, later that afternoon I encountered more birds equally rare. In fact these little fellows, who in comparison with the publicity kakapo receive have flown under the radar, were thought to be extinct for 150 years.

Not far from the Doc hut on Codfish Island in a small tannin-coloured creek is a resident population of Campbell Island teal. These, the rarest ducks in the world, are nocturnal and flightless. A small population of 20 survivors was rediscovered on the 23ha Dent Island, off Campbell Island, in 1975.

Three of these little cuties made themselves known as I crossed their creek and as I sat still they waddled over and pecked my boots but scuttled away at my slightest movement.

5,"The Iwokrama Forest and Rupununi Wetlands are home to healthy populations of Guyana’s Giants. While this is impressive, these giants are rare and in many cases, endangered, despite being large. Ironically, these giants are very hard to see throughout most of their range as they are at the top of the food chains and need a lot of space to roam and hunt. Keystone species are important for maintaining balance in ecosystems and ecosystem functions; if keystone species are removed, it can lead to cascading changes in other species populations, disrupt the population balances of other animals that they would have preyed on as well as natural ecological functions such as seed dispersal and plant structure in a forest.

Visitors to the Iwokrama Rain Forest and Rupununi Wetlands stand a good chance of seeing some of the world’s most impressive and endangered giants: the Puma and Jaguar are two of the largest terrestrial carnivores in South America; the Harpy Eagle is a massive aerial predator and the largest eagle in South America, the Jabiru stork is the tallest flying bird in the Americas and the King Vulture is the largest of the New World vultures. The Giant River Otter is the largest otter in the world and the Capybara is the world’s largest rodent. The Arapaima is the world’s largest, scaled freshwater fish and is unique in that it is an obligate air breather that cares for its young by providing nutrition from “milk” secreted from its head. The Giant River Turtle and Black Caiman are two extraordinarily large reptiles, and while endangered in most of their range in South America, maintain healthy populations in Iwokrama and the Rupununi. The Anaconda is the world’s heaviest snake and the Bird Eating Spider is the largest spider in the world.

Unfortunately, hunting and habitat destruction threaten large predators worldwide; in Guyana, we have an opportunity to maintain a healthy environment though management. These large animals are also central to tourism development, and can generate more income alive than dead. The Giants are Guyana’s flagship species and with management and maintenance actions, we can ensure this rich natural heritage for generations to come.

Rain forests are rich in biodiversity and are home to many different plants and animals as well as indigenous communities. Humans, even those who don’t live in the rain forest, rely on it for resources such as building materials (wood and lianas), medicine and fruits. Rain forests also provide essential environmental services for life on earth; they create soil as well as prevent soil erosion, produce oxygen though photosynthesis, maintain clean water systems, and are a key defence against climate change.

While this is impressive, these giants are rare and in many cases, endangered, despite being large. Ironically, these giants are very hard to see throughout most of their range as they are at the top of the food chains and need a lot of space to roam and hunt. Keystone species are important for maintaining balance in ecosystems and ecosystem functions; if keystone species are removed, it can lead to cascading changes in other species populations, disrupt the population balances of other animals that they would have preyed on as well as natural ecological functions such as seed dispersal and plant structure in a forest.

Visitors to the Iwokrama Rain Forest and Rupununi Wetlands stand a good chance of seeing some of the world’s most impressive and endangered giants: the Puma and Jaguar are two of the largest terrestrial carnivores in South America; the Harpy Eagle is a massive aerial predator and the largest eagle in South America, the Jabiru stork is the tallest flying bird in the Americas and the King Vulture is the largest of the New World vultures. The Giant River Otter is the largest otter in the world and the Capybara is the world’s largest rodent. The Arapaima is the world’s largest, scaled freshwater fish and is unique in that it is an obligate air breather that cares for its young by providing nutrition from “milk” secreted from its head. The Giant River Turtle and Black Caiman are two extraordinarily large reptiles, and while endangered in most of their range in South America, maintain healthy populations in Iwokrama and the Rupununi. The Anaconda is the world’s heaviest snake and the Bird Eating Spider is the largest spider in the world.

Unfortunately, hunting and habitat destruction threaten large predators worldwide; in Guyana, we have an opportunity to maintain a healthy environment though management. These large animals are also central to tourism development, and can generate more income alive than dead. The Giants are Guyana’s flagship species and with management and maintenance actions, we can ensure this rich natural heritage for generations to come.

Rain forests are rich in biodiversity and are home to many different plants and animals as well as indigenous communities. Humans, even those who don’t live in the rain forest, rely on it for resources such as building materials (wood and lianas), medicine and fruits. Rain forests also provide essential environmental services for life on earth; they create soil as well as prevent soil erosion, produce oxygen though photosynthesis, maintain clean water systems, and are a key defence against climate change.

6,"A snow leopard visits its relic site in Wangchuck Centennial Park, Bhutan. This is a spot where it repeatedly marks its territory.

Amazing new video and still images of snow leopards and their prey were captured during the first-ever survey of snow leopard prey in Bhutan's newest national park.

The new footage includes snow leopards engaging in scent-marking, which marks a leopard's turf, and a sub-adult snow leopard. The pictures are valuable because these elegant and elusive creatures aren't easy to photograph: Last year, scientists captured the first images of snow leopards in Siberia, and a rare image of a mother and cub in the Afghanistan mountains.

Snow leopards have even been known to steal wildlife cameras.

The new survey in Bhutan also took pictures of other species, such as a healthy population of blue sheep, which is the main food source for snow leopards. These new images are the first pictorial-based evidence that snow leopards are thriving in Wangchuck Centennial Park, a vital snow leopard corridor between Jigme Dorji National Park in the West and Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary in the East. Field biologists from the Government of Bhutan and the conservation group WWF captured more than 10,000 images during the camera trap survey.

The survey was focused on snow leopard prey species, but the scientists also captured images and footage of the Tibetan wolf, threatened Himalayan serow, musk deer, wild dog, red fox, Pika, pheasants and several birds of prey.

""The findings are phenomenal as these are the first snow leopard images recorded in Wangchuck Centennial Park,"" said WWF's Rinjan Shrestha, who led the survey team. ""It suggests that the network of protected areas and corridors is helping to link local snow leopard populations, which will be invaluable to ensure long-term persistence of snow leopards in the region.""

7,"Infrared camera captures wild Formosan black bear

By Lee I-chia / Staff reporter





Thanks to the application of an infrared surveillance camcorder with thermal sensors, the Forestry Bureau yesterday said it has recorded a number of rare images of protected wild animals, including clear footage of the endangered Formosan black bear, in the forests near Taitung County’s Luye (鹿野) and Guanshan (關山) townships.

The bureau said it began installing infrared cameras in national forests nationwide in the 1980s to gather information on the wildlife in protected areas. However, the cameras had mechanical limits and gathering long-term images of wild animals was difficult.

Two years ago, the bureau installed 12 infrared camcorders in mountainous areas in the hope of gathering more information about the behavior of wild animals. The camcorders were fitted with thermal sensors that cause the cameras to shoot footage automatically for periods of 10 seconds when triggered.

The signature white V-shaped marking on the chest of an endangered Formosan black bear is clearly visible in this undated image captured by an infrared camera in the Luye mountain area of Taitung County. Photo: CNA, courtesy of the Taitung Forest District Office

“The camcorders use thermal sensors that automatically start recording when they sense heat within five meters,” said Lo Shuang-hsi (羅雙喜), an executive at the bureau’s Taitung Forest District Office. “We did have infrared cameras in the past, but they could not capture motion like the new ones.”

“In addition, the batteries in the old cameras did not last that long, so we had to go check on them very often,” he said. “They also needed film, so sometimes when we checked on the cameras, they had already run out of film, or their batteries had died before they ran out of film.”

Catching an image of a Formosan black bear walking past the camcorder for the first time in two years, the district office’s recreational section chief Huang Chium-tse (黃群策) said the bear was pictured at an altitude of about 850m, the lowest altitude at which a Formosan black bear has ever been sighted.

With a white “V” on its chest, a sturdy black body, round head, short neck and long snout, the Formosan black bear — the only native bear species in Taiwan — was listed as an endangered species by the Wildlife Conservation Act (野生動物保育法) in 1989.

Taiwan Black Bear Conservation chairperson Hwang Mei-hsiu (黃美秀) said the Formosan black bear is a very sensitive animal, often inhabiting deep -mountainous areas, adding that there are probably less than 1,000 bears left in Taiwan.

Aside from the bear, other rare wild animals were also recorded, including the Formosan serow, the Formosan sambar, the Formosan barking deer, the Formosan yellow-throated marten and the Swinhoe’s pheasant, the bureau said.",Infrared camera captures wild Formosan black bear,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhaXBlaXRpbWVzLmNvbS9OZXdzL3RhaXdhbi9hcmNoaXZlcy8yMDEyLzAzLzI4LzIwMDM1Mjg5MDXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2012/03/28/P02-120328-66.jpg,2012-03-28,"{'sent': 'Infrared camera captures wild Formosan black bear\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Formosan']}}","Infrared camera captures wild Formosan black bear

8,"Scientists in Cameroon have warned that eating monkeys and apes could cause the next HIV.

They are already tracking a HIV-like virus called simian foamy virus, and fear more viruses could spread and lead to a global health crisis.

80 per cent of the meat eaten in Cameroon is killed in the wild and is known as ‘bushmeat’,with gorilla, chimpanzee or monkey favourites.

Tonkin snub-nosed monkey: Monkeys and apes are targets for bushmeat - and scientists worry viruses could spread to humans

According to oneestimate, up to 3,000 gorillas are slaughtered in southern Cameroon every year.

Elsewhere, the Washington-based Bush Meat Crisis Task Force estimates that up to five milliontons of wild animals are being ‘harvested’ in the Congo Basin every year – the equivalent of 10 million cattle.



A study earlier this year by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), identified evidence of viruses,including simian foamy virus, in illegally imported wildlife products confiscated at several U.S. international airports, including John F. Kennedy International Airport, George Bush Intercontinental-Houston and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International.

Babila Tafon, headvet at the primate sanctuary Ape Action Africa (AAA), in Mefou, just outside the Cameroon capital Yaounde, has spotted the virus in animals brought to his sanctuary.

The AAA cares for22 gorillas and more than one hundred chimps which are orphans of the bush meat trade.

Mr Tafon tests the blood of all apes arriving at the sanctuary. He says he has recently detected the simian foamy virus, which is closely related to HIV, in the apes.

‘A recent surveyc onfirmed this is now in humans, especially in some of those who are huntersand cutting up the apes in the south-east of the country,’ he said.

He also believes that ebola may be present, and caused a recent mass death in a nearby village.

‘In the village of Bakaklion our brothers found a dead gorilla in the forest,’ said Felix Biango,a village elder.



‘They took it back to the village and ate the meat. Almost immediately, everyone died – 25 men, women and children – the only person whodidn't was a woman who didn't eat the meat.’

Professor Dominique Baudon, the director of the Pasteur Centre in Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital, says he is concerned viruses could quickly spread.

He says that the deeper poachers go in to the forest, and the more that primates are consumed,the more exposed people become to new unknown viruses and the more potential there is for the viruses to mutate into potentially aggressive forms.

Government researchers admit they do not know what the long term effects of SFV in humansare, and the Canadian government recently said they are not even sure how it is transmitted.

‘The exact method of transmission hasn't been confirmed, but there are indications that the virus may be transmitted through exposure to blood, saliva and other bodily fluids from affected animals,’ it said.

9,"Sometimes, though not very often, a science story starts off as a love story. And it's likely that no other tale of scientific discovery, particularly one that touches on some of the most frightening diseases on the planet, begins with one woman's enduring love for a boa constrictor named Larry.

Yet an attempt to save Larry set in motion a series of events, many outlandishly serendipitous, that allowed scientists to hunt down a virus new to science. The virus is apparently the culprit for an infamous and deadly scourge of captive snakes called inclusion body disease, or IBD.

The newfound pathogen is also related to viruses that cause nasty diseases in humans called viral hemorrhagic fevers. The most famous of these is Ebola.

When a California woman named Taryn Hook brought Larry — all 7 feet (2 meters) of him — to the vet a few years ago, she never imagined that the trip would one day lead to such a remarkable discovery, which was announced today (Aug. 14) in the journal mBio. [Read Larry the Snake's Story]

Snake story

IBD afflicts pythons and boa constrictors, causing a host of strange symptoms. The snakes tie themselves in knots, they projectile vomit and engage in an eerie behavior called stargazing; the snakes raise their heads over and over, stare into thin air, and sway drunkenly from side to side. [Image Gallery: Snakes of the World]

Biopsies from animals with the disease show their cells filled up with globules of proteins called inclusions, which may be responsible for the odd behaviors.

There's no cure for the disease. It moves swiftly in pythons, and can progress slowly in boa constrictors, but it is always fatal. And it's infectious, moving from snake to snake, though the mechanism of transmission isn't entirely clear. If one animal in a collection gets IBD, typically all the animals are euthanized.

Blood tests had suggested Larry, a Dumeril's boa constrictor, might have IBD. Wanting to know what could be done to save the beloved snake, Hook contacted Joseph DeRisi at the University of California, San Francisco, a virologist known for his work deciphering another mysterious virus, this one affecting macaws and parrots.

Her plea for help led DeRisi's lab to take on IBD. The scientists put out a call for samples of diseased and nondiseased snakes. Perhaps luckily, the Steinhart Aquarium at the California Academy of Sciences, just a few miles away, had a sudden outbreak of IBD.

Many snakes, both with and without IBD, had to be killed, providing the lab with plenty of freshly preserved tissue to start their investigation. [7 Shocking Snake Stories]

Postdoctoral researcher Mark Stenglein, the research's lead author, rifled through the genes of the dead snakes and soon had millions and millions of sequences. But to sort out which sequence might belong to any suspect viruses, he needed the ultimate genetic blueprint — the boa constrictor genome, which had never been put together.

Without the assembled genome, it would be extremely difficult to tell which sequences belonged to viruses that cause disease, and which were simply vestiges of viruses now rendered harmless by the rigors of time and evolution.

""They're the fossils of old infections,"" Stenglein said. ""They're in every genome. So if we saw those, they might have been confusing to us.""

Yet fate smiled upon the effort yet again. A contest called Assemblathon 2 — which pits different groups against each another in a kind of genome-off — was getting under way. They chose to take a stab at sequencing the red-tailed boa constrictor's genome, and Stenglein got his hands on the results.

Another wall

Yet to study a new virus, you must make more of it — which requires a host cell that will allow the virus to replicate itself. And here, Stenglein ran into yet another roadblock. He tried to grow the new virus in various animal cell lines — monkey cells, iguana cells, turtle cells, the cells of a viper — yet nothing worked. He needed a boa constrictor cell line. And since there was no existing boa constrictor cell line, he needed to start one himself.

""To do that, you need organs — tissue from the species,"" Stenglein said. ""And as you might imagine, you can't go buy boa constrictor kidneys at the supermarket.""

Kismet struck again, though this time the coincidence wasn't a happy one.

Chris Sanders, Larry's vet, owned a boa constrictor, Juliet, that was sick with lymphoma.

Right around that time, Juliet died, and Sanders, knowing Stenglein needed boa constrictor organs, put his pet of 20 years in the refrigerator and sent him an email.

The next day, the two men performed a necropsy, peeling back her skin and removing pieces of Juliet's organs, brain, and other tissue.

Stenglein prepped each sample, finely mincing the organs with a scalpel, putting them in petri dishes filled with a growth medium — and waited.

""Most of the organs I tried, all the cells died,"" he said. But Juliet's kidneys didn't die. In fact, the cells kept on growing, allowing Stenglein to grow more of the virus, and discover more of its secrets — which turned out to be a little bit scary.

Frightening family tree

Upon closer examination, it turns out the newfound virus has some dangerous relations. It looks like a mash-up of two different viruses that can jump from animals to humans, and cause diseases such as Lassa fever and Ebola. [10 Deadly Diseases That Hopped Across Species]

Although the newfound virus shares qualities of both, it most closely resembles an arenavirus. Until now, arenaviruses had been seen only in mammals — specifically, in rodents. And although the mice and rats that carry the arenaviruses are unaffected, they pass the virus on to humans through their urine or feces, causing diseases such as Lassa fever — a disease that kills some 5,000 people in West Africa each year, according to the World Health Organization — and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, among others.

Some of these diseases can pass from person to person, once the virus jumps from animal to human.

Despite the newfound virus's menacing cousins, Stenglein and DeRisi emphasized that snake owners have no reason to worry. There's no evidence that the snake virus can affect humans. The fact that it refused to grow in any cells but a boa constrictor's suggests there is a strong species barrier that protects humans.

Yet is it possible the virus could be passed to humans? ""The bottom line is, I don't know,"" DeRisi said. ""That is the fairest answer. I don't think it's that likely.""

""There's not a big epidemic of pet owners with crazy fevers and unexplained deaths. I think people would notice that,"" Stenglein said.

Next steps

The scientists still have work ahead: To confirm IBD as the cause of the snake sickness, they must still inject a healthy snake with the virus and show that IBD develops. That's a project in the works. DeRisi said next on his list is to see if snakes in the wild are affected by IBD.

In addition, it's still unknown how snakes get the disease in the first place. Mites that feed on snake blood have been linked to IBD, but DeRisi and Stenglein said it's very interesting that the newfound virus so closely resembles a virus known to lurk in mice and rats — favored snacks for snakes.

The discovery of the virus may lead to a fast diagnostic test for IBD, which would allow institutions to identify and kill any infected snakes before they pass on the disease.

Thanks to Juliet's kidney cells, which continue to grow, the lab can continue to replicate the virus, and continue the search for answers. (Juliet herself was given a dignified send-off. ""She's buried in the backyard,"" Sanders said.)

""There are a lot of evolutionary and genetic mysteries wrapped up in this research,"" DeRisi said. ""This may have opened the door to whole new world of arenaviruses and hemorrhagic fevers.""

Larry, the snake that started it all, apparently does not have IBD. He is, in fact, still alive, although Hook has had to put down two other pet snakes that got sick with IBD.

And although Larry still gets sick a lot, at 15 years old, ""he's a wonderful animal,"" Hook said. He's an integral part of the family, ""just like someone's dog or cat.""

IBD afflicts pythons and boa constrictors, causing a host of strange symptoms. The snakes tie themselves in knots, they projectile vomit and engage in an eerie behavior called stargazing; the snakes raise their heads over and over, stare into thin air, and sway drunkenly from side to side. [Image Gallery: Snakes of the World]

Biopsies from animals with the disease show their cells filled up with globules of proteins called inclusions, which may be responsible for the odd behaviors.

There's no cure for the disease. It moves swiftly in pythons, and can progress slowly in boa constrictors, but it is always fatal. And it's infectious, moving from snake to snake, though the mechanism of transmission isn't entirely clear. If one animal in a collection gets IBD, typically all the animals are euthanized.

Blood tests had suggested Larry, a Dumeril's boa constrictor, might have IBD. Wanting to know what could be done to save the beloved snake, Hook contacted Joseph DeRisi at the University of California, San Francisco, a virologist known for his work deciphering another mysterious virus, this one affecting macaws and parrots.

Her plea for help led DeRisi's lab to take on IBD. The scientists put out a call for samples of diseased and nondiseased snakes. Perhaps luckily, the Steinhart Aquarium at the California Academy of Sciences, just a few miles away, had a sudden outbreak of IBD.

Many snakes, both with and without IBD, had to be killed, providing the lab with plenty of freshly preserved tissue to start their investigation. [7 Shocking Snake Stories]

Postdoctoral researcher Mark Stenglein, the research's lead author, rifled through the genes of the dead snakes and soon had millions and millions of sequences. But to sort out which sequence might belong to any suspect viruses, he needed the ultimate genetic blueprint — the boa constrictor genome, which had never been put together.

Without the assembled genome, it would be extremely difficult to tell which sequences belonged to viruses that cause disease, and which were simply vestiges of viruses now rendered harmless by the rigors of time and evolution.

""They're the fossils of old infections,"" Stenglein said. ""They're in every genome. So if we saw those, they might have been confusing to us.""

Yet fate smiled upon the effort yet again. A contest called Assemblathon 2 — which pits different groups against each another in a kind of genome-off — was getting under way. They chose to take a stab at sequencing the red-tailed boa constrictor's genome, and Stenglein got his hands on the results.

Another wall

Yet to study a new virus, you must make more of it — which requires a host cell that will allow the virus to replicate itself. And here, Stenglein ran into yet another roadblock. He tried to grow the new virus in various animal cell lines — monkey cells, iguana cells, turtle cells, the cells of a viper — yet nothing worked. He needed a boa constrictor cell line. And since there was no existing boa constrictor cell line, he needed to start one himself.

""To do that, you need organs — tissue from the species,"" Stenglein said. ""And as you might imagine, you can't go buy boa constrictor kidneys at the supermarket.""

Kismet struck again, though this time the coincidence wasn't a happy one.

Chris Sanders, Larry's vet, owned a boa constrictor, Juliet, that was sick with lymphoma.

Right around that time, Juliet died, and Sanders, knowing Stenglein needed boa constrictor organs, put his pet of 20 years in the refrigerator and sent him an email.

The next day, the two men performed a necropsy, peeling back her skin and removing pieces of Juliet's organs, brain, and other tissue.

Stenglein prepped each sample, finely mincing the organs with a scalpel, putting them in petri dishes filled with a growth medium — and waited.

""Most of the organs I tried, all the cells died,"" he said. But Juliet's kidneys didn't die. In fact, the cells kept on growing, allowing Stenglein to grow more of the virus, and discover more of its secrets — which turned out to be a little bit scary.

Frightening family tree

Upon closer examination, it turns out the newfound virus has some dangerous relations. It looks like a mash-up of two different viruses that can jump from animals to humans, and cause diseases such as Lassa fever and Ebola. [10 Deadly Diseases That Hopped Across Species]

Although the newfound virus shares qualities of both, it most closely resembles an arenavirus. Until now, arenaviruses had been seen only in mammals — specifically, in rodents. And although the mice and rats that carry the arenaviruses are unaffected, they pass the virus on to humans through their urine or feces, causing diseases such as Lassa fever — a disease that kills some 5,000 people in West Africa each year, according to the World Health Organization — and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, among others.

Some of these diseases can pass from person to person, once the virus jumps from animal to human.

Despite the newfound virus's menacing cousins, Stenglein and DeRisi emphasized that snake owners have no reason to worry. There's no evidence that the snake virus can affect humans. The fact that it refused to grow in any cells but a boa constrictor's suggests there is a strong species barrier that protects humans.

Yet is it possible the virus could be passed to humans? ""The bottom line is, I don't know,"" DeRisi said. ""That is the fairest answer. I don't think it's that likely.""

""There's not a big epidemic of pet owners with crazy fevers and unexplained deaths. I think people would notice that,"" Stenglein said.

Next steps

The scientists still have work ahead: To confirm IBD as the cause of the snake sickness, they must still inject a healthy snake with the virus and show that IBD develops. That's a project in the works. DeRisi said next on his list is to see if snakes in the wild are affected by IBD.

In addition, it's still unknown how snakes get the disease in the first place. Mites that feed on snake blood have been linked to IBD, but DeRisi and Stenglein said it's very interesting that the newfound virus so closely resembles a virus known to lurk in mice and rats — favored snacks for snakes.

The discovery of the virus may lead to a fast diagnostic test for IBD, which would allow institutions to identify and kill any infected snakes before they pass on the disease.

Thanks to Juliet's kidney cells, which continue to grow, the lab can continue to replicate the virus, and continue the search for answers. (Juliet herself was given a dignified send-off. ""She's buried in the backyard,"" Sanders said.)

""There are a lot of evolutionary and genetic mysteries wrapped up in this research,"" DeRisi said. ""This may have opened the door to whole new world of arenaviruses and hemorrhagic fevers.""

Larry, the snake that started it all, apparently does not have IBD. He is, in fact, still alive, although Hook has had to put down two other pet snakes that got sick with IBD.

And although Larry still gets sick a lot, at 15 years old, ""he's a wonderful animal,"" Hook said. He's an integral part of the family, ""just like someone's dog or cat.""

10,"The waterways within and around the Iwokrama Forest are home to an extremely high diversity of fish. So far, 420 species have been identified and what makes this exceptional is that this figure is exceedingly high seeing as only a small portion of the rivers have been surveyed. This has led to estimates of up to 600 species for the area. In comparison, there are only 700 species of fish in all of North America. For an area its size it is possible that the Iwokrama forest has the world’s highest fish diversity.

Two factors potentially cause this elevated diversity. The first factor is the wide range of habitats represented within the area. Here, fish have a huge choice of habitats offering opportunities for speciation including flooded forests and savannahs, rivers, creeks, ponds and ox-bow lakes. The second factor is that the Essequibo River is situated between three major ichthyofaunal regions: the Orinoco, eastern Guiana Shield, and Amazon.

Flooding during the annual high water period enables an exchange in fish species between these three systems.

Fish highlights include the worlds largest freshwater fish, the Arapaima (Arapaima gigas), the Silver Arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), the common sport fish – Peacock Bass or Lukanani (Cichla ocellaris), the savage Red-Bellied Piranha (Pygo-centrus natteri), various freshwater stingrays, (Potamotrygon spp.), large catfish including the Piraíba or Lao Lao (Brachyplatystoma filamen-tosum), the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) as well as many colourful aquarium fish.

12,"What's the true cost of Department of Conservation budget cuts? Philip Matthews investigates.

All of a sudden, people are looking at the Department of Conservation (DOC) like it is one of those threatened species it was created to protect.

Advocacy group Forest and Bird set the agenda by declaring Thursday ""Love DOC day"". It urged you to bake a cake, send flowers, show you care, even tweet your support on social media. That might have sounded frivolous but there were very serious concerns behind the campaign. Last year, the Government slashed $54 million from DOC's budget. This year, a further $8.7m is to come out, with the loss of 140 jobs. These are jobs in field offices and on the environmental front line, not behind desks in Wellington, Nelson and Christchurch.

What could this restructure mean in practical terms? Dunedin student Kimberley Collins, a self- described ""nature nerd"", published a blog post titled ""Why the Sub-Antarctic Islands Need the Department of Conservation"". She describes work that is invisible to most. She writes that she fell in love with the Sub-Antarctics on a visit in 2010, and sees them as tiny life rafts for birds, seals and rare plants. ""Without DOC,"" she writes, ""these life rafts could sink.""

There is the Campbell Island teal, once assumed to be extinct. But it is back from the dead and DOC have removed every last rat from its island. There is the New Zealand sea lion, once prolific on New Zealand's southeast coast and now largely confined to the Auckland Islands. It was declared threatened in 1997; DOC is trying to manage its recovery. There are other rare, endemic and endangered species: the Auckland Island banded dotterel, the southern royal albatross, the Antipodes Island parakeet, the Bounty Island shag, the Snares crested penguin. Few of us will ever see these creatures in the wild. ""Without DOC they'd be gone,"" Collins writes. ""Forever - as in no bringing them back.""

In the current DOC structure, the Sub-Antarctics are managed by DOC's Southland Conservancy. In the proposed restructure, New Zealand's 11 conservancies will be reshaped into six regions. Southland will disappear into one larger region that also takes in Otago, Stewart Island and Canterbury. In the restructure, 12.2 DOC jobs will disappear from Southland, from a total of 127.4. Ten jobs are to go from the Te Anau office alone. Otago is to lose 20.9 jobs. Canterbury is to lose 15.2 jobs, although Christchurch will actually gain 6.5 jobs, while Geraldine, Twizel, Arthur's Pass and Rangiora all lose significant numbers. The Nelson Marlborough region loses 14.2 jobs, with the city of Nelson gaining jobs at the expense of Takaka, St Arnaud, Blenheim, Picton and other smaller offices. But the West Coast is the hardest hit region in the South Island, losing 24.6 jobs, or 18 per cent of DOC staff on the coast. Eight jobs go from Fox Glacier, 5.6 from Greymouth, three each from Westport and Franz Josef Glacier, two each from Haast and Punakaiki and one from Reefton, where an office of five becomes four.

These are just numbers on spreadsheets to some but they are also valuable jobs in small communities. Take Fox Glacier. Mike and Carrol Browne have lived there for close to 40 years. He is from Christchurch; she is Canadian. Now retired, they owned and managed Alpine Guides Fox Glacier. Mike Browne has also been on the New Zealand Conservation Authority and National Parks Board.

""For me personally, and the people I have talked to, it's an enormous blow,"" Carrol Brown says. ""Eight jobs is a lot in a town the size of ours.""

In the 2006 census, 375 people lived at Fox Glacier. ""The schools get a hit,"" she says. ""We're trying to keep a two-teacher school. They often have families. These little rural communities struggle. Some of the most active people in our community are DOC people.""

Eight jobs disappearing from Fox Glacier does not mean eight people are made redundant. As DOC director-general Al Morrison explained at a press conference last month, DOC has had a sinking lid policy as this restructure has been anticipated for at least a year. In the case of Fox Glacier, there are only eight people in an area office that is supposed to employ 15 people; under the proposal, only one will be axed. But that still matters. Mike Browne has heard that the proposed cut at Fox Glacier means that the office will no longer be manned for the public to ask about tracks, huts and conditions.

""That's a terrible move if they follow through with that,"" he says. Such advice is ""crucial"". Locally, the Copland Track is a popular attraction but there are a couple of creek crossings that can be extremely dangerous in a flood. ""We noticed that this summer when we had big floods in December. If there had not been DOC staff there to tell people not to go, we could have easily lost a life.""

He has the sense that DOC staff are feeling pretty low about these proposals, especially as they come so soon after last year's budget cut. ""I'm saddened by the way we seem to be constantly losing so much institutional knowledge from the outfit,"" he says. ""There have been some wonderful people who really know the area, know the environment, who have faded away over the years because they get sick of these constant restructurings.""

If money is the issue, he can think of better ways to go about it. ""An airport-type tax on people coming into the country would be much easier and people would not mind paying it if they knew that the money was going to maintain our national parks.""

But is money the issue? For Al Morrison, the answer seems to be both yes and no. At last month's press conference, Morrison said that the restructuring has not been driven by budget cuts. ""I want to be clear at the outset,"" he said forcefully. ""Even if the Government doubled our budget, we would be doing this restructuring."" Yes, the global financial crisis has forced everyone to do more with less, and the conservation budget has been nibbled at since 2009. In this case, around 3 per cent needed to be cut. But, he added, ""you do not put an organisation through major challenge and disruption if all you need to do is save 3 per cent on your budget"".

According to Morrison, the current DOC disruption has been years in the planning. In the 2012 DOC annual report, Morrison went back through recent history. He wrote that in 2000, the Helen Clark government gave DOC extra funding to implement the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy. Five years later, an independent review showed that ""money was being well spent and, where conservation work was done, it was very successful"". But the decline of species was not halted.

This was an expression of how big the task was rather than an indictment of DOC's work. How to halt that species decline? Pest control is the answer. But how much more did DOC need to spend? ""We stopped counting when we were well over the size of the national health budget and realised we had to find another way,"" Morrison wrote.

The other way is the partnership model unveiled last month - ""The idea that we need to get really serious about working with business, local government, iwi and private landowners and to build on our strength in conservation with communities."" In a version of outsourcing, DOC now intends to ""grow the conservation business by engaging others in it"". Morrison reminds us that conservation ""is a New Zealand issue for all New Zealanders"".

That sounds reasonable. But what does it mean in practice? For Green Party conservation spokeswoman and former Environment Canterbury councillor Eugenie Sage, there are two main issues in the restructure. First, there is taking people out of area offices and field centres, but there is also ""a major reshaping of the way the department does its work"", including enlarging the commercial business unit that chases sponsorship and commercial opportunities. Or, as Morrison put it, one arm of DOC does the field work and the other arm ""grows"" the field work. Sage says that this means ""we are seeing a department that will depend on corporate welfare with all the problems that involves"".

The change in thinking at DOC was outlined in the briefing to incoming Conservation Minister Nick Smith at the start of this year. Quite a bit has happened since he was last in the role. Smith was told that DOC has established a commercial business unit ""to increase revenue while delivering strategic partnerships and appropriate business opportunities on public conservation land"".

The business sector ""has considerable potential to contribute directly to conservation work, and for businesses to realise actual bene?ts from these partnerships"".

Air New Zealand and Genesis Energy were named as high-profile examples. The ministerial briefing said that DOC's strategic thinking has actively shifted from ""allowing"" commercial activity on public conservation land to ""enabling"" it. It said that in June 2012, ""the Ministers of Tourism, Conservation and Economic Development directed the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Department of Conservation to identify options for realising greater value from international visitors' use of public conservation lands and waters, while also seeking to improve conservation outcomes"". This report was due to come back to the three ministers in question - Nick Smith, John Key and Steven Joyce - at the end of January, 2013. It was ""likely to propose changes to conservation legislation, policies and systems"".

""Extraction of value means commercial development,"" Sage says. ""Where can more mines go? Where can we put some wind turbines? Where can we put some big tourism developments? That sort of thing.""

""I don't have a problem with commercial partnerships but there are certainly risks,"" Mike Browne says from Fox Glacier. ""I'm not that convinced that there is a vast pool of money out there. And people don't give money for nothing."" Aside from the tricky ethics of marrying commercial imperatives and environmental care, critics see other behind-the- scenes problems in the restructure. The two arms report to different parts of the organisation, located in different places. A ""services arm"" person could report to a manager in the same office, whereas a ""partnership arm"" person reports to someone hundreds of kilometres away in Nelson, Wellington or Christchurch. That risks creating a silo mentality, and the integration of the current DOC structure, based around place, could be lost. Sage says that the current reporting line was deliberately established after the 1995 Cave Creek tragedy to make it clear who was responsible for decisions. ""It seems to be a real mish-mash of lines of accountability,"" Mike Browne says. ""It seems potentially a risky thing to do to break it up so much.""

When Browne hears talk of ""partnerships"", he thinks that there is one important partnership which seems to be overlooked. That is the partnership between DOC and the public, through conservation boards.

""Nick Smith says he wants to cut down the number of conservation boards,"" Browne says. ""Al Morrison is not at all keen on conservation management plans, which is the way the public actually has some say over what happens in the management of what is our land. That's the way it's been set up and if it's allowed to work, it works pretty well for people in the communities to have their say on the broad policy and sometimes the detail.""

The new DOC thinking is to encourage more volunteers from the general public, but to help at ground level rather than having a voice at the strategic or management level.

""There seems to be a desire to cut back on the amount of input, by making the conservancies bigger and cutting back on conservation boards.""",The true cost of DOC budget cuts,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuc3R1ZmYuY28ubnovdGhlLXByZXNzLzg1NDYwMDgvVGhlLXRydWUtY29zdC1vZi1ET0MtYnVkZ2V0LWN1dHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static2.stuff.co.nz/1366771822/184/8547184.jpg,2013-04-13,"{'sent': ""What's the true cost of Department of Conservation budget cuts?"", 'ents': {'ORG': ['Department of Conservation']}}","What's the true cost of Department of Conservation budget cuts?

In the 2006 census, 375 people lived at Fox Glacier. ""The schools get a hit,"" she says. ""We're trying to keep a two-teacher school. They often have families. These little rural communities struggle. Some of the most active people in our community are DOC people.""

Eight jobs disappearing from Fox Glacier does not mean eight people are made redundant. As DOC director-general Al Morrison explained at a press conference last month, DOC has had a sinking lid policy as this restructure has been anticipated for at least a year. In the case of Fox Glacier, there are only eight people in an area office that is supposed to employ 15 people; under the proposal, only one will be axed. But that still matters. Mike Browne has heard that the proposed cut at Fox Glacier means that the office will no longer be manned for the public to ask about tracks, huts and conditions.

""That's a terrible move if they follow through with that,"" he says. Such advice is ""crucial"". Locally, the Copland Track is a popular attraction but there are a couple of creek crossings that can be extremely dangerous in a flood. ""We noticed that this summer when we had big floods in December. If there had not been DOC staff there to tell people not to go, we could have easily lost a life.""

He has the sense that DOC staff are feeling pretty low about these proposals, especially as they come so soon after last year's budget cut. ""I'm saddened by the way we seem to be constantly losing so much institutional knowledge from the outfit,"" he says. ""There have been some wonderful people who really know the area, know the environment, who have faded away over the years because they get sick of these constant restructurings.""

If money is the issue, he can think of better ways to go about it. ""An airport-type tax on people coming into the country would be much easier and people would not mind paying it if they knew that the money was going to maintain our national parks.""

But is money the issue? For Al Morrison, the answer seems to be both yes and no. At last month's press conference, Morrison said that the restructuring has not been driven by budget cuts. ""I want to be clear at the outset,"" he said forcefully. ""Even if the Government doubled our budget, we would be doing this restructuring."" Yes, the global financial crisis has forced everyone to do more with less, and the conservation budget has been nibbled at since 2009. In this case, around 3 per cent needed to be cut. But, he added, ""you do not put an organisation through major challenge and disruption if all you need to do is save 3 per cent on your budget"".

According to Morrison, the current DOC disruption has been years in the planning. In the 2012 DOC annual report, Morrison went back through recent history. He wrote that in 2000, the Helen Clark government gave DOC extra funding to implement the New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy. Five years later, an independent review showed that ""money was being well spent and, where conservation work was done, it was very successful"". But the decline of species was not halted.

This was an expression of how big the task was rather than an indictment of DOC's work. How to halt that species decline? Pest control is the answer. But how much more did DOC need to spend? ""We stopped counting when we were well over the size of the national health budget and realised we had to find another way,"" Morrison wrote.

The other way is the partnership model unveiled last month - ""The idea that we need to get really serious about working with business, local government, iwi and private landowners and to build on our strength in conservation with communities."" In a version of outsourcing, DOC now intends to ""grow the conservation business by engaging others in it"". Morrison reminds us that conservation ""is a New Zealand issue for all New Zealanders"".

That sounds reasonable. But what does it mean in practice? For Green Party conservation spokeswoman and former Environment Canterbury councillor Eugenie Sage, there are two main issues in the restructure. First, there is taking people out of area offices and field centres, but there is also ""a major reshaping of the way the department does its work"", including enlarging the commercial business unit that chases sponsorship and commercial opportunities. Or, as Morrison put it, one arm of DOC does the field work and the other arm ""grows"" the field work. Sage says that this means ""we are seeing a department that will depend on corporate welfare with all the problems that involves"".

The change in thinking at DOC was outlined in the briefing to incoming Conservation Minister Nick Smith at the start of this year. Quite a bit has happened since he was last in the role. Smith was told that DOC has established a commercial business unit ""to increase revenue while delivering strategic partnerships and appropriate business opportunities on public conservation land"".

The business sector ""has considerable potential to contribute directly to conservation work, and for businesses to realise actual bene?ts from these partnerships"".

Air New Zealand and Genesis Energy were named as high-profile examples. The ministerial briefing said that DOC's strategic thinking has actively shifted from ""allowing"" commercial activity on public conservation land to ""enabling"" it. It said that in June 2012, ""the Ministers of Tourism, Conservation and Economic Development directed the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and the Department of Conservation to identify options for realising greater value from international visitors' use of public conservation lands and waters, while also seeking to improve conservation outcomes"". This report was due to come back to the three ministers in question - Nick Smith, John Key and Steven Joyce - at the end of January, 2013. It was ""likely to propose changes to conservation legislation, policies and systems"".

""Extraction of value means commercial development,"" Sage says. ""Where can more mines go? Where can we put some wind turbines? Where can we put some big tourism developments? That sort of thing.""

""I don't have a problem with commercial partnerships but there are certainly risks,"" Mike Browne says from Fox Glacier. ""I'm not that convinced that there is a vast pool of money out there. And people don't give money for nothing."" Aside from the tricky ethics of marrying commercial imperatives and environmental care, critics see other behind-the- scenes problems in the restructure. The two arms report to different parts of the organisation, located in different places. A ""services arm"" person could report to a manager in the same office, whereas a ""partnership arm"" person reports to someone hundreds of kilometres away in Nelson, Wellington or Christchurch. That risks creating a silo mentality, and the integration of the current DOC structure, based around place, could be lost. Sage says that the current reporting line was deliberately established after the 1995 Cave Creek tragedy to make it clear who was responsible for decisions. ""It seems to be a real mish-mash of lines of accountability,"" Mike Browne says. ""It seems potentially a risky thing to do to break it up so much.""

When Browne hears talk of ""partnerships"", he thinks that there is one important partnership which seems to be overlooked. That is the partnership between DOC and the public, through conservation boards.

""Nick Smith says he wants to cut down the number of conservation boards,"" Browne says. ""Al Morrison is not at all keen on conservation management plans, which is the way the public actually has some say over what happens in the management of what is our land. That's the way it's been set up and if it's allowed to work, it works pretty well for people in the communities to have their say on the broad policy and sometimes the detail.""

The new DOC thinking is to encourage more volunteers from the general public, but to help at ground level rather than having a voice at the strategic or management level.

""There seems to be a desire to cut back on the amount of input, by making the conservancies bigger and cutting back on conservation boards.""",POLICY
13,"South Georgia Island, a lonely British Antarctic territory in the far South Atlantic, has a rat problem.

Since the furry stowaways landed here aboard sealing and whaling ships in the 19th century, they've been wreaking ecological havoc on the island and its ground-nesting seabirds by preying on the birds and their eggs.

Enter an international team of wildlife biologists, who have recently completed the second phase of history's largest rat-eradication program on the remote island.

Braving appalling weather in the run-up to the Antarctic winter, the group's helicopter pilots logged hundreds of hours in perilous flying conditions to spread nearly 200 tons of rat poison over 224 square miles (580 square kilometers) of South Georgia's coastline.

The ultimate goal: To rid this once supreme seabird habitat of its millions of rats once and for all. South Georgia was probably the richest seabird-breeding area in the world when British Captain James Cook visited it in 1775, according to Tony Martin of the University of Dundee, who leads the rat-eradication campaign on behalf of the South Georgia Heritage Trust. (See more pictures of South Georgia.)

Now the island has less than one percent of its original seabird population, he said. ""And that is down to rats. This is a human-induced problem, and it is down to humans to do something about it.""

And they are. This recent bait drop follows a successful trial two years ago, which cleared 10 percent of South Georgia of the invasive rodents. Next year, Martin said, the group plans to return and finish the job, hopefully rendering South Georgia rat-free by 2015.

""This is ten times bigger than anything that has ever been attempted anywhere else,"" Martin said.

Oh, Rats: Getting Rid of Rodents

South Georgia's ambitious rat-eradication campaign may be the world's biggest at the moment, but it's far from the only one. (Watch a video of rats at night.)

Many of the world's most biologically important island ecosystems have been invaded by rats. Many seabirds nest, breed, and raise their young on islands because they've been historically safe from predators—until rats came along.

What's more, while islands may represent only 5 percent of the world's land mass, they account for half of all the world's endangered species.

As of last count 435 islands around the world have been cleared of rats, according to Island Conservation, an organization that works to remove invasive species on islands. It's a number that is growing quickly, and so is the success rate.

The projects try their best not to hurt the species they're supposed to protect.

For one, the rat poison, brodifacoum, is not water soluble, so it can't leach into the groundwater or poison waterways.

Some seabird scavengers could eat stricken rats and become ill, though the rat carcasses are hard to find: The poison makes the rats photophobic, or shy of light, so the rodents usually retreat to their burrows before dying.

It's possible that a few duck or other birds may ingest the poisonous pellets, but since rats eat thousands and possibly millions of chicks a year overall, poison is still the better strategy, experts say.

""This is a war that is being won island by island,"" said Brad Keitt, the group's director of conservation. (Also see ""Giant Killer Mice Decimating Rare Seabirds."")

Even so, ""each island, of course, brings with it its own challenges,"" said veteran helicopter pilot Peter Garden, a New Zealander who worked on rat-eradication projects in Campbell Island, South Georgia, the Seychelles, the South Pacific, Alaska, and the Caribbean.

""South Georgia was especially tough,"" he said. ""Its remote location in the South Atlantic made it a huge logistical challenge, and ... it receives some ferocious weather.

""The fact that it is also the largest breeding area in the South Atlantic for seabirds means that there are always lots of large birds sharing the airspace, and this creates quite a hazard for us. We are operating around 150 feet [46 meters] above the ground, where a lot of bird activity occurs.""

Here are some islands that are aggressively ridding their homes of rats.

New Zealanders lead the field when it comes to getting rid of rats, according to Martin.

""They began focusing on rat eradication on their own islands back in the 1980s in order to try to preserve their native wildlife. Over the years they've had a lot of successes, developed a huge amount of expertise, and in the 1990s began perfecting the science of using helicopters to make aerial bait drops over large areas."" (Also see ""Drug-filled Mice Airdropped Over Guam to Kill Snakes."")

New Zealand's successful campaign to remove nearly a quarter of a million brown rats from Campbell Island—a 44-square-mile (114-square-kilometer) sub-Antarctic island—was the world's largest rat-eradication project when it was completed in 2001. Twelve years later the island is rat-free and the once critically endangered Campbell Island teal—a duck that fell victim to the rats—has bounced back. (See seabird pictures.)

Sophisticated poison-dispersal techniques using GPS guidance and specially designed spreader buckets slung under the helicopters were developed for the Campbell Island operation, and went on to pave the way for the much larger one on South Georgia.

Lord Howe Island, Australia

A U.S. $9 million program to eradicate an estimated 130,000 rats on the island, a subtropical paradise located 370 miles (595 kilometers) off Australia's eastern coast, was launched in July 2012.

Rats originally arrived aboard the S.S. Makambo, which ran aground on the north end of the island in June 1918. It was a catastrophe—at least 30 species of wildlife have since disappeared completely from the island, while another 13 species remain under threat. Lord Howe Island has often been cited as a worst-case example of rat devastation.

Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia

Sometimes described as the Galápagos of the north, the chain of islands in British Columbia has some of the largest remaining seabird colonies in Canada.

At one time these seabirds could be counted in the hundreds of thousands, but three centuries of rat infestation have whittled their numbers down to 20,000 or so.

Last September a rat-eradication program was launched, and so far two of the islands have been cleared of rats.

The call came in to SoCal Parrot’s 24-hour emergency hotline just before the July Fourth weekend. A wild parrot had built her nest in the attic of a Point Loma home. The owner wanted the raucous nestlings gone before her holiday party; she had called an exterminator, but preferred to have the removal by a rescue group.

The four squawking babies were trapped in insulation. By the time rescue founder Brooke Durham crawled into the attic, one had died and the survivors were in distress. She whisked them away to recover and mature at SoCal Parrot’s sanctuary in Jamul.

“We’re not afraid to drive a distance to save a wild injured parrot,” Durham explained.

Durham, a metal artist and licensed wildlife rehabilitator, began working with wild parrots about eight years ago, while volunteering with Project Wildlife. She discovered that no organization in the region focused on the plight or protection of injured wild parrots.

These ultra-social birds, endangered in their native countries, lack legal protections in the U.S. as naturalized nonnative species. She founded the nonprofit SoCal Parrot to rescue and rehabilitate injured wild parrots and return them to the wild if possible.

Primarily Amazons and conures, these parrots are descended from escaped wild-caught imported parrots, not captive-born or released pets. They breed and form flocks in urban areas with mild climates.

SoCal Parrot’s staff and volunteers nurse injured birds back to health and introduce them into their aviary’s foster flock of 50 to 60 parrots.

“Many babies we receive are put in with the wild birds, who teach them (survival skills) to be wild,” Durham said. “Once they join the wild flock, it takes about a month before they see us as enemies. We isolate them from humans.”

“Most will be released as a flock into the wild,” explained Development and Education Director Amanda Plante, who manages wild parrot education programs.

15,"Even ten years ago it would have been impossible to imagine: clear-as-day footage of a jaguar plodding through the impenetrable Amazon, or a bicolored-spined porcupine balancing on a branch, or a troop of spider monkeys feeding at a clay lick, or a band of little coatis racing one-by-one from the dense foliage. These are things that even researchers who have spent a lifetime in the Amazon may never see. Now anyone can: scientists at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Ecuador’s Yasuní National Park have recently begun using camera trap videos to take movies of animals few will ever view in their lifetimes. The videos—following years of photo camera trapping—provide an intimate view of a world increasingly threatened by the oil industry.

“We started with video around 18 months ago and in that period we have been able to record more than 20 species, including top predators like jaguars and pumas,” Diego Mosquera, head of the camera trap program and manager of Tiputini Biodiversity Station which is run by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, told mongabay.com. “Certainly, there is still so much to discover.”

The program at Tiputini has been going on for eight years, but for the first six the team focused solely on photographs (55,000 to date). And although Tiputini only covers 6.5 square kilometers—less than one-tenth of a percent of the park’s total—they managed to record over 60 species, including 35 mammals and 27 birds. Mosquera says highlights to the program include panthers, feeding pumas, short-eared dogs and other extremely rare species.

Camera trap video compilation from Tiputini Biodiversity Station.

“We were very happy and surprised to have pictures of a black panther, which is basically a black jaguar. Considering that only around 6 percent of jaguars (Panthera onca) are melanistic, having a picture of a black jaguar is really amazing.”

The team has also taken rare photos of a puma (Puma concolor) eating a deer.

“This was extremely interesting not only because of the picture but also in terms of the information that it provide us,” says Mosquera. In addition to eating, the team also has footage of pumas defecating. But that wasn’t the end of intriguing behavior captured on film.

“We were also very surprised to notice that for some reason peccaries are consistently aware that there is a camera ‘watching’ them. This, unfortunately, leads in many cases to ‘friendly attacks,'” says Mosquera.

The program, which includes John Blake from the University of Florida who aids with data analysis, has also recorded mammals that science knows almost nothing about.

“Most animals are elusive, but I think that, at least in Tiputini, the two species of wild canids are some of the rarest animals in the rainforest. The short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis) and the bush dog (Speothus venaticus) are extremely elusive and hard to see, even having an ‘eye’ on the forest 24 hours a day with the cameras,” notes Mosquera.

In fact, out of 55,000 photos the program has only managed to take three pictures of bush dogs—or one in over 18,000.

“We need to obtai more information on [short-eared dogs and bush dogs] to understand them better and ultimately have better arguments to protect them,” says Mosquera. But even with all they’ve recorded, Mosquera says there is much more to discover, including species that have yet to show up on camera such as Neotropical river otter (Lontra longicaudis), the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), the grison (Galictis vitatta) and the Amazon weasel (Mustela africana).

“These days many people have lost connection with nature and these images and videos can bring them closer to the magnificent creatures we share our planet with, waking up their curiosity, encouraging them to see wildlife ‘live’ and more importantly, encouraging them to protecting it,” Mosquera says.

While scientists use camera traps for much-improved monitoring of wildlife, Tiputini’s program is especially vital because it provides an inside look at what experts say is probably the most biodiverse place on the planet.

Currently, Yasuní National Park—which is larger than Cyprus—is a world record holder for a number of species groups: 153 amphibian species, over 100 bats, 597 birds, and 3,135 vascular plants. A single hectare in Yasuní contains around 655 tree species–more trees than are found in the U.S. and Canada combined. Even more astounding, scientists have estimated that one hectare in Yasuní may contain more than 100,000 arthropod species. If this is so, it would be the highest number of species per unit found anywhere in the world.

“The Amazon is so complex that even though we know so much, the truth is that we don’t know anything,” says Mosquera. “Unfortunately, it seems that destruction is occurring so fast that we might not have time to see the impacts that these activities have on the wildlife and might lose species we didn’t even have time to ‘discover’.”

In fact, each of Yasuní’s innumerable species—and in aggregation, the world’s biggest bloom of life—may be imperiled by oil production. Ecuador currently prohibits oil companies in protected areas. However, there’s a loophole: if the oil exploitation is deemed in Ecuador’s “national interest” then operations may drill in parks and other protected areas. In fact, the oil industry is currently working just 20 kilometers from Tiputini Biodiversity Station.

“But, we just found out that a new road extension is going on to enable access to a smaller [oil] facility and this is just 5 kilometers from us,” says Mosquera. “This is obviously very scary.”

And oil exploitation is set to expand: the park recently made news around the world when an innovative initiative to keep oil out of the park’s most remote sections collapsed. The Yasuní-ITT Initiative would have kept the ITT blocs of Yasuní (Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini) off-limits to oil exploration, if donors and the international community agreed to pay 50 percent of the forgone revenue for the untapped oil fields: amounting to $3.6 billion. The idea was to preserve biodiversity, curb climate change (by keeping fossil fuels in the ground), and safeguard indigenous populations. The funds paid to Ecuador would have gone to a trust fund managed by the UN Development Program and supported a variety of projects including reforestation, renewable energy, and various community initiatives. However, the funds failed to materialize quickly enough for the Ecuadorean government (around $330 million was pledged) and in August, Ecuador’s president Rafael Correa announced he was canceling the program and opening up ITT to oil exploitation.

“Oil operations have obvious and immediate impacts (roads, people, pipelines, noise, pollution) but the long term impacts are a huge concern,” Mosquera says. “With roads built, not only the habitat of many species is fragmented avoiding the normal gene flow, but colonization and everything that comes with it is encouraged (deforestation, illegal logging, expansion of the agricultural frontier, overhunting and traffic of wildlife, acculturation of indigenous people, etc.).”

According to him, oil operations in northern Ecuadorean Amazon have already led to an “almost complete destruction of the area.”

“This could also be the fate of Yasuní, based on what we have seen so far already happening,” Mosquera warns.

In early October, the Ecuadorean congress approved expanding oil drilling in the park, following Correa’s lead. Correa has said operations will start as soon as possible. Still, there may be one final way to keep oil companies out of the remote ITT blocs: a national referendum. If those opposed to drilling in Yasuní can gather signatures from 5 percent of the country’s population (around 680,000 people) than the decision to open Yasuní to oil exploitation would end up in a national referendum. Opinion polls in Ecuador have shown overwhelming support for the Yasuní-ITT Initiative, which could result in those same citizens voting to preserve the park.

“[ Yasuní’s] diversity is the key to our future and has an enormous value that we can’t even calculate, not only in terms of species or genetic resources, but also in terms of ecological processes,” says Mosquera. “Yasuní is a place that has not changed much in the last few millennia and this fact help us understand how the ecosystem works when it doesn’t have human impacts.”

Mosquera believes that the final importance of Tiputini’s camera trap program may not be for science, but for raising public awareness and concern for the wondrous, but rarely-seen wildlife of the deepest Amazon.

“Perhaps the more important part of this technology is that it has an enormous power to educate people at all levels,” he says, adding that, “Yasuní is a treasure not only for Ecuador, but for the whole world.”

Now, the whole world can experience this hidden forest and its shadowy, but very real and very imperiled, inhabitants.

Over 100 scientists warn Ecuadorian Congress against oil development in Yasuni

(10/03/2013) Over 100 scientists have issued a statement to the Ecuadorian Congress warning that proposed oil development and accompanying roads in Yasuni National Park will degrade its “extraordinary biodiversity.” The statement by a group dubbed the Scientists Concerned for Yasuni outlines in detail how the park is not only likely the most biodiverse ecosystems in the western hemisphere, but in the entire world. Despite this, the Ecuadorian government has recently given the go-ahead to plans to drill for oil in Yasuni’s Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) blocs, one of most remote areas in the Amazon rainforest.

The case against Ecuador’s claims of ‘low-impact drilling’ in Yasuní

(09/16/2013) Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa recently announced to the world that he was ending the 6-year initiative aimed at avoiding oil drilling in a critical piece of the Amazon, the ITT Block of Yasuní National Park. In the speech, and the accompanying Decree, the President emphasized that the exploitation will affect less than 1% of the park. In subsequent remarks, President Correa indicated that the impacted area would be less than 0.001%. Thus, the new government pitch: minimum impact, maximum reward. Here, we counter that impacts related to biodiversity, indigenous people in voluntary isolation, and climate change may be severe.

Deforestation surges as Ecuador kills Amazon protection plan

(09/04/2013) Data released this week by Terra-i, a collaborative mapping initiative, shows that deforestation in Ecuador for the first three months of 2013 was pacing more than 300 percent ahead of last year’s rate. The report comes shortly after Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa killed off a proposed plan to prohibit oil drilling in Yasuni National Park in exchange for payments equivalent to half the value of the park’s unexploited oil.

Yasuni could still be spared oil drilling

(08/26/2013) When Ecuadorean President, Rafael Correa, announced on August 15th that he was abandoning an innovative program to spare three blocs of Yasuni National Park from oil drilling, it seemed like the world had tossed away its most biodiverse ecosystem. However, environmental groups and activists quickly responded that there may be another way to keep oil companies out of Yasuni’s Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) blocs: a national referendum.

11,000 barrels of oil spill into the Coca River in the Amazon

(06/12/2013) On May 31st, a landslide ruptured an oil pipeline in Ecuadorean Amazon, sending around 11,000 barrels of oil ( 420,000 gallons) into the Coca River. The oil pollution has since moved into the larger Napo River, which borders Yasuni National Park, and is currently heading downstream into Peru and Brazil. The spill has occurred in a region that is notorious for heavy oil production and decades of contamination, in addition to resistance and lawsuits by indigenous groups.

Is it possible to reduce the impact of oil drilling in the Amazon rainforest?

(05/02/2013) Oil extraction in the Amazon rainforest has been linked to severe environmental degradation — including deforestation and pollution — which in some areas has spurred violent social conflict. Yet a vast extent of the Colombian, Peruvian, Ecuadorian, Bolivian, and Brazilian Amazon is currently under concession for oil and gas exploration and production. It seems clear that much of this hydrocarbon development is going to proceed whether environmentalists and human rights groups like it or not.

Want to stop climate change: buy fossil fuel deposits

(06/07/2012) Governments, NGOs, and others fighting climate change should consider buying coal and oil deposits—not to exploit them, but to keep them from being exploited, according to a bold new policy paper in the Journal of Political Economy. Economist Bard Harstad with the Kellogg School of Management argues that climate coalitions could quickly slash carbon emissions by purchasing and conserving marginal fossil fuel deposits, a strategy that would solve the current problem of carbon leakage, i.e. when cutting emissions in one place pushes others to burn more elsewhere. Given that carbon emissions rose to a new record last year—31.6 gigatons—and carbon has hit 400 parts per million (ppm) in the atmosphere for the first time in at least 800,000 years, Harstad’s analysis comes at a time when scientists are warning that urgent and bold action is needed to mitigate global climate change before it becomes irreversible.

Pictures of Yasuni, Ecuador’s rainforest gem

(04/27/2012) In late 2010, mongabay.com reporter Jeremy Hance traveled to Yasuni National Park, arguably the most biodiverse place on the planet and home to a unique initiative to save a rainforest by asking the international community to pay to keep oil in the ground. Researchers have found more tree species in a single hectare in Yasuni National Park than in all of the U.S. and Canada combined. Yasuni also contains the highest biodiversity of reptiles and amphibians in the world with 271 species. But insects trump them all: entomologist Terry Erwin has estimated that a single hectare of rainforest in Yasuni may contain as many as 100,000 unique insect species.",Could camera trap videos galvanize the world to protect Yasuni from oil drilling?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS9jb3VsZC1jYW1lcmEtdHJhcC12aWRlb3MtZ2FsdmFuaXplLXRoZS13b3JsZC10by1wcm90ZWN0LXlhc3VuaS1mcm9tLW9pbC1kcmlsbGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.mongabay.com/wp-content/themes/mongabay_v1/img/icons/favicon.png,2013-11-07,"{'sent': 'Even ten years ago it would have been impossible to imagine: clear-as-day footage of a jaguar plodding through the impenetrable Amazon, or a bicolored-spined porcupine balancing on a branch, or a troop of spider monkeys feeding at a clay lick, or a band of little coatis racing one-by-one from the dense foliage.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Amazon'], 'CARDINAL': ['one']}}","Even ten years ago it would have been impossible to imagine: clear-as-day footage of a jaguar plodding through the impenetrable Amazon, or a bicolored-spined porcupine balancing on a branch, or a troop of spider monkeys feeding at a clay lick, or a band of little coatis racing one-by-one from the dense foliage. These are things that even researchers who have spent a lifetime in the Amazon may never see. Now anyone can: scientists at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in Ecuador’s Yasuní National Park have recently begun using camera trap videos to take movies of animals few will ever view in their lifetimes. The videos—following years of photo camera trapping—provide an intimate view of a world increasingly threatened by the oil industry.

“We started with video around 18 months ago and in that period we have been able to record more than 20 species, including top predators like jaguars and pumas,” Diego Mosquera, head of the camera trap program and manager of Tiputini Biodiversity Station which is run by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito, told mongabay.com. “Certainly, there is still so much to discover.”

The program at Tiputini has been going on for eight years, but for the first six the team focused solely on photographs (55,000 to date). And although Tiputini only covers 6.5 square kilometers—less than one-tenth of a percent of the park’s total—they managed to record over 60 species, including 35 mammals and 27 birds. Mosquera says highlights to the program include panthers, feeding pumas, short-eared dogs and other extremely rare species.

“We were very happy and surprised to have pictures of a black panther, which is basically a black jaguar. Considering that only around 6 percent of jaguars (Panthera onca) are melanistic, having a picture of a black jaguar is really amazing.”

The team has also taken rare photos of a puma (Puma concolor) eating a deer.

“This was extremely interesting not only because of the picture but also in terms of the information that it provide us,” says Mosquera. In addition to eating, the team also has footage of pumas defecating. But that wasn’t the end of intriguing behavior captured on film.

“We were also very surprised to notice that for some reason peccaries are consistently aware that there is a camera ‘watching’ them. This, unfortunately, leads in many cases to ‘friendly attacks,'” says Mosquera.

The program, which includes John Blake from the University of Florida who aids with data analysis, has also recorded mammals that science knows almost nothing about.

“Most animals are elusive, but I think that, at least in Tiputini, the two species of wild canids are some of the rarest animals in the rainforest. The short-eared dog (Atelocynus microtis) and the bush dog (Speothus venaticus) are extremely elusive and hard to see, even having an ‘eye’ on the forest 24 hours a day with the cameras,” notes Mosquera.

In fact, out of 55,000 photos the program has only managed to take three pictures of bush dogs—or one in over 18,000.

“We need to obtai more information on [short-eared dogs and bush dogs] to understand them better and ultimately have better arguments to protect them,” says Mosquera. But even with all they’ve recorded, Mosquera says there is much more to discover, including species that have yet to show up on camera such as Neotropical river otter (Lontra longicaudis), the giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis), the grison (Galictis vitatta) and the Amazon weasel (Mustela africana).

“These days many people have lost connection with nature and these images and videos can bring them closer to the magnificent creatures we share our planet with, waking up their curiosity, encouraging them to see wildlife ‘live’ and more importantly, encouraging them to protecting it,” Mosquera says.

While scientists use camera traps for much-improved monitoring of wildlife, Tiputini’s program is especially vital because it provides an inside look at what experts say is probably the most biodiverse place on the planet.

Currently, Yasuní National Park—which is larger than Cyprus—is a world record holder for a number of species groups: 153 amphibian species, over 100 bats, 597 birds, and 3,135 vascular plants. A single hectare in Yasuní contains around 655 tree species–more trees than are found in the U.S. and Canada combined. Even more astounding, scientists have estimated that one hectare in Yasuní may contain more than 100,000 arthropod species. If this is so, it would be the highest number of species per unit found anywhere in the world.

“The Amazon is so complex that even though we know so much, the truth is that we don’t know anything,” says Mosquera. “Unfortunately, it seems that destruction is occurring so fast that we might not have time to see the impacts that these activities have on the wildlife and might lose species we didn’t even have time to ‘discover’.”

In fact, each of Yasuní’s innumerable species—and in aggregation, the world’s biggest bloom of life—may be imperiled by oil production. Ecuador currently prohibits oil companies in protected areas. However, there’s a loophole: if the oil exploitation is deemed in Ecuador’s “national interest” then operations may drill in parks and other protected areas. In fact, the oil industry is currently working just 20 kilometers from Tiputini Biodiversity Station.

“But, we just found out that a new road extension is going on to enable access to a smaller [oil] facility and this is just 5 kilometers from us,” says Mosquera. “This is obviously very scary.”

And oil exploitation is set to expand: the park recently made news around the world when an innovative initiative to keep oil out of the park’s most remote sections collapsed. The Yasuní-ITT Initiative would have kept the ITT blocs of Yasuní (Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini) off-limits to oil exploration, if donors and the international community agreed to pay 50 percent of the forgone revenue for the untapped oil fields: amounting to $3.6 billion.

16,"Elephant tusk, lion skulls, pinned butterflies and bodybuilding supplements: The disturbing rise in illegal items confiscated by Britain's border force



Home Office has revealed more items were confiscated between April 2012 and April 2013 than in any other year.

Last year, 80.7kg (178lb) of endangered elephant tusk was confiscated by border agents at Heathrow - worth tens of thousands on the black market - compared to just 3.3kg (7.2lb) in 2010

Illegal trade of ivory is growing globally, with an estimated 17,000 elephants poached in 2011 alone

Nearly four tonnes of health and slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year

Rhino horns, tortoises and big cats, pinned butterflies and boxes of Detonate bodybuilding supplements - these are just some of the items being smuggled into Britain, according to border officials.

The Home Office has revealed that more items were confiscated between April 2012 and April 2013 than in any other year.



Other contraband included £4,000 shawls made of Tibetan antelope wool and books bound in elephant hide.



Grant Miller, the senior officer on the Border Force team, said: 'We have everything from rhino horn to ivory to the taxidermy items and marine species that we see being brought back into the UK, both in passengers' luggage - but more importantly, and in large quantities, through freight.'

In total, more than 2.5 million illegal items were seized last year - worth tens of millions - compared to 250,000 in 2011

Items are confiscated at the border under the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES).



The 2012/13 year saw 690 items seized - up from 509 the previous year - and included 3,890kg of medicine containing extracts of endangered species, 326 ivory items and 93 live animals.



In the climate-controlled warehouse, shelves overflow with items waiting for CITES experts to see if they fall under the treaty.



Jan Sowa, who works with the CITES team, said: 'I'm not surprised by anything any more.'

One piece of ivory taken from a baby elephant was painted black to disguise it as a wooden artifact, while 12 bangles were wrapped in raffia.

Taxidermied turtles and coral were among the items seized by Heathrow officials

Mr Miller (pictured above with big cat skulls) said the dramatic rise in seizures was not due to domestic demand but new wealth in China and the Far East



Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'Organised criminal gangs will smuggle anything if they think there is a profit to be made and animal products can be worth millions of pounds on the black market'

Nearly four tonnes of health and slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year

This figure is likely to represent only a small fraction of the ivory that is being illegally poached in Africa, which is then transformed into intricately carved jewellery and decorations for Chinese buyers keen to exhibit their wealth.

Nearly four tonnes of health and slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year, as illegal imports increased more than seven-fold in just 12 months.

The lucrative smuggling trade also involves live animals, with 466 endangered Hermann’s tortoises seized at Heathrow Airport this month.

Other exotic animals rescued in the past year include a Geoffroy’s cat, two King vultures and a tayra, a weasel-like mammal from south America.



In September, Foreign Secretary William Hague warned the illegal trade in wildlife is now worth $19billion (£11.8bn) globally, and ‘the profits from the trade pose an increasing threat to security by funding criminal gangs and terrorism’.

Officials said most seizures were small packages of illegal goods sent by courier from Africa to Asia, normally weighing less than 15kg (33lb), which are seized as they transit through hubs like Heathrow

The illegal trade of ivory is growing globally, with an estimated 17,000 elephants poached in 2011 alone

Although the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989, customs officials are intercepting increasing amounts each year as they pass through Heathrow.



In total, more than 2.5 million illegal items were seized last year - worth tens of millions - compared to 250,000 in 2011.



One of the confiscated items includes a piece of artwork consisting of an endangered Fischer’s lovebird sitting on a grenade, valued at £8,000.



Senior border force officer Grant Miller said the dramatic rise in seizures was not due to domestic demand, but new wealth in China and the Far East.

‘It is driven by human greed, particularly consumer demand in China and the Far East. People now have money they can spend, and ivory and rhino horn is seen as a status symbol - it allows them to show off their wealth,’ he said.

Officials said most seizures were small packages of illegal goods sent by courier from Africa to Asia, normally weighing less than 15kg (33lb), which are seized as they transit through hubs like Heathrow.

He added: ‘Chinese workers in Africa buy small amounts with their wages each month to sell at a huge profit back home.’



The illegal trade of ivory is growing globally, with an estimated 17,000 elephants poached in 2011 alone.



Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Organised criminal gangs will smuggle anything if they think there is a profit to be made and animal products can be worth millions of pounds on the black market.



‘The fact that this trade is contributing to the threat of extinction faced by many endangered species is of no interest to these ruthless traffickers.



'Border Force’s specialist officers are world renowned for their excellence in identifying and preventing the trade of illegal animal and plant material.



‘Officers are working tirelessly with partners in the National Crime Agency, the police and internationally to stamp out this illicit trade.’



Mr Miller said the biggest shift has been in the beauty and fitness industries, where endangered species once used only in folk medicines are being sold as bodybuilding supplements and facial creams.



He added: 'The market is evolving - there is more demand from a wider set of consumers.



'From the traditional Chinese medicine products that we used to seeing, we're now seeing new age beauty products, the health and fitness slimming pills, that are having endangered species within their ingredients.'



While much of the trade is in rising Asian markets like China and Vietnam, Britain's position as a global logistics hub means CITES goods often come through its borders.



This year 500kg of face cream containing caviar extract were discovered being imported from China, while 126,000 pots of Detonate and 15,120 of CRAZE - bodybuilding supplements containing the rare orchid Dendrobium - were seized en route from the US.



In May, a Manchester man received six months in prison for trying to import 750kg of live coral from Vietnam.

Rhino horns, tortoises and big cats, pinned butterflies and boxes of Detonate bodybuilding supplements - these are just some of the items being smuggled into Britain, according to border officials.

The Home Office has revealed that more items were confiscated between April 2012 and April 2013 than in any other year.



Other contraband included £4,000 shawls made of Tibetan antelope wool and books bound in elephant hide.



Grant Miller, the senior officer on the Border Force team, said: 'We have everything from rhino horn to ivory to the taxidermy items and marine species that we see being brought back into the UK, both in passengers' luggage - but more importantly, and in large quantities, through freight.'

In total, more than 2.5 million illegal items were seized last year - worth tens of millions - compared to 250,000 in 2011

Items are confiscated at the border under the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES).



The 2012/13 year saw 690 items seized - up from 509 the previous year - and included 3,890kg of medicine containing extracts of endangered species, 326 ivory items and 93 live animals.



In the climate-controlled warehouse, shelves overflow with items waiting for CITES experts to see if they fall under the treaty.



Jan Sowa, who works with the CITES team, said: 'I'm not surprised by anything any more.'

One piece of ivory taken from a baby elephant was painted black to disguise it as a wooden artifact, while 12 bangles were wrapped in raffia.

Taxidermied turtles and coral were among the items seized by Heathrow officials

Mr Miller (pictured above with big cat skulls) said the dramatic rise in seizures was not due to domestic demand but new wealth in China and the Far East



Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: 'Organised criminal gangs will smuggle anything if they think there is a profit to be made and animal products can be worth millions of pounds on the black market'

Nearly four tonnes of health and slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year

This figure is likely to represent only a small fraction of the ivory that is being illegally poached in Africa, which is then transformed into intricately carved jewellery and decorations for Chinese buyers keen to exhibit their wealth.

Nearly four tonnes of health and slimming supplements containing endangered plants and animals - from rhino horn to rare orchids - were also impounded last year, as illegal imports increased more than seven-fold in just 12 months.

The lucrative smuggling trade also involves live animals, with 466 endangered Hermann’s tortoises seized at Heathrow Airport this month.

Other exotic animals rescued in the past year include a Geoffroy’s cat, two King vultures and a tayra, a weasel-like mammal from south America.



In September, Foreign Secretary William Hague warned the illegal trade in wildlife is now worth $19billion (£11.8bn) globally, and ‘the profits from the trade pose an increasing threat to security by funding criminal gangs and terrorism’.

This marine turtle is among the massive haul of illegal goods seized by customs officers in London



Officials said most seizures were small packages of illegal goods sent by courier from Africa to Asia, normally weighing less than 15kg (33lb), which are seized as they transit through hubs like Heathrow

The illegal trade of ivory is growing globally, with an estimated 17,000 elephants poached in 2011 alone

Although the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989, customs officials are intercepting increasing amounts each year as they pass through Heathrow.



In total, more than 2.5 million illegal items were seized last year - worth tens of millions - compared to 250,000 in 2011.



One of the confiscated items includes a piece of artwork consisting of an endangered Fischer’s lovebird sitting on a grenade, valued at £8,000.



Senior border force officer Grant Miller said the dramatic rise in seizures was not due to domestic demand, but new wealth in China and the Far East.

‘It is driven by human greed, particularly consumer demand in China and the Far East. People now have money they can spend, and ivory and rhino horn is seen as a status symbol - it allows them to show off their wealth,’ he said.

‘Increasing economic activity of Chinese in Africa is also to blame, as it gives them direct access to ivory.’



Officials said most seizures were small packages of illegal goods sent by courier from Africa to Asia, normally weighing less than 15kg (33lb), which are seized as they transit through hubs like Heathrow.

He added: ‘Chinese workers in Africa buy small amounts with their wages each month to sell at a huge profit back home.’



The illegal trade of ivory is growing globally, with an estimated 17,000 elephants poached in 2011 alone.



Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Organised criminal gangs will smuggle anything if they think there is a profit to be made and animal products can be worth millions of pounds on the black market.



‘The fact that this trade is contributing to the threat of extinction faced by many endangered species is of no interest to these ruthless traffickers.



'Border Force’s specialist officers are world renowned for their excellence in identifying and preventing the trade of illegal animal and plant material.



‘Officers are working tirelessly with partners in the National Crime Agency, the police and internationally to stamp out this illicit trade.’



Mr Miller said the biggest shift has been in the beauty and fitness industries, where endangered species once used only in folk medicines are being sold as bodybuilding supplements and facial creams.



He added: 'The market is evolving - there is more demand from a wider set of consumers.



'From the traditional Chinese medicine products that we used to seeing, we're now seeing new age beauty products, the health and fitness slimming pills, that are having endangered species within their ingredients.'



While much of the trade is in rising Asian markets like China and Vietnam, Britain's position as a global logistics hub means CITES goods often come through its borders.



This year 500kg of face cream containing caviar extract were discovered being imported from China, while 126,000 pots of Detonate and 15,120 of CRAZE - bodybuilding supplements containing the rare orchid Dendrobium - were seized en route from the US.



In May, a Manchester man received six months in prison for trying to import 750kg of live coral from Vietnam.

Mr Miller also cited the seizure of 2.3 tonnes of Indian Red Sandalwood on its way to Hong Kong as 'carpets and Indian handicrafts'.

17,"A juvenile monkey found alone and freezing near a nature reserve in northwest Yunnan has slowly been nursed back to health by conservation officials. Referred to as the Nu River golden monkey (怒江金丝猴) in Chinese, the species is one of the most endangered primates in the world and this is the first instance of one ever being kept alive in captivity.

The monkey was found in September in Lushui County (泸水县), roughly 150 kilometers northwest of Dali. A Lisu woman who was collecting herbs in the mountains came across the animal and, after realizing it was alone and hungry, decided to take it home. She then contacted local Wildlife Conservation Management Committee officials who then delivered the primate to researchers at the Nu River Nature Reserve (NRNR).

For the past two months the monkey has been under the care of NRNR workers, who initially struggled to find a proper diet for the animal. Apples and bananas were originally offered and subsequently refused by the monkey. Handlers eventually began offering a steady supply of different wild plants collected from the Gaoligong Mountains (高黎贡山). The number of plant species so far eaten by the juvenile have risen to 15.

The juvenile, which is estimated to be between two and three years old, is now reported to be in relatively good health, although zoologists are still concerned about its weight and growth. To make the animal more comfortable, the NRNR has constructed a 180-square meter enclosure and filled it with indigenous plant species. Researchers have not announced plans to release the primate and are reportedly concerned it will be extremely difficult to locate a troop of monkeys to adopt the juvenile.

Nu golden monkeys were unknown to science until they were first identified three years ago in Myanmar. Given the Latin name Rhinopithecus strykeri, the animals are referred to outside of China as Myanmar Snub-nosed Monkeys. According to conservation group International Rivers:

...its defining features are its black fur, white face and chest, and a propensity to sneeze when it rains. It is the world's fifth subspecies of the snub-nosed monkey. China is now home to four species of snub-nosed monkeys: the Sichuan golden hair monkey (or Golden snub-nosed monkey), the Black (or Yunnan) snub-nosed monkey, the Gray (or Guizhou) snub-nosed monkey, and now the Myanmar (or Nujiang) snub-nosed monkey. The fifth species, the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey, is endemic to northwest Vietnam.

Populations were first identified in Yunnan in 2012 using DNA samples. Their existence in China was later confirmed when forestry workers in the Gaoligong Mountains were able to take photos of a group numbering between 60 and 80 animals later the same year. The Yunnan government, increasingly aided by both domestic and foreign conservation groups, has made sporadic progress with regards to wildlife preservation over the past decade.

Efforts such as these have resulted in some animals, such as the black snub-nosed monkey (滇金丝猴), rebounding from near extinction. Stronger ecological protection efforts, a more educated public and strict anti-poaching initiatives have been credited for advancements in Yunnan wildlife conservation.

18,"It’s easier to relate to someone you have something in common with; that feeling of connection can turn strangers into friends. And if those strangers belong to an entirely different species, then attributing human qualities to that species – a process called anthropomorphism – may aid conservation efforts by attracting public attention and funding resources. Charismatic species such as dolphins, pandas and chimpanzees are most often tagged with human types of traits. However, in a paper published in Biodiversity Conservation, a group of conservationists makes the case that the wallflowers of wildlife – the “less attractive” species – could also be helped through anthropomorphism.

According to the researchers, anthropomorphism is an important way in which people make sense of their interactions with the non-human world. When there is a sense of connection, there is often a stronger commitment to conservation. However, scientists have long been wary of anthropomorphism because it was seen as leading to unscientific hypotheses about animal behavior, according to co-author Meredith Root-Bernstein from the University of Oxford.





Attributing human features to animals is one form of anthropomorphism. Photo by: Barb Howe.

“I take a utilitarian view,” Root-Bernstein told mongabay.com. “I think the question is: what is the anthropomorphization for? What do you want to communicate with it?”

There isn’t one set definition of anthropomorphism. The human qualities attributed to animals are on a sliding scale of intensity. It could take the form of making images of animals with more human-like features, such as rounded eyes that face forward. Or it might include giving animals emotions that people experience, such as happiness or sadness. Depicting animals wearing human clothes or engaging in human activities also evokes human feelings of empathy, something the entertainment industry has long taken advantage of in films such as “Every Which Way But Loose,” a 1978 adventure movie starring Clint Eastwood and his orangutan sidekick, “Clyde.”

“The way to use anthropomorphism depends on the audience and the circumstances,” Root-Bernstein said. “In zoos, for example, one often gets the opportunity to see animals doing things that are part of their daily routines, which can be compared to human daily activities like schedules, chores and mealtimes.”

According to Root-Bernstein, this kind of anthropomorphism might make it easier to communicate the experience of being another species. Zoos traditionally use gift store items such as stuffed animal toys as a kind of take-home outreach, as these toys can elicit empathy by integrating human and non-human features. A previous study published in Ecopsychology found exhibits that made more comparisons to humans tended to evoke higher ratings of support for helping animals.

“But just because we can use it – should we?” said Kim-Pong Tam, a social scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology whose research has shown that anthropomorphism fosters conservation behavior by enhancing a person’s sense of connection to nature.

The effects of anthropomorphism aren’t always beneficial. In Japan, thousands of raccoons were imported for the pet trade in the 1970s after a cartoon series made the bandit-faced animals popular. When the raccoons acted like the wild animals they were instead of cute, well-behaved cartoon characters, many disenchanted owners sent them packing. The sudden release of non-native raccoons into the outdoors resulted in an expensive, nationwide eradication program that failed to rid the island of this invasive species. Since then, raccoons have spread throughout Japan, causing significant damage to crops and ancient temples.

Another unintended consequence of anthropomorphism can arise when empathy for individual animals doesn’t generalize to a whole species. This can create conflicts in zoos where breeding programs or budgets require culling of animals, a situation that recently sparked public outcry when a young giraffe was euthanized due to a surplus in its herd at the Copenhagen zoo.

The status of flagship or mascot animals can also cause less favor to fall upon other species. For example, when the imperial parrot (Amazona imperialis) became the national bird of the Caribbean island of Dominica, it also became associated with style and sophistication while its sister species, the red-necked parrot (Amazona arausiaca), came to be seen as an undeserving competitor. The disparity in status between the birds led to poorer conservation efforts for the less-exalted bird. In anthropomorphic terms, you could call it the “ugly stepsister effect. ”

“We aren’t saying you shouldn’t be cautious about using anthropomorphism,” Root-Bernstein said. “We are saying that the more you know about it, the better you can use it.” She hopes the researchers’ work will help conservationists understand why they might want to use different forms of anthropomorphism in different circumstances, and how to choose between types of anthropomorphism more deliberately.

“I’m all ‘yes’ about the use of anthropomorphism for conservation,” said Will Turner, chief scientist for Conservation International. “To me the issue isn’t so much about conveying that animals have human qualities so much as it is about using the human lens to help people relate to other species in the first place. Even the most empathetic among us has to use a human lens.”

(06/11/2013) Borneo is a vast tropical island known for orangutans, rhinos, elephants, sun bears, proboscis monkeys, hornbills, and ubiquitous leeches. Conservationists have championed all of these species (aside from the leeches) in one way or another, but like many tropical regions Borneo’s freshwater species have long been neglected, despite their rich biodiversity and importance to local people.

With it’s fuzzy dark fur, long tail and snout, and tiny ears, it’s difficult to imagine a more adorable animal. It’s also difficult to imagine that the tenkile is one of the most endangered species on Earth: only an estimated 300 remain. According to the Tenkile Conservation Alliance (TCA), the tenkile’s trouble stems from a sharp increase of human settlements in the Torricelli mountain range. Once relatively isolated, the tenkile now struggles to avoid hunters and towns while still having sufficient range to live in.

(05/21/2013) Drawing from her personal experience as a primate educator and the challenges she saw others facing, Amy Clanin envisioned a network that would advance the field of primate conservation education by addressing three needs of educators: connections, resources, and services. It was this vision that led her to create the Primate Education Network (PEN). PEN is at the forefront of primate conservation education, providing a community and collaboration platform for primate educators.",PET TRADE

Members of Paiute Tribe claim dark secrets are concealed in the lake

Pyramid Lake, in Nevada, is used as the default iPad screensaver

It is famous the world over as the picturesque setting of the default iPad screensaver.

But while the beautiful Pyramid Lake, in Nevada, may look tranquil, legend has it the spirits of sick children and a heartbroken mermaid lurk beneath its waters.

Members of a Native American Paiute Tribe, who have lived by the 350 foot sink for centuries, claim dark secrets are concealed in the depths of the lake.

The beautiful Pyramid Lake, in Nevada, is known the world over as the default iPad screensaver - but some claim dark secrets are concealed in its depths

Members of the Native American Paiute Tribe, who have lived by the 350 foot sink for centuries, believe the lake is haunted by the ghosts of disabled and premature infants thrown into it

According to the myth, the lake is haunted by the ghosts of disabled and premature infants thrown into it.

Visitors have reportedly heard the cries of the 'Water Babies', who were hurled into the lake because they would not survive the harsh desert climate.

It is also said to be home to a mermaid who married a member of the tribe but became embittered after being banished from the village.

She apparently swore revenge on anyone who came too close to the water's edge, and locals warn of the dangers of straying close to the shoreline.

The saying goes: 'If you hear them you will have bad luck, if you see them you are dead.'

Landscape gardener Simon Robinson, 37, spent a day by the lake because he is a 'big iPad fan' and wanted to see where the shot was taken.

Mr Robinson said: 'I'd heard it had was one of the most spectacular desert lakes in the world.



'I only heard about the legend when I was filling my car with petrol and the Native American woman at the garage asked me what had brought me there.

'She said they have a few Apple fans coming through and she always tells them the legend of the ""Water Babies"" and the mermaid.



'She said she didn't believe herself, but enough people in the area had heard or knew people who had heard strange childish voices by the lake.

'It happens especially in spring.

Mr Robinson said: 'When I asked, he said that of course he had heard of the legends and he knew that fisherman drowned each spring.

20,"Great news from the Truckee River: Pyramid Lake's population of Lahontan cutthroat trout has been seen spawning in the river for the for the first time since 1938. And it's only due to a lucky break that the Pyramid Lake population of cutthroats hasn't been extinct since then.

The Lahontan cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarki henshawi, is named for the patch of bright red that appears under its chin during spawning season. It once swam in lakes and streams all up and down the east side of the Sierra Nevada. Pyramid Lake's population, which provided early 20th-century anglers with record-breaking catches weighing up to 41 pounds, ranged from that brackish desert lake north of Reno all the way up the 121-mile-long Truckee River to Lake Tahoe.

But overfishing and introduced competitors like the Mackinaw eliminated the Lahontan cutthroat from Tahoe by the mid-1930s, and dam-building on the river's lower reaches above the point where it flows into Pyramid Lake took away too much spawning habitat for the fish to survive without help. By 1944, Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroat were gone from Pyramid Lake.

But as it happens, someone planted a few Pyramid Lake cutthroats in a stream in the Pilot Mountains 400 miles away near the Utah border. They did well there, and after genetic testing done by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proved the Pilot Peak cutthroats definitely descended from the Pyramid Lake population, USFWS planted some of them in Pyramid Lake in 2006.

This April, biologists from the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, on whose reservation the 188 square mile lake sits, noticed spawning nests being dug in the gravel of the Truckee River below Marble Bluff Dam. Tests showed the trout digging those nests were indeed Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroat, making this spring the run's first spawn since 1938. Since April, as many as 89 fish have spawned in the short stretch of river below the dam.

Across its range, the Lahontan cutthroat is listed as Threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act. In other streams across its range, the Lahontan cutthroat is vulnerable to low flows and too-warm water due to water diversions for agriculture and residential use. It's also threatened by non-native trout species planted for anglers' enjoyment: lake trout eat the fish or their eggs, while rainbow trout interbreed with cutthroats, giving rise to hybrids called ""cutbows.""

A couple of miles of spawning habitat is admittedly meager compared to the 121 miles of the historic Truckee. In the 1970s a bypass channel, the ""Pyramid Lake Fishway,"" was built to provide access to the river above Marble Bluff Dam for cutthroats and the lake's other listed fish, the cui-ui. Declining lake levels stranded the outlet of the Fishway, making it unusable by fish. A 2000 feasibility study for reconfiguring the Pyramid Lake Fishway so that it might actually be accessible to Pyramid Lake fish would seem to have had little effect, if Google Maps satellite views of the fishway are any indication. The outlet remains bone dry and unconnected to the lake.

Still, it's cause for celebration. Three generations of trout fans have grown up knowing that Pyramid Lake's original cutthroat trout were gone forever. Now that turns out to have been temporary.

21,"Andrew and I (along with several co-authors) have a new paper out in the journal Marine Policy entitled “Trophy Fishing for Species Threatened with Extinction: A way Forward Based on a History of Conservation.” You can read the paper here, and view the official press release here (will be up soon) .

We believe that this is an important topic that does not get enough attention, and we wrote the paper to review the scope of the problem, propose an easily achievable solution, and facilitate a long overdue discussion. Although we intentionally wrote the paper to be accessible to anyone, this blog post serves to explain the concepts and issues in the paper even further. We are happy to answer any questions people have about the paper, just ask them in the comments section below.

What is trophy fishing? Trophy fishing is when recreational anglers target the largest individuals of a species with the goal of catching a “world record” sized fish. These world record certificates are considered extremely prestigious in the angling community, and the desire to get such a record contributes to fishing pressure on many species of fish.

Who certifies these official world records? The largest organization that certifies world record catches, by far, is the International Game Fishing Association, or IGFA. The IGFA has more than 15,000 members in over 100 countries. The IGFA are also considered thought leaders in ethical angling practices, and many of the smaller organizations follow their lead.

Does trophy fishing require killing the fish? Record-setting fish must be weighed at an official IGFA weigh station. For many species of fish, the process of transporting a fish to one of these weigh stations implicitly requires killing the fish.

Is trophy fishing an ecological problem? Not necessarily, but it can be for some species. For many species of fish, the number of offspring they can have is based on how big they are. This means that larger individuals can have many more offspring, and removing the largest individuals has a disproportionate impact on the population dynamics of a species. For example, removing just one large 61 centimeter long red snapper from the population is the equivalent of removing over 200 smaller 41 centimeter long red snappers from the population. Fish species with healthy populations can withstand the disproportionate impact of trophy fishing, but for species with already reduced populations, selectively removing the largest individuals can impede population recovery or even contribute to decline.

How many species of fish are targeted by trophy fishing? The IGFA has issued all-tackle world records for 1,222 species of fish. This includes 85 species that are considered Threatened with Extinction (Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered) by the IUCN Red List. Some of these species you’ve probably heard of, like the great hammerhead shark or the bluefin tuna. Some you probably have not heard of, like the apache trout, cui-ui, or giant pangasius (shown in the upper right).

Isn’t it illegal to kill a Threatened or Endangered species of fish? IUCN Red List assessments are made by an international team of scientific experts, but they do not inherently carry the force of law. Some species listed as Threatened by the IUCN Red List are also illegal to catch in some or all of their range, but most are not. We believe that it is time to reconsider the ethics of killing the largest individuals of IUCN Red List Threatened species, as “not illegal” does not mean “ethical.”

Isn’t commercial fishing a bigger threat than recreational fishing? Generally speaking, of course it is. In fact, 81 of the 85 IUCN Red List Threatened species we identified in this study have a current or historical commercial fishery associated with them. However, scientists have known for years that recreational fishing can also have a huge ecological impact, and for some species of fish, commercial fishing isn’t permitted but recreational fishing is. Also, it does not matter what originally caused the population declines in these fish, what matters it their populations have declined so much that an international team of scientific experts says that they are Threatened with extinction (and therefore, we believe, ethical trophy anglers should no longer target them). Finally, saying that larger problems exist does not mean that this is not a problem.

Are you anti-fishing? No, we are not anti-fishing. I grew up fishing with my grandfather, who was an early proponent of catch and release for fish you weren’t going to eat. Andrew’s bachelor party (I was the best man) was a day of deep sea fishing for mahi, which we grilled and ate with his family. Fishing for fun and for food is culturally and economically important in the United States. However, as there is an ethical difference between hunting an overpopulated deer that you plan on eating and hunting an endangered rhino so you can mount its head on your wall, there is an ethical difference between fishing for fish with healthy populations and fishing for fish that an international team of scientific experts say are Threatened with extinction.

What can be done? In our paper, we suggest a simple solution: if the IGFA announced that they are no longer issuing world records for IUCN Red List Threatened species, that will reduce fishing pressure on these Threatened species while still allowing trophy fishing for more than 90% of the species that the IGFA has issued all-tackle world records for in the past.

Will the IGFA support your plan? The IGFA has a long history of supporting ocean conservation measures, and their mission statements asserts that they are “committed to the conservation of game fish and the promotion of responsible, ethical angling practices.” The subtitle of our paper is “a way forward building on a history of conservation” for a reason. We believe that “don’t fish for IUCN Red List Threatened species” is an important step in ethical recreational angling, and we hope that the IGFA agrees.

22,"From afar, the blue-green rooftops of Amanoi barely stand out against the scrubby, verdant landscape of this quiet coastal corner of southern Vietnam. Up close, though, it's quickly apparent how the Aman hotel chain has upped the ante in Vietnam's nascent but growing luxury travel market. The uber chic guest pavilions and villas are spread out over a 40-hectare property, making little white buggies the indispensable mode of transportation. Here and there, large boulders dot the landscape, seemingly dropped down from the sky.

Location, location

Getting to Amanoi is no easy feat. It's a 90-minute drive from the closest airport, which is a one-hour flight from Ho Chi Minh City and a nearly two-hour hop from Hanoi. The journey, though, is well worth it. The hotel feels remote, secluded and special. It sits next to the 29,000 hectare Nui Chua National Park, known for its adorable black-shanked douc monkeys, and just down the road from a small fishing village.

Story continues below advertisement

Design

Cruising into the property, guests pass the tennis courts but little else on the winding, uphill drive to the central pavilion. Take the wide staircase to the main restaurant, where the terrace overlooks cliffs, valleys and the East Sea (the Vietnamese name for the South China Sea). The upper area is breezy and the bar comes complete with comfy brown-leather chairs and charming rockers. In the library, even board games are styled: their garish boxes replaced by simple black ones with stencilled names. The guest pavilions and villas feel contemporary, but also have traditional Vietnamese touches such as woven-grass ceilings and long, red hanging lamps.

Room with a view

You can't go wrong here. The ultra-private pavilions and villas overlook either the park, a lake or Vinh Hy Bay and the sea. We stayed in a pool pavilion and enjoyed waking up at dawn to watch the fishing boats chug back ashore and hear the birds chatter in the trees.

Best amenity

Definitely it's the wealth of health and recreation options. In particular, the two pools: One is on a cliff (#stunningview) and the other is at the beach club, just metres from the shore. Both are suitable for soaking and laps.

If I could change one thing

As the high-end hotel industry expands in Asia, finding staff proficient in English continues to be a challenge. Amanoi is no exception. Some of our requests were met with smiles and nods, but confused follow through. In one case, we asked our buggy driver to take us back to our room and ended up at the beach club. There are strong English speakers on staff, but not enough of them.

Whom you'll meet

Up close, though, it's quickly apparent how the Aman hotel chain has upped the ante in Vietnam's nascent but growing luxury travel market. The uber chic guest pavilions and villas are spread out over a 40-hectare property, making little white buggies the indispensable mode of transportation. Here and there, large boulders dot the landscape, seemingly dropped down from the sky.

Location, location

Getting to Amanoi is no easy feat. It's a 90-minute drive from the closest airport, which is a one-hour flight from Ho Chi Minh City and a nearly two-hour hop from Hanoi. The journey, though, is well worth it. The hotel feels remote, secluded and special. It sits next to the 29,000 hectare Nui Chua National Park, known for its adorable black-shanked douc monkeys, and just down the road from a small fishing village.

Design

Cruising into the property, guests pass the tennis courts but little else on the winding, uphill drive to the central pavilion. Take the wide staircase to the main restaurant, where the terrace overlooks cliffs, valleys and the East Sea (the Vietnamese name for the South China Sea). The upper area is breezy and the bar comes complete with comfy brown-leather chairs and charming rockers. In the library, even board games are styled: their garish boxes replaced by simple black ones with stencilled names. The guest pavilions and villas feel contemporary, but also have traditional Vietnamese touches such as woven-grass ceilings and long, red hanging lamps.

Room with a view

You can't go wrong here. The ultra-private pavilions and villas overlook either the park, a lake or Vinh Hy Bay and the sea. We stayed in a pool pavilion and enjoyed waking up at dawn to watch the fishing boats chug back ashore and hear the birds chatter in the trees.

Best amenity

Definitely it's the wealth of health and recreation options. In particular, the two pools: One is on a cliff (#stunningview) and the other is at the beach club, just metres from the shore. Both are suitable for soaking and laps.

As the high-end hotel industry expands in Asia, finding staff proficient in English continues to be a challenge. Amanoi is no exception. Some of our requests were met with smiles and nods, but confused follow through. In one case, we asked our buggy driver to take us back to our room and ended up at the beach club. There are strong English speakers on staff, but not enough of them.

23,"On a small island jutting out of the grey seas of Foveaux Strait, the Department of Conservation and its partners work hard to save a critically endangered yet captivating species. Neil Ratley hitches a ride to Whenua Hou/Codfish Island to meet the rare kakapo and some of the people helping them fight back from the brink of extinction.

Even on a remote island, there is no privacy on the privy.

On my short walk through the forest to the composting toilet, I can't shake the feeling I am being watched from the darkness. I tell myself if you can't go to the toilet in peace on an island sanctuary in the middle of Foveaux Strait, accessible only by a sanctioned flight, you won't find alone time anywhere.

There is a rustle in the undergrowth and I hear movement behind me. I spin around. A ball of moss waddles towards me before growling like a dog. The light from my head torch reflects back two beady eyes peering from an iridescent green clump of feathers. In the darkness on Whenua Hou or Codfish Island, I am shin to beak with one of the world's most unique and critically endangered species - the kakapo.

Hakatere is one of only 126 living kakapo on the planet.

After a short Mexican stand-off, I back away slowly, and Hakatere allows me to finish my business.

Hakatere's recent habit of following folk to the toilet will be short-lived.

Kakapo Recovery Programme manager Diedre Vercoe Scott says the young female most likely ventured close to staff quarters because she was curious about the three kakapo chicks that had been hand-reared in a nearby enclosure.

The three chicks are now old enough to be released into the wilds of the island, an event I will be fortunate to witness. Hakatere's nights of loitering near the toilets will be over and she will slip away into the bush.

My adventure to Whenua Hou begins early on a blustery Southland morning. I am told to arrive at the DOC quarantine centre in Invercargill after doing a thorough wash and check of my bags, clothes and shoes. All visitors to the island pose a threat by inadvertently bringing along with them disease, unwanted pests such as rodents, invertebrates or weed species.

The centre is only a short distance from my home so I decide to walk. Janice at quarantine is suitably impressed by my efforts not to endanger a species that had fought back from the brink of extinction. ""You didn't have to wear the plastic bags over your shoes. We disinfect them here before we put you on the plane,"" she says with a smile.

Janice takes her job seriously. She has to. A stray seed, a sneaky spider or stowaway rodent could potentially wipe out the kakapo and destroy the recovery work that started when kakapo, thought to be extinct, were discovered in remote Fiordland valleys and on Stewart Island in the 1970s.

I make it through quarantine and meet up with Vercoe Scott, who is in charge of growing the kakapo population.

We are ferried by minivan to the airport. Strong winds on Whenua Hou mean pilot Raymond Hector has to decide if it's safe to land on the strip of sand used as a runway on the island. With the sky brightening, the veteran flyer loads us into the single engine Cessna. The horizon begins to clear and below the whitecaps whip across Foveaux Strait. Stewart Island looms and the aptly named Ruggedy Mountains appear from beneath a soft blanket of fog.

The white curved smile of Sealers Bay, the island's only sand beach, comes into view. Hector banks sharply, dipping the Cessna. He completes a pass to test the winds and water line. Years of flying staff and supplies to Whenua Hou make landing on a patch of sand a routine task for the experienced pilot. I step onto the pristine beach and the home of the kakapo.

Whenua Hou lies about 3km off the wild west coast of Stewart Island. The thick vegetation is mixed rimu, totara, miro, rata forest, coastal hebe and pakihi shrubland on the upper plateau. Pest eradication provides kakapo with a safe 1400ha home that is very similar to their original habitat of Stewart Island. The island's coastline of rugged cliffs and boulder beaches also harbour breeding colonies of a petrels and penguins.

The kakapo on Whenua Hou are mostly allowed to get on with their lives in their natural environment. Vercoe Scott says staff use radio telemetry tracking, hours of walking around the island, and plenty of patience to monitor the rare parrots. But several times a year, staff and parrot need to interact. Birds sometimes have to be supplementary fed, eggs need collecting for artificial incubation and some chicks need to be hand-reared to survive their early days. Each bird also gets an annual check-up.

The forest path is dappled with sunlight as I follow Vercoe Scott and kakapo ranger Jenny deeper into the interior of Whenua Hou. The rangers both stop at regular intervals and extend the aerial for the telemetry receiver that is tuned into the kakapo we are looking for. Each bird wears a unique smart transmitter. It is Ihi's turn for a check-up. But the young female appears to be reluctant for her jab and is leading us on a wild goose or kakapo chase. Faint signals make it difficult to pinpoint her exact location. We circumnavigate her territory, tramping through ferny gullies and up into the canopied ridges of the northeastern part of the island.

Ihi shows who is in charge and evades the rangers for the day. But they will have to track her down eventually. It is vital she is found to replace her radio transmitter to ensure the batteries are fresh. She also needs to be weighed, her moulting condition checked, blood samples taken and she has to be inspected for parasites. ""All the information is loaded on to a national database, which allows us to track and compare the life history of each individual bird and to build up a picture of the species,"" Vercoe Scott explains.

Apart from the occasional romantic dalliance, kakapo are solitary creatures and each bird occupies its own territory. They are nocturnal and lie low during the day using their moss colouring as camouflage. Although flightless, kakapo are excellent climbers and can parachute from the tall rimu and rata trees. Strong legs allow the kakapo to move significant distances with a quick shuffling gait reminiscent of a rotund shrunken drunken pirate. They have inquisitive owl-like eyes and bristling whisker-like feathers on a broad face. If they looked in the mirror, they would see an old man past the point of keeping up appearances.

Not even the arrival of Conservation Minister Nick Smith and DOC boss Lou Sanson to Whenua Hou will elicit a shave.

Kakapo were once abundant in New Zealand. Vercoe Scott says the kakapo's population used to be booming.

""There was a report from an early explorer, Charles Douglas, who said they were so populous you could shake them out of trees like apples. He said he'd once seen six kakapo shaken from a single tutu bush.""

However, introduced predators in the late 1800s such as stoats and cats decimated the population to the point where kakapo were a lost species. It was another 100 years before the discovery of 200 birds on Stewart Island provided hope the species could be saved.

Smith and Sanson, along with Tane Davis, chairman and iwi representative of the Whenua Hou Committee, and New Zealand Aluminium Smelters general manager Gretta Stephens, whose company sponsors the Kakapo Recovery Programme, fly in to help with the release of the three hand-reared kakapo chicks.

There were six chicks this breeding season, with the other three raised by their mothers or a surrogate mother in the wild. It is also a chance for the visiting dignitaries to hear how the programme continues to bring the species back from the abyss of extinction.

Vercoe Scott says there are four key aspects to the programme. They are reversing the decline of the population, improving species genetics, raising the profile of the kakapo and using technology to advance the programme.

""In the 1970s, kakapo were discovered on Stewart Island and a few in Fiordland. These founding birds were transferred to off-shore islands.

""There were less than 45 founder birds. Today, the younger birds of known age make up the majority of the population,"" Vercoe Scott says.

Kakapo are an inbred lot and genetically challenged, she says. ""A lot of work has been done to minimise further genetic loss. Birds are moved between sites, dominant breeding males are also moved around allowing even the duds to breed along with the studs.""

The older males are given a crack at the ladies by parking the younger males on another island. Artificial insemination and cryogenics are also being investigated. Frozen DNA will help make sure the genetic diversity today is around in the future, Vercoe Scott says.

""We could just leave the kakapo and in 50 years time there may still be some birds left. But they would be genetically poor,"" she says. ""It is vital to keep improving the genetic diversity of the population while we have 126 birds stretching back to the original males found on Stewart Island.""

The kakapo's profile has certainly risen during the past decade. They were even voted the world's favourite species in 2013. Vercoe Scott says before 2005, if you did not work for DOC or volunteer on the recovery programme, it was impossible to come face-to-beak with a kakapo. Since 2005, the species have had a champion spokesbird in the form of Sirocco. As a result of intensive hand-raising and lack of kakapo company, Sirocco was imprinted on humans and the call of the wild was less appealing than the call of being a superstar. The Kakapo Recovery team realised breeding was out but Sirocco's fondness for people could allow him to be an extremely good advocate for his species. About 5000 people a year now have a close encounter with a live kakapo, Vercoe Scott says.

Sirocco's popularity has DOC contemplating grooming an understudy to help with the star's demanding schedule.

Technology has become invaluable for the success of the Kakapo Recovery Programme. Vercoe Scott says the reality for DOC, like many organisations, is it needs to operate with less but without compromising its role to protect endangered species.

For the Kakapo Recovery Programme, being more cost effective means focusing on technology. The programme is developing and using sophisticated methods to monitor, feed and breed kakapo. Smart feeders will only open for a specific bird. Keeping a female kakapo at a certain weight has been found to make it more likely to have female chicks.

Technology also allows staff to monitor kakapo ""blind dates"". This year, data fed back from receivers showed who was mating with whom and how often and if a female was nesting. A fixed wing plane can collect this data saving manpower. Nests are remotely monitored with infra-red detectors and cameras allowing staff to access them when the female has gone for a wander. These advances will be essential if the kakapo numbers get too big and birds need to move to larger islands with more ground to cover.

The sun sinks into the sea and on the beach yellow-eyed penguins stroll like elegant gentlemen in dinner jackets out of the water and up into the dunes to nest. A nosy Campbell Island teal, a descendent of a transferred population, sniffs at our boots and waddles between our feet.

The boggy peaty track snakes up through the dark forest. It's a squelching climb with only our head torches illuminating the way. Our destination is a plateau where the three hand-reared kakapo chicks will be released. They will have to head off into the wild world of Whenua Hou and find their own territory. And hopefully in five or six years, themselves contribute to bumping up their species' numbers.

Three members from the Kakapo Recovery team have ascended the hill ahead of us and when we reach them it is time for the chicks to fly, well walk, the coop. Smith and Stephens get to do the honours and open the cages. The unkempt whiskery face of an old man pokes out. Wide eyes peer about before a clump of beautiful green and yellow black-flecked feathers wobbles past me. At about four months old, the young kakapo still have some growing to do but it is an unforgettable experience watching the world's largest parrot hop off into the darkness to join the ranks of a species fighting the battle for survival.

In the middle of the night, I reluctantly have to leave my warm sleeping bag when I get a call from nature. Half asleep I shuffle off - like a kakapo - into the forest canopy amid the ferns for privacy. A rustle and growl startles me awake.",Boom!

24,"You know the feeling well: You’re limping along in the gray Seattle mist when alas--the sun breaks, the clouds clear and our favorite mountain appears. So long, blues! Cancel that move to Los Angeles. Whether you favor Mount Rainier for its snow sport capacity this time of year or just its sweeping views from Seattle or Tacoma, it’s time honor the roots of our favorite local peak and revisit all it offers.

Mount Rainier today; photo credit: courtesy of the National Park Service

Most recognized for its colossal snow- and ice-covered volcanic centerpiece (the tallest in the Cascades), the 236,381-acre Mount Rainier National Park contains the largest of the Pacific Rim volcanoes, between California’s Mount Shasta to Mount Baker. The base of Rainier’s active volcano covers 100 square miles, and an average annual snowfall of 641 inches on its 25 separate glaciers make the park the biggest single peak glacier system in the U.S. outside of Alaska.

Ninety-seven percent wilderness, Mount Rainier became a national park in 1899, but its history starts much earlier. The mountain’s name dates back to 1792 when British explorer Captain George Vancouver branded it for his friend Admiral Peter Rainier, who never visited. In the 1850s, farmer James Longmire set up the Packwood Trail, and on August 17, 1870, Philemon Beecher Van Trump and Hazard Stevens completed the first documented summit of the mountain (14,411 feet)— nearly freezing to death, if not for a volcanic steam cave they found.

Eventually, a campaign began to preserve the area and in 1899, Mount Rainier was the fifth area in the country to become a national park. As roads and railways made the mountain more accessible, Rainier officials reported over a million visitors annually by the 1950s, and in 1962, the peak served as training turf for the first Mount Everest summit by Americans in 1963.

Today, Mount Rainier receives between a million and a half to two million visitors per year—including about 10,000 climbers who come from all over to scale it. In addition to climbing, the most popular activities are sightseeing, hiking and camping according to Curt Jacquot, West District Area Interpretive Ranger for Mount Rainier National Park. During winter, he reports there is also a lot of cross country skiing and snowshoeing in the snow play area at Paradise, usually open from late December through March. (Check here for updates on the exact schedule.)

According to Jacquot, the two most visited areas of the park are Paradise (so named because when James Longmire’s daughter-in-law Martha first saw the area, she reveled “Oh, what a paradise!”) and Sunrise. Celebrated for its lush wildflower views, Paradise is located about 19 miles east of the park’s Nisqualy entrance and houses the main visitor center in the park, located in the upper parking area. Paradise is also 12 miles east of the Longmire museum, the original park headquarters with historical relics from the park’s early years.

Located 1,000 feet above Paradise, Sunrise is the highest point that can be reached by vehicle at Mount Rainier National Park (at 6,400 feet elevation). It is home to most of the same activities as Paradise but according to Jacquot, it has more expansive views at sunrise (hence its name) and the flowers come out earlier. Sunrise is perched 60 miles northeast of the Nisqually Entrance and 14 miles northwest of the Sunrise/White River turnoff on Highway 410.

In addition to these two highlights, the 240 miles of trails in Mount Rainier National Park (including the 93-mile Wonderland Trail that circles the mountain) and the rainforest in the northwest corner (receiving more than 90 inches of rain per year) also add to the park’s glory, though check the status of roads before you visit: East roads on the mountain are closed in the winter.

Most recognized for its colossal snow- and ice-covered volcanic centerpiece (the tallest in the Cascades), the 236,381-acre Mount Rainier National Park contains the largest of the Pacific Rim volcanoes, between California’s Mount Shasta to Mount Baker. The base of Rainier’s active volcano covers 100 square miles, and an average annual snowfall of 641 inches on its 25 separate glaciers make the park the biggest single peak glacier system in the U.S. outside of Alaska.

Ninety-seven percent wilderness, Mount Rainier became a national park in 1899, but its history starts much earlier. The mountain’s name dates back to 1792 when British explorer Captain George Vancouver branded it for his friend Admiral Peter Rainier, who never visited. In the 1850s, farmer James Longmire set up the Packwood Trail, and on August 17, 1870, Philemon Beecher Van Trump and Hazard Stevens completed the first documented summit of the mountain (14,411 feet)— nearly freezing to death, if not for a volcanic steam cave they found.

Eventually, a campaign began to preserve the area and in 1899, Mount Rainier was the fifth area in the country to become a national park. As roads and railways made the mountain more accessible, Rainier officials reported over a million visitors annually by the 1950s, and in 1962, the peak served as training turf for the first Mount Everest summit by Americans in 1963.

Today, Mount Rainier receives between a million and a half to two million visitors per year—including about 10,000 climbers who come from all over to scale it. In addition to climbing, the most popular activities are sightseeing, hiking and camping according to Curt Jacquot, West District Area Interpretive Ranger for Mount Rainier National Park. During winter, he reports there is also a lot of cross country skiing and snowshoeing in the snow play area at Paradise, usually open from late December through March. (Check here for updates on the exact schedule.)

According to Jacquot, the two most visited areas of the park are Paradise (so named because when James Longmire’s daughter-in-law Martha first saw the area, she reveled “Oh, what a paradise!”) and Sunrise. Celebrated for its lush wildflower views, Paradise is located about 19 miles east of the park’s Nisqualy entrance and houses the main visitor center in the park, located in the upper parking area. Paradise is also 12 miles east of the Longmire museum, the original park headquarters with historical relics from the park’s early years.

Located 1,000 feet above Paradise, Sunrise is the highest point that can be reached by vehicle at Mount Rainier National Park (at 6,400 feet elevation). It is home to most of the same activities as Paradise but according to Jacquot, it has more expansive views at sunrise (hence its name) and the flowers come out earlier. Sunrise is perched 60 miles northeast of the Nisqually Entrance and 14 miles northwest of the Sunrise/White River turnoff on Highway 410.

In addition to these two highlights, the 240 miles of trails in Mount Rainier National Park (including the 93-mile Wonderland Trail that circles the mountain) and the rainforest in the northwest corner (receiving more than 90 inches of rain per year) also add to the park’s glory, though check the status of roads before you visit: East roads on the mountain are closed in the winter.

25,"Animals with black skin or fur are not black by chance, suggests new research, but because the dark coloration helps them live longer. The finding adds to the growing body of evidence that black coloration isn't just a product of genetic drift — happenstance in the course of evolution.

The coloration stems from melanism, or development of the dark-colored pigment melanin in the skin and its appendages (fur, hair, eyelashes, etc.). How melanism directly ties to better health, however, remains a mystery.

SEE ALSO: Monkey mustaches reveal evolution of facial hair

""We don't know for certain,"" said Gregory Barsh of the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, co-author of the study that appeared in PLOS Genetics. ""Factors such as foliage, humidity, temperature, and/or infectious agents are all possibilities, and could affect camouflage, resistance to heat or thermoregulation, or resistance to infections.""

He added that one of the most famous examples of melanism working to a species' advantage is the dark peppered moth, which blends in more easily in dark surroundings — offering better camouflage from prey.

Lead author Alexsandra Schneider, senior author Eduardo Eizirik and their colleagues have studied melanism before in other animals, but focused their work this time on three closely related South American wild cats: the pampas cat, the kodkod, and Geoffroy's cat. They identified the mutations responsible for melanism in the cats, and found that there was strong evidence for natural selection of black coloration, particularly for pampas cats.

Linking domestic cats and their wild counterparts, the researchers found that the same gene that causes melanism in the pampas cat and the kodkod also causes the rich black fur of certain leopards, panthers and jaguars, as well as house kitties that sport such a coat, Eizirik told Discovery News. He is a researcher at the Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio Grande do Sul and the Instituto Pro-Carnivoros, both of which are in Brazil.

SEE ALSO: Innovations inspired by animals

Barsh mentioned that, in an earlier study, he and his colleagues also found that ""black wolves may have increased fitness in some environments due to a melanism mutation in a different gene from the ones studied here."" Certain domesticated dogs may also benefit from darker fur colors, although breeding by humans now influences the process.

Research on baby owls conducted by another team found that melanism in these birds, via gene expression, may be tied to sleep patterns and even brain development.

Dark spots in owls corresponds to a range of behavioral traits which have been tied to immune system function and energy regulation in the animals, explained co-author Alexander Roulin from the University of Lausanne.

SEE ALSO: Cats have super, psychedelic vision

It could be that melanism's perks are compromised when a species moves to a place with a different climate and habitat.

""For example,"" Eizirik said, ""a small black cat may have increased fitness in a dark forest, but decreased fitness in an open field.""

In this case, even if the dark fur and skin help with immunity and other things, those would be lost if the animal is highly visible to predators.

As for humans, it appears that predation was not the greatest factor affecting gene expression for skin and hair coloration, at least during the more recent stages of human evolution.

26,"Supporters of the endangered Mexican gray wolf in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Tuesday demanded that state commissioners reverse their recent decision to close down a wolf recovery program.

The program, which has operated for 17 years at a New Mexico ranch owned by billionaire media mogul Ted Turner, has successfully released around 100 of the nearly extinct wolves back into the wild. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has called Ladder Ranch and two other prerelease facilities “integral” to Mexican wolf recovery efforts.

But now Ladder Ranch’s part in Mexican gray wolf recovery is in danger of disappearing, and its supporters charge that the reason is opposition to any federal policy that seeks the recovery of wolves in the wild.

A Controversial Vote

On May 7, New Mexico’s game and fish commissioners, all appointees of Gov. Susana Martinez, a Republican, withdrew state support for Mexican gray wolf recovery work at Turner’s Ladder Ranch.

For nearly two decades, the New Mexico game and fish commissioner routinely renewed Ladder Ranch’s permit. But this year, the commission raised new objections to the federal government’s handling of the wolf’s recovery.

“Our biggest issue is that there is no recovery plan in place,” said Alexa Sandoval, state game and fish director, during the May 7 meeting. “We don’t know what the end game is for the Mexican wolf population. And so at this point, the department is not in support of the Mexican Wolf Program.”

Michael Robinson, a wildlife conservation activist with the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, believes the commissioners are more motivated by a “vendetta” against the wolf species than the lack of a federal recovery plan.

“This group is appointed by Gov. Martinez, who has put representatives from the Cattle Growers Association—whose primary goal is the eradication of predators—and representatives from Big Game Forever, in favor of removing all wolves from the wild,” Robinson said. Since federal wildlife policies aim “They’re trying to force policy change by depriving managers of the infrastructure they need to manage the wolves.”

The commission has not responded to requests for comment on its decision.

In an editorial, the Albuquerque Journal called the commission’s decision “petty” and “unproductive,” noting that it came despite enthusiastic public support of the Ladder Ranch wolf recovery program. “Turner should be allowed to use his property as he wishes in cooperation with the federal government, and the commission shouldn’t flex its self-granted power to punish a private landowner to make a statement,” the paper said.

The 156,000-acre ranch, set in pine forests in the foothills of New Mexico’s Gila Mountains, provides critical habitat and management for endangered animals such as the black-footed ferret, the bolson tortoise, and the Mexican gray wolf.

About a half acre of the ranch is reserved for five special pens, where wolves about to be released into the wild are placed. In this “prerelease captive facility,” wolves encounter minimal human contact, and the animals are fed sparingly to acclimate them to life outside captive breeding programs.

“We’re just a very small component of a ship,” said Mike Phillips, executive director of the Turner Endangered Species Fund, who has worked in wolf recovery for 35 years. “A ship that the commission feels doesn’t have a rudder, so they’ve decided to oppose the ship’s components too.”

Dozens of different organizations have written to the governor in support of Ladder Ranch’s wolf recovery program, said Robinson, but their requests to reverse the commission’s decision have gone unacknowledged so far.

Back From the Brink

Long hunted to prevent wolf kills of cattle and elk, Mexican gray wolves had almost vanished by the mid-1950s. Once numbering in the thousands in their historical range of the southwestern U.S. and Mexico, the population was down to just seven animals by the time the species was given federal endangered species protection in 1976.

Related The Grand Canyon Wolf Is Dead

The federal government rounded up the last seven wild wolves to begin a captive breeding program, which has increased the Mexican gray wolf's numbers to 250 in captivity among some 55 facilities, including zoos, wildlife centers, and the three special “prerelease” centers that include Ladder Ranch.

Since 1998, when 11 Mexican gray wolves were released in Arizona and New Mexico, the population in the wild has grown to 109.

Still, nearly 40 years after gaining federal protections, the Mexican gray wolf has yet to get a full recovery plan. Federal wildlife officials have set a management “rule,” adjusted in January of this year, that increases the species’ roaming area about 10 times from its 1998 level and sets a goal of 300 to 325 wolves in the region.

But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service has never established a target population that would trigger the end of federal endangered species status, which provided an opening for unsympathetic game commissioners when Ladder Ranch’s permit came due for renewal.

“The million-dollar question is, how many wolves are enough?” asked Commissioner Thomas Salopek at the hearing. “One hundred? Three hundred? Is it going to be 500 or 1,000? I can’t go any further if we don’t have a known number.”

Sherry Barrett, Mexican wolf recovery coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, said that the agency is developing a formal recovery plan but that no timetable has been set for finishing it.

A Cloudy Future

Phillips said the future for Mexican gray wolves would be unclear even if Ladder Ranch wasn’t being forced to shut down its program.

The 18 or so free-roaming wolf packs in Arizona and New Mexico are slowly reproducing and reestablishing the species’ numbers. Many of the wolves in the wild today were born in the wild, not captivity.

But every Mexican gray wolf alive today is descended from a severe genetic bottleneck formed when the species was down to seven individuals—a “genetic disaster,” as Phillips sees it. So pups bred in captivity for release into the wild are crucial to restoring Mexican gray wolves, and any curb to those programs puts the whole species at risk.

“The clock is the Mexican wolves’ enemy,” Phillips told the commission before its controversial vote in May. “Every generation that passes is a little less genetically robust then it was before the clock started.”

Why You Should Care: Wild wolves are revered by many as symbols of freedom, nature, and true grit. But the need for healthy populations of Mexican gray and other wolf species goes beyond appreciating their good looks and charisma. As apex predators, wolves sit at the top of the food chain, where they’re crucial to ecosystem health. Wolf predation helps keep the populations of big herbivores such as elk and deer, as well as small animals like mice and rabbits, in balance with the surrounding ecosystem.",Billionaire’s Bid to Save Rare Wolves Ends Up on the Brink of Extinction,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGFrZXBhcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAxNS8wNS8yMi9tZXhpY2FuLWdyYXktd29sdmVzLXBlcm1pdC1yZXZva2Vk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/Mexican-gray-wolf-MAIN.jpg,2015-05-22,"{'sent': 'Supporters of the endangered Mexican gray wolf in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Tuesday demanded that state commissioners reverse their recent decision to close down a wolf recovery program.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Santa Fe', 'New Mexico']}}","Supporters of the endangered Mexican gray wolf in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Tuesday demanded that state commissioners reverse their recent decision to close down a wolf recovery program.

Hi, I’m Matt Morgan. I’m an Animal Keeper on the Birds and Pets Sections at Twycross Zoo, and I’ve been at the zoo since March 2012.

The Birds and Pets Section is the most varied of all the sections at Twycross Zoo. I work with birds, from tiny zebra finches to great big Darwin’s rhea (who look a bit like emus), reptiles like the giant tortoises, pet species such as rabbits and bearded dragons, farm animals, including our Leicester longwool sheep and creepy crawlies like our butterflies.

With so many different animals, it is tough to pick a favourite, but two do stand out - the miniature donkeys and the pelicans.

I have worked with our two miniature donkeys, Jack and William, right from the start and I’ve loved every minute of it. Just as people expect, they can be very stubborn and cheeky at times, but they also love attention and enjoy spending time with their keepers.

In some ways the pelicans’ personalities are quite similar to the donkeys, they are good at understanding their keepers and can sometimes be a bit sneaky - I have had them try to steal fish from my hands at feeding time!

My days can vary quite a lot depending on what animals I am working with that day, and it is the variety of the Birds and Pets Section that I really enjoy.

Typically, the day starts with checking the animals I am assigned for the day, before feeding and cleaning them out.

Some enclosures need raking and brushing, others need rocks scrubbing or refreshing straw beds. With so many different types of animal, it is important that their home suits their varied needs.

We try to get most of our cleaning done before the zoo opens so that the animals are visible to the visitors as we know you don’t visit to see us cleaning!

Next up is food preparation. Each animal has a very specific diet sheet which gives them all the necessary nutrients they require. You might be surprised to hear that presentation can be very important as some of our animals can be quite picky eaters. For example, if you try to feed a penguin a fish that isn’t perfect and offered head first it will be thrown on the floor!

In the afternoon I might prepare some enrichment for our animals to keep their minds active, or maybe do some enclosure maintenance or paperwork that I might have to catch up on. Being a zoo keeper encompasses many different types of work.

The end of the day is normally time for the last feeds and putting animals to bed. Even this can be tricky, if the sun is still shining it can be very difficult to persuade the 180kg giant tortoises to go inside!

People should visit Twycross Zoo to come to see our amazing animals and learn all about them. We’re known for our primates, but we also have a great collection of other animals with some real rarities, such as our pair of red-fronted macaw and Darwin’s rhea, these birds cannot be seen at many collections. Of course everyone should come and check out the donkeys too!

We are hoping to see some penguin chicks this year, as our penguins are threatened in the wild and by keeping them here at Twycross Zoo we can preserve a healthy population for the future. This means that it is not just exciting for the keepers when we get chicks, but also great news for the species as a whole, should they be needed to support penguin numbers in the wild.",Behind the Scenes at Twycross Zoo: Dealing with animals of all shapes and sizes,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmNrbGV5dGltZXMubmV0L25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9iZWhpbmQtc2NlbmVzLXR3eWNyb3NzLXpvby1kZWFsaW5nLTkzODk3MjTSAVxodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5ja2xleXRpbWVzLm5ldC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvYmVoaW5kLXNjZW5lcy10d3ljcm9zcy16b28tZGVhbGluZy05Mzg5NzI0LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i2-prod.hinckleytimes.net/incoming/article9389614.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS65011812.jpg,2015-06-07,"{'sent': 'Sign up to FREE email alerts from hinckleytimes - weekly Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Invalid Email\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Invalid Email']}}","Sign up to FREE email alerts from hinckleytimes - weekly Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Invalid Email

28,"On a warm November afternoon, Brooke Durham paced outside the El Cajon Valley Courthouse in San Diego, her topknot of pink-highlighted dreadlocks bouncing as she strode back and forth. Durham was there to spring 18 prisoners, all temporarily held in pet carriers on the ground. She was less anxious about breaking the law than about how the captives—parrots that grew up on the streets of Southern California—would fare once they were set loose. Durham and her team of accredited bird caregivers had nursed these vibrant green birds (all from the genus Amazona and native to Mexico, Central, and South America) back to health from various injuries: broken bones, head trauma, even electric shock. Now that they were fully healed, she was setting the jailbirds free—an act both unprecedented among parrot rehabbers and technically illegal in the eyes of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service—into a stand of trees where 500 or so Amazons regularly roost.

“I’m nervous as hell,” said Durham, who with her husband, Josh Bridwell, runs SoCal Parrot, a nonprofit naturalized-parrot rescue and rehab facility, out of their home in Jamul, California. Her anxiety didn’t show. But then Durham, 38, who rocks those colorful highlights, a nose ring, and dark eyeliner, has an almost supernatural stoicism. Although she’s a chronic insomniac, there’s no outward sign that she barely slept the night before, or that she suffers relentless pain from a dozen back surgeries. She’s laser-focused on splitting volunteers into release teams, her soft Kentucky accent lending a certain charm to her instructions. She obviously cares for the people around her (she often spends the wee hours making ice cream, with olive oil and other unusual ingredients, that she sends home with volunteers and staff). Still, there’s no question that the birds are her top priority. Once, while following a flock of exotic parakeets in her Chevy Suburban, she turned the wrong way on a single-lane dirt road and forced an oncoming car to veer to the side. “There was,” she recalled, “no other way to go.”

On this November day, there was nothing to do but wait. The time was drawing near to release the captives. But the previous night the hundreds-strong flock of Amazons had inexplicably roosted a mile away. Now, as the sun sank, there was no sign of the raucous crowd returning, and Durham had no Plan B if the birds failed to show up.

“We call this the Durham-Bridwell petting zoo,” Durham says of their sprawling two-story home, which sits on 1.8 acres at the end of a cul-de-sac. A couple of goats chew vacantly in their pen next to enclosures for ducks and geese, and a man-made stream feeds a 10,000-gallon pond where koi and rescued turtles swim lazy laps. Inside, a Bantam rooster undertakes self-appointed patrol duty, and three French bulldogs lounge on a leather couch. But the parrots clearly rule this roost. Bridwell, 43, a contractor who jokes that he can’t say no to his wife, converted the entire main floor of the house to a rehab center, complete with exam table, microscope, and stations for fledgling feeding. He also built an enormous enclosed aviary that holds about 50 parrots and parakeets. There are always dozens of volunteers about, cutting up mounds of fresh produce and cleaning out cages amid the cheerful barking, squawking chaos that’s occasionally punctuated by curses from the couple’s own potty-mouthed pet parrots. To Durham, it’s domestic bliss.

Durham first brought parrots home in 2007, when she’d been volunteering at Project Wildlife in San Diego for two years. She started that gig to get herself out of the house after her back surgeries (necessary to address years of impact from horse jumping and gymnastics). Word quickly spread. “These little green birds seemed to just keep falling from the sky and landing right in front of me,” says Durham, who officially launched SoCal Parrot in 2011 with the intention of releasing any birds fit enough to return to the wild. An encounter with a power line blew the feathers off a Lilac-crowned Parrot called Sparky (they’ve since grown back). Someone shot a Double Yellow-headed Parrot last summer with a pellet gun, shattering her wing. Figgy, another Lilac-crowned, was trapped and brought in after she was spotted in a Northern California neighborhood attempting to cozy up to some inhospitable crows.

SoCal’s sprawling aviary has been a godsend, says veterinarian Jeff Jenkins, who runs the Avian Exotic Hospital in San Diego. “We patch up [naturalized parrots], but to keep a bird until it can go back in the wild is a problem for us,” he says. “That’s why SoCal Parrot is so valuable.”

Accounts of parrots thriving in North American cities date back to the late 1950s. The birds, including the thousands of naturalized individuals from 13 species living in San Diego, Los Angeles, and Orange County, are widely considered to be remnants of the exotic avian trade, descendants of birds smuggled or imported years ago from their native Mexico, Central and South America, and India. Until the passage of the Wild Bird Conservation Act in 1992, the United States was the largest importer of exotic birds (a trade that’s since gone underground here). Some of those exotics escaped, were released accidentally, or were intentionally set free by overwhelmed owners or smugglers looking to avoid punishment, says Kimball Garrett, an ornithologist at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. “My pet peeve,” he says, “is hearing people claim that parrots in Southern California flew here or were blown in by storms.”

Durham points out that while populations of such psittacines as the Lilac-crowned Parrot and the Red-masked Parakeet are thriving in the United States, their wild relatives in their native ranges are in trouble, due largely to the pet trade and deforestation. “We could be the future of these species,” Durham says. “They’ve figured out a way to survive despite all the odds stacked against them.”

That includes a lack of legal protections, aside from a Fish and Wildlife Service proviso that prohibits the disruption of nesting birds (except chickens). Both the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Wild Bird Conservation Act protect wild parrots from international trade, but the birds aren’t covered under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

In early 2013 Durham contacted federal and state wildlife agencies to discuss a possible release. The agencies initially balked. “In a strict reading of Title 14, releasing parrots into the wild is illegal,” California Fish and Wildlife public information officer Andrew Hughan told Audubon.

The state’s main concern was potential damage to native flora and fauna (never mind, said Durham, that rehab groups regularly let loose patched-up House Sparrows, European Starlings, and Rock Pigeons—all introduced species).

“They said we could keep the birds, adopt them out as pets, take them back to Mexico, or have them euthanized,” says Durham, who was outraged. “These are not pets. These are wild birds, and they don’t do well in captivity.”

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the parrots pose little, if any, threat to native birds and plants, says James Gilardi, executive director of the World Parrot Trust, an international conservation group that has a Florida branch. “They’re living on, and in, nonnative ornamental and street trees in developed areas,” says Gilardi, including walnut, fig, palm, and eucalyptus trees (where they nest).

Durham wrote, emailed, and called various state and federal wildlife agencies for a year before they came around to her way of thinking. “If the people at SoCal Parrot feel it’s best for the animals to be released into the wild, and that their quality of life will be better,” Hughan said, “then we will not enforce [the law], and we wish them the best of luck.” The only stipulation was that no Monk Parakeets could be let loose (the birds are banned as agricultural pests).

Other parrot rehab centers are watching closely to see both how the birds reintegrate and whether wildlife agencies crack down on SoCal Parrot after all. “The regulatory system is very complex,” says Michelle Yesney, CEO of Mickaboo Companion Bird Rescue, which serves most of Northern California. “I’m a little uneasy about this, but I’m optimistic that it can become an acceptable practice.”

That is, of course, assuming the birds adjust to the wild again after their time in captivity.

Outside the courthouse, the harsh cackle of Amazons finally cuts through the hum of traffic. Six bright-green parrots circled overhead, then settled on some power lines a block away. Good enough. Durham wouldn’t wait for more of the flock to appear. A volunteer asked if it wasn’t too soon. “Don’t worry,” Durham said, calmly pulling on her leather gloves. “They can all fly.”

She carefully removed a Red-crowned Parrot from a pet carrier. It protested mightily while she held it firmly, allowed its eyes to adjust, and let go. The parrot noisily gained altitude, circled, and then melted into the foliage of a eucalyptus tree. The Amazons on the power lines screeched at the spectacle but stayed put. One by one, Durham set her captives free.

Suddenly, after the final bird had settled in, about 500 Amazons dropped out of the sky. They swooped, calling to one another in a deafening chatter before settling in the pines and eucalyptus, transforming El Cajon into an urban jungle. As the sky went fully dark, every parrot fell silent. The birds—rehabbed and otherwise—were in for the night. “None of this has really hit me yet,” Durham said, walking back to her car, “but I’m sure the tears will come later.”

As of this spring, all 18 Amazons were still with the courtyard flock (each bird has an ID chip). Durham had also released another batch of birds, eight parakeets, elsewhere in San Diego; only one, it seems, didn’t have a taste for the wild. That Mitred Parakeet landed at the San Diego Zoo—in the condor flight enclosure exhibit, of all places—a few days after it was set free, and is now back at the SoCal Parrot aviary. All of them, it seems, have made their way home.

29,"The Yellow-headed Picathartes cave near dusk. Photo: Noah Strycker

June 27, 2015, Kumasi, Ghana — My most-wanted bird in Ghana on this trip was the Yellow-headed Picathartes (also known as the White-necked Rockfowl)—a bizarre and rare species of West African tropical forests. The picathartes is the size of a chicken but slimmer, with a colorful, smooth-looking head and a beady black eye. It puts its nest underneath large rock overhangs and in caves, and spends its days skulking around the nearby forest, sometimes following ant swarms. In the rest of the world there is nothing like it.

Kalu knew a good picathartes stakeout and we made a special trip this afternoon. In 2007, a couple of birders in Ghana were looking for Yellow-headed Picathartes locations and canvassed some remote villages asking if anyone had seen the bird. A man named Samson in a village called Bonkro said he could find one, and, sure enough, was able to lead birders right to it (he has since discovered a couple more, too, in less accessible places). He was waiting when we arrived in Bonkro today and accompanied Kalu and me up a machete trail through the forest.

After about a half mile, we crested a ridge and reached a large rock which was undercut at its base. There, on the inward-sloping rock wall, was a cup-shaped nest made of dried mud. The picathartes sleeps in its nest each night throughout the year, even when it doesn’t have eggs or chicks to attend, so we sat down and waited for the strange bird to return to roost.

Noah’s view of the Yellow-headed Picathartes as it returns to its roost.

Just as dusk settled, the Yellow-headed Picathartes hopped quietly out of the vegetation and, moving deliberately, made its way toward the nest. A second bird, perhaps its mate, showed up, giving us fantastic views. We watched them for several minutes then, not wanting to disturb their sleep or get ourselves stuck in the forest after dark, slipped back down to the village. A perfect punctuation to another productive day!

30,"For me, this year is definitely about Southern Africa. In September my partner and I will be heading out to the Western Cape of South Africa to observe the habitats of the high altitude members of the Protea family. We want to better understand their cultivation here in the UK and hopefully be able to inform their future ex-situ conservation.

Back in the early 1800’s, growing Protea and many other southern African plants was highly fashionable: now it seems this trend has come full circle. While wandering around the RHS Chelsea flower show this year it was obvious that it is the year of Southern Africa for others too.

Australian garden designer Charlie Albone used the king protea (Protea cynaroides), the national flower of South Africa, in his show garden The Time In Between, but received much criticism over this plant’s supposed lack of hardiness. I have grown P. cynaroides in my own garden in Wales now for more than four years. It likes full sun and poor, acid (phosphate-free) soil, and will flower outside in Britain as far north as Logan Botanic Garden in Scotland. Although the king of flowers, it isn’t a softy and will bounce back from its rootstock even after a good frost.

In Matthew Keightley’s Sentebale - Hope In Vulnerability garden there was a fair selection of southern African delights too. This time, the garden’s provenance was that of Lesotho, a mountain kingdom surrounded on all sides by South Africa. The socio-economic problems Lesotho faces mean that much of its amazing flora is highly threatened in its wild state. The crown-like spiral aloe (Aloe polyphylla), comes from high altitude regions of Lesotho where winter temperatures regularly dip well below freezing. At Chelsea, this plant was to be found on show inside the Grand Pavilion at Trewidden Nursery’s walk-through display, but I know of a large plant of this growing outside, unprotected, in Luton, and my own spiral aloe plant has happily seen minus 6C in a pot without flinching.

Of course, it was in the Grand Pavilion where I found many more South African jewels. Agapanthus and Tulbaghia from Hoyland Plant Centre, Restios from Kelnan Plants and the exhibit by the South African National Biodiversity Institute at Kirstenbosch Botanic Gardens. It is incredible that they managed to finish the display on time, and get a silver medal, given that they were still waiting for their flowers to be released from customs just hours before they were due to be complete.

For me, the truly royal guest at this year’s RHS Chelsea went to Drossera regia, The king sundew, on Hewitt-Cooper Carnivorous Plants’ display. Found only in one valley just outside Cape Town, about 900 metres above sea level, this was possibly the rarest plant at the show this year. Only known from two populations, one of which is probably now extinct due to its habitat becoming overgrown, this Drossera (it means dew-covered) is reduced to just 50 or so known wild individuals. The king sundew is comparatively easy to grow in the UK, but best suited to a greenhouse. This is the one plant I would have happily brought home from this year’s Chelsea.

I left London to head back to North Wales well before the Queen arrived at the showground. Chelsea this year has thoroughly whet my appetite for the aristocratic plants I will see in South Africa, one of the most botanically rich areas of the world, this autumn.

In Matthew Keightley’s Sentebale - Hope In Vulnerability garden there was a fair selection of southern African delights too. This time, the garden’s provenance was that of Lesotho, a mountain kingdom surrounded on all sides by South Africa. The socio-economic problems Lesotho faces mean that much of its amazing flora is highly threatened in its wild state. The crown-like spiral aloe (Aloe polyphylla), comes from high altitude regions of Lesotho where winter temperatures regularly dip well below freezing. At Chelsea, this plant was to be found on show inside the Grand Pavilion at Trewidden Nursery’s walk-through display, but I know of a large plant of this growing outside, unprotected, in Luton, and my own spiral aloe plant has happily seen minus 6C in a pot without flinching.

Of course, it was in the Grand Pavilion where I found many more South African jewels. Agapanthus and Tulbaghia from Hoyland Plant Centre, Restios from Kelnan Plants and the exhibit by the South African National Biodiversity Institute at Kirstenbosch Botanic Gardens. It is incredible that they managed to finish the display on time, and get a silver medal, given that they were still waiting for their flowers to be released from customs just hours before they were due to be complete.

For me, the truly royal guest at this year’s RHS Chelsea went to Drossera regia, The king sundew, on Hewitt-Cooper Carnivorous Plants’ display. Found only in one valley just outside Cape Town, about 900 metres above sea level, this was possibly the rarest plant at the show this year. Only known from two populations, one of which is probably now extinct due to its habitat becoming overgrown, this Drossera (it means dew-covered) is reduced to just 50 or so known wild individuals. The king sundew is comparatively easy to grow in the UK, but best suited to a greenhouse. This is the one plant I would have happily brought home from this year’s Chelsea.

I left London to head back to North Wales well before the Queen arrived at the showground. Chelsea this year has thoroughly whet my appetite for the aristocratic plants I will see in South Africa, one of the most botanically rich areas of the world, this autumn.

31,"Boa constrictors were long thought to kill their prey by suffocation, slowly squeezing the life out one ragged breath at a time.

But a new study reveals that these big, non-venomous serpents, found in tropical Central and South America, subdue their quarry with a much quicker method: Cutting off their blood supply.

When a boa tightens its body around its prey, it throws off the finely tuned plumbing of the victim's circulatory system. Arterial pressures plummet, venous pressures soar, and blood vessels begin to close. ( Read how snakes know when to stop squeezing their prey .)

""The heart literally doesn't have enough strength to push against the pressure,"" says study leader Scott Boback , a vertebrate ecologist at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.

Most animals can actually survive a relatively long time without breathing: Think about drowning people who are later resuscitated, he says. But the same isn't true for a body without a heartbeat.

If executed perfectly, the powerful squeeze causes the animal to pass out within a matter of seconds. Death follows soon after.

Snakes on a Vein

To better understand the snakes' constriction mechanism, Boback and his colleagues at Dickinson anesthetized lab rats and then rigged the animals with various instruments.

Vascular catheters measured blood pressure, for instance, while electrodes secured within the rats' chest cavities provided information about the heart's electrical activity. (Also see ""Pictures: How a Python Can Swallow a Crocodile."")

Then they fed the outfitted rats to captive boa constrictors and measured what happened to the lab rats. Surprisingly, the pressures at which the snakes cinched against the rats weren't all that remarkable. But then again, they don't need to be.

""A boa constricting a small rat is generating the kind of pressure that would stop the blood flow in your arm,"" says Boback, whose study appears July 22 in the Journal of Experimental Biology.

But even this light pressure, when applied to a rat's torso, makes its system goes haywire, the team discovered. (See ""Giant Python Meals That Went Bust."")

Once blood flow ceases, organs with high metabolic rates—such as the brain, the liver, and the heart itself—begin to shut down. Doctors call this ischemia .

Snakes call it lunch.

An Evolutionary Advantage

The team theorizes that killing by circulatory arrest has given all constricting snakes—which includes pythons and anacondas —an evolutionary advantage. The quicker the snakes can disable their prey, the lower the chance the predator will get hurt in the process.

""That absolutely makes sense,"" says Paul Rosolie , a conservationist who has spent the last decade working with anacondas.

Think about other animals living alongside boa constrictors in tropical rain forests , says Rosolie: They have teeth, hooves, and claws capable of kicking and ripping. But a snake just has a mouth—making it extremely vulnerable. ( Watch a video of an anaconda taking down its prey .)

""Almost every time an anaconda takes something down, it's putting its face on that animal,"" says Rosolie, who wasn't involved in the new research.

""If it doesn't get the attack exactly right, something big like a capybara can chew right through the body of an anaconda.""

Ectotherm's Revenge

As interesting as his revelation is, Boback says there's still much we don't know.

For instance, there's evidence that boa constrictors have a tougher time killing ectotherms, animals such as lizards and snakes that rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures.

During a recent expedition to Honduras , for instance, Boback and several other scientists observed a boa constrictor attacking a spinytail iguana . After the snake constricted its prey for an hour, the team collected both animals—assuming the iguana was dead—and went to bed.

In the morning, they were surprised to discover the animals at either end of the observation tank, with the iguana alive and well. (Also see "" Freshly Eaten Snake Makes Amazing Escape—Find Out How ."")

""We have no idea what was going on,"" says Boback, ""but [the iguana] seemed totally fine.""

The Mojave Project is an experimental transmedia documentary by Kim Stringfellow exploring the physical, geological and cultural landscape of the Mojave Desert. The Mojave Project reconsiders and establishes multiple ways in which to interpret this unique and complex landscape, through association and connection of seemingly unrelated sites, themes, and subjects thus creating a speculative and immersive experience for its audience.

The desert tortoise has been under siege by humans long before the Mojave Desert's militarized and suburbanized landscape began to take shape here. It is known that several ancestral tribes in the Southwest consumed them, and even if they chose not to they managed to use their various parts -- the carapace or upper shell, the plastron or lower shell for bowls, scrapers and other household effects. All of the Mojave tribal groups transformed tortoise shells into rattles and drums for ceremonial use. Other tribes, such as the Chemehuevi, kept them as pets while at the same time venerating tortoises as a mythological symbol of ""patience, stamina for survival, and courage in hopeless situations.""1 In many world cultures, including several indigenous tribes of North America, the universe is depicted on the back of a turtle or ""cosmic"" tortoise. Even while sacrificed for sustenance, utilitarian or ritualistic purposes, none of these indigenous uses come anywhere close to modern anthropogenic attacks on this environmentally vulnerable indicator species.

Though not so popular as a menu item today as in the past, tortoises remain a culturally significant symbol. In Jessica Speart's 1998 fictional ""eco-mystery"" ""Tortoise Soup,"" the story's main protagonist, a female U.S. Fish and Wildlife officer, is transferred out to the Mojave to unravel why 350 endangered desert tortoises have suddenly disappeared from a federal research site in Nevada. Earlier popular representations of the tortoise (not necessarily the desert tortoise) include Disney's 1934 animated fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" The moody instrumental band Tortoise states on their Twitter page: ""the Thrill Jockey band from Chicago, not the land-dwelling reptile."" In neighboring Twentynine Palms we even have a new Indian casino named after them.

Turtles and tortoises are also frequently featured in art. When Robert Rauschenberg and Lucinda Childs staged ""Spring Training"" in 1965, the performance involved 30 roving desert tortoises with flashlights taped to their backs. In August 2014, outraged online petitioners called on the Aspen Art Museum to shut down a site-specific installation by artist Cal Guo-Qiang titled ""Moving Ghost Town,"" involving three rescued African spurred tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata) -- each with video-displaying iPads temporarily mounted on their backs with silicon. The conceptual artwork displayed film footage of three nearby ghost towns captured previously by the roaming tortoises named Big Bertha, Gracie Pink Star, and Whale Wanderer. Although the museum's website states that the project was conducted in close consultation with the Turtle Conservancy and a local veterinarian who monitored the tortoises on a weekly basis, animal rights activists and others expressed outrage that the tortoises were being used as ""artist supplies."" (Disclosure: I signed the petition.) The website goes on to mention that ""In Chinese symbolism, tortoises represent creation, time, longevity, and wisdom; they are associated with the North direction -- that of death and rebirth... [and] are seen as supernatural spirits."" The Aspen exhibit closed earlier than expected when acting veterinarian Dr. Elizabeth Kremzier decided that unseasonable inclement weather would harm them. The museum insisted in a press release that the decision was not due to outside pressure. The concerns expressed by the public for these tortoises illustrate how deeply humans often react to the welfare of these ancient and venerated creatures.

Found slightly above sea level on an elevation of about 4,200 feet in several vegetation types of the Mojave, Colorado and Sonoran deserts, desert tortoises of the American Southwest are now determined to be of two distinct species with Gopherus agassizii residing north and west of the Colorado River, whereas Gopherus morafkai is located east and south of it. As a flagship species, the current status of their populations tells us a lot about the health of the arid ecosystems. During the 1970s, hundreds of desert tortoises could be found within a square mile in some Mojave and Colorado desert habitats -- today one may find only a few dozen individuals in the same areas. Understandably, the desert tortoise has been listed as a federally threatened species since 1990.

Tortoises are commonly confused with the turtle but unlike their reptilian cousin they are a terrestrial being tied to land rather than water. When fully mature desert tortoises weigh 7 to 15 pounds and are 7 to 15 inches in length. Although it is difficult for an untrained eye to tell the gender of a particular tortoise, males are typically larger, their tale is slightly longer, and their plastrons are concave in shape compared to that of females. Breeding males also sport pronounced chin glands that secrete a sticky substance and large adult males have substantially larger and curved gular horns below their chins. Coloration ranges from greenish-tan to dark brown, and their high-dome shells are covered with a pattern of seemingly impenetrably nested plates or ""scutes"" that seem to suggest infinity in their repetitive design. This, along with ancient leathery skin and a pointy curved beak, suggests their prehistoric origins -- the turtle form dating back some 200 to 220 million years in the late Triassic Period. Wild desert tortoises that reach maturity may live between 25 to 50 years of age and even longer. Some captive individuals have been said to reach 100.

Typical individual home ranges cover between 25 to 130 acres, although some desert tortoises have been known to travel up to a mile away from their primary living area. Desert tortoises will dig their burrows, formed by the shape of their body, in a variety of stable, penetrable but undisturbed soils located in sandy washes to rocky foothills, using their powerful forelimbs and toenails to excavate. Known for thriving within extreme environments -- including those with recorded ground temperatures from below zero to 130 degrees Fahrenheit -- desert tortoises understandably spend up to 98 percent of their lives underground. Their robust burrows may in turn support a communal community of up to 30 species, including snakes, lizards, insects, birds, rats, mice, rabbits and foxes and, of course, other fellow tortoises -- up to 20 or more in some areas. Tortoises additionally rely on a number of temporary shallow holdouts and desert ground cover such as creosote bushes to escape the heat of the sun and to hide from numerous predators. Tortoises know their home turf intimately, having memorized various landmarks, food and water sources and other tortoise burrows, especially those of the opposite sex and often will attempt to travel back to their home territory -- no matter how far away it lies if translocated or moved.

Desert tortoises are most active from March through September, spending spring and early summer months foraging on a herbaceous diet of native annual grasses, seasonal wildflowers, forbs, various succulents and cacti flowers spotted through their perfect color eyesight. From late fall into winter they retreat and brumate deep within their winter dens. To survive through the hotter summer months with no supplemental water other than what is provided from vegetation or sporadic summer rains, the desert tortoise has remarkably evolved to concentrate and store urine for months on end in a large bladder. Additionally, it copes with the oppressive heat by entering into a state of aestivation or dormancy after the moisture-laden springtime bloom has long dried up. Sensing an impending thunderstorm, a dormant tortoise will awaken and emerge from its den and commence to dig or revisit a shallow rain catchment where it can simultaneously drink up water and eliminate its stockpiled viscous and concentrated urine in an act that strikes me as rather liberating. This necessary procedure allows the tortoise to flush toxins from the blood and eliminate concentrated salts and nitrogenous wastes from the bladder, while gaining up to 40 percent of fresh water through drinking. Because their overall survival is directly tied to their propensity to store urine during the dry summer months, a startled tortoise may void its bladder as a defensive mechanism, succumb to dehydration and die, so it is advised not to pick them up and move them if encountered in the wild.

Sexual encounters of desert tortoises begin as early as 12 years of age, although on average females begin laying eggs between 15 and 20 years. Males will mate with females when encountered during spring and autumn. Males compete with other males through a variety of aggressive behaviors, including head bobbing, biting or striking at a competing suitor's up-curved gular horn, which is an extension of its plastron. Courting males will similarly try to impress or simply bully a female by continually circling her and blocking her path, snapping at and biting her before attempting to mount her. Regardless of his aggressive advances, it has been observed that some female desert tortoises do exhibit choice during selection of a mate and it seems size does matter. Interestingly, the testosterone level of the male desert tortoise during mating season is higher than any vertebrate species, including humans. During coupling, tortoises have been observed vocalizing through extended grunts and ""moaning,"" and the slapping movements of shell upon shell have been described as sounding like a beating drum. The sound designer for ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) revealed that the grunts of the clever velociraptors were created from recordings of tortoises having sex at a well-known marine park.

Once a female tortoise has mated she may rather conveniently store her donor's sperm over multiple years -- up to 15 in one instance -- and reproduce up to four years after initially mating. Females lay up to three clutches of 2 to 14 eggs per year depending on physical size and age. Nesting occurs in a shallow excavated dirt depression that may or may not be guarded by the female. Once hatched, she ceases to defend the nest. Drought and seasonal food availability greatly affects egg production and viability. Temperature seems to affect hatchling gender. Appearing as adorable diminutive versions of their parents, the hatchlings normally emerge after about 90 to 120 days, two inches in length with an intact yolk plug that supplies nourishment throughout the coming months. Although they are born mobile from the start, these extremely assailable hatchlings are susceptible to predation in that their shells take about five years to harden, making them a fairly easy target and quick meal -- a very low number will be lucky enough to reach that age if at all. Those who do reach maturity continue to be prey to an array of seemingly ""natural"" predators like ravens, eagles, coyotes, dogs, kit foxes, badgers, bobcats, gila monsters, roadrunners and other threats. However, mortality due to direct or indirect human-related activities remains at the top of the list.

Since 1939, it has been illegal to purchase or sell Gopherus agassizii in California. In the years leading up to the law being enacted, scores of desert tortoises were collected throughout the Mojave and shipped live to restaurants for human consumption or to the pet trade. Highway travelers could purchase tortoises as souvenirs from roadside attractions and gas stations. With the awareness that wild desert tortoises were becoming increasingly scarce, the earlier law was expanded in 1961 to protect them from ""needlessly harming, taking, or shooting any projectile.""

During research conducted for ""Jackrabbit Homestead,"" I interviewed one woman whose favorite desert activity was locating and collecting desert tortoises that were kept as ""pets"" in a pen outside her family's 1950s era cabin located in Twentynine Palms. Occasionally, she and her siblings would ""race"" them against one another with competitor numbers painted across each tortoise shell. In 2013, it was ""roughly estimated"" that in the Las Vegas Valley alone there are up to 150,000 pet tortoises in captivity, legally cared for by ""custodians"" as ownership of a threatened species is illegal.2 Because desert tortoises breed very well in captivity (to the detriment of the wild population) the Nevada Wildlife Commission enacted a law in 2013 allowing the adoption of only a single tortoise per household.

Indeed, by the 1980s many areas of the Mojave showed a 90 percent decline in overall wild populations. Hardest hit is the Western Mojave where human development and its associated activities of urbanization, mining, agriculture, livestock grazing, tract home subdivisions, military land use, industrial solar/wind installations and recreational spillover from greater Los Angeles is rampant. Today, Gopherus agassizii is considered to be completely absent from the Victorville, Palmdale and Lancaster areas, other than those that are pets living captive in somebody's backyard. Notably some of the most prized habitat for desert tortoises lies in military controlled areas of the Mojave, lands within Edwards Air Force Base, the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center and the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin where extensive ground maneuvers have most likely obliterated much of the shrub cover. One study found ""of sixty-two tortoises found on survey transects at Fort Irwin in 1989, forty-four were dead, and half the carcasses were found in tank tracks.""3 Today, all of these military installations currently sponsor onsite desert tortoise conservation programs, due to their federally protected listing.

The person perhaps most credited with gaining protection of Gopherus agassizii under the federal Endangered Species Act is Dr. Kristin Berry, a research biologist/ecologist specializing in the species, formerly employed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and currently with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) since 1997. Dr. Berry has been studying and championing desert tortoises since the beginning of her career in 1971. Two years into her research, Dr. Berry along with a group of concerned scientists helped designate public land in the northwestern Mojave for the Desert Tortoise Natural Area in 1973.

Dr. Berry is a slight, pretty woman with a fair-complexion. On first impression it is hard to imagine her spending endless hours in the field studying a creature that resides in some of the hottest terrain in the world. Now in her early 70s, she continues to do a fair amount of field research, but spends the vast majority of her time analyzing data and writing reports and manuscripts for publication in the air-conditioned field office of USGS in Riverside or as an honored speaker for various outreach events. Over 30 years ago, Dr. Berry began a long-term study of tortoise populations by establishing over a dozen study plots throughout the Mojave and Colorado deserts of California. About half of the plots had a sufficient number of tortoises in the 1970s and early 1980s to use for long-term monitoring. These study areas have been invaluable in determining how tortoise populations, habitats and human uses have changed over time.

She is the author and co-author of numerous short and long-term research field studies and reports, including a largely ignored 1994 Recovery Plan which many environmentalists contend would have stopped Gopherus agassizii's current population decline if its recommendations had been followed and implemented 20 years ago. Many in the conservation community consider Dr. Berry to be the authority on Gopherus agassizii. She is arguably its most persistent advocate as her efforts have kept the plight of desert tortoises in the public eye for over 40 years now.

Raised in the Western Mojave as the daughter of a physicist/mathematics expert employed at the Navy base at China Lake she developed a love for the desert at an early age, especially the reptiles of the region. After completing her master's degree at UCLA and a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley she began her long career in conservation biology. Her contributions to the California Desert Plan completed in 1980 helped lay the groundwork for an emergency California state listing of Gopherus agassizii as threatened in 1989 and its consequent federal listing in 1990 -- a contested move that temporarily shut down a glut of proposed suburban housing projects along the fringes of Las Vegas as well as the infamous 150-mile open desert Barstow-to-Vegas motorcycle race that same year.

Dr. Berry's career has not been without controversy: David Darlington's 1996 book ""The Mojave"" asserted that during her tenure with the BLM she tightly controlled data pertaining to Gopherus agassizii to protect the desert tortoise. Reading through several pages of unflattering comments from unidentified former colleagues I was struck by the fact that many, if not all, of these disgruntled voices were male, and I'm guessing not particularly happy that a highly focused and forceful woman was in charge. Perhaps Dr. Berry was simply granted study and monitoring funds that her detractors thought they should receive? Indeed, it was largely unheard of for the BLM to hire female wildlife biologists in this formally male-dominated agency during the 1970s and Dr. Berry was its first. The BLM's often conflicted multi-use agenda of satisfying all desert stakeholders at once further complicates many desert conservation issues.

It is unlawful to touch, harm, harass or collect a wild desert tortoise, and doing so will cost you up to $50,000 and up to one year in jail if caught. This hasn't deterred a few pathetic individuals from using tortoises for target practice. A study published in 1986 by Dr. Berry reported that between 1976 and 1982, 14 percent of 635 carcasses found at 11 long-term monitoring plots were killed intentionally from gunshot wounds. In fact, it was not unusual for a defiant off-highway vehicle driver to purposely strike and kill them out of spite while riding. Dr. Berry shared in a 2015 interview how during those early years, one off-roader relished in telling her that ""he liked to hear them pop as he ran over them."" In contrast, another confided that after accidentally riding over one and killing it, he had decided afterwards to never participate in the activity again. Considering the tortoise's benign character it is difficult to grasp why someone could purposely direct so much anger towards these unthreatening and stoic creatures.

More often than not, tortoises are unintentionally run over or crushed after seeking shade under a parked car by drivers who forget to look under before driving off. Even if a desert tortoise is not harmed directly, the devastation that off-roading activities reap on tortoise habitats is proven to be overwhelmingly destructive -- burrows cave in trapping them inside, native plant food sources are crushed and shrub cover providing shade and protection is destroyed.

Regardless, if one empathizes with the plight of the desert tortoise or not, most can agree that degradation, destruction and fragmentation of habitat resulting from development, agriculture practices, wildfire and off-roading activities directly impacts them. Still, less obvious are the cumulative threats that humans support indirectly. These, along with the desert tortoise's slow rate of reproduction have contributed to Gopherus agassizii's rapid decline over the last 40 years. Indirect threats include well-intended releases of captive pet tortoises into wild areas, which appear to have been responsible for introducing various catastrophic infectious ailments, including an upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), to wild tortoise populations. Livestock, where present, trample and denude habitat while inadvertently introducing invasive plants, thereby overwhelming native vegetation. These non-native species do not provide the nutritional value of the indigenous plants they have replaced.

Consequently, a good portion of prime tortoise habitat throughout the Mojave has been damaged through domesticated ruminant introduction. The issue ignited the 2014 Cliven Bundy standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada when rancher Bundy -- who stopped paying grazing fees to the federal government in 1993, while continuing to illegally graze his cattle on public land -- refused to remove them from the Gold Butte area of southern Nevada. The BLM's planned roundup of his livestock backfired when armed militia groups and individuals showed up in support of Bundy, eventually forcing authorities to release 300 of his confiscated cattle back onto public land on April 12, 2014.4

Other threats include those human ""subsidized"" such as the common raven (Corvus corax) -- considered by many to be highly invasive due to their alarming growth rate -- up to 1,000 percent within the Mojave since the 1970s. Ravens thrive here because they make use of our water features, landfills, illegal dumps, trash, pet food left outdoors, and even road kill for reliable sources of sustenance. As we spread further across the desert, so do the raven's numbers. During the 1980s, Dr. Berry and her colleagues documented how ravens may methodically prey on young tortoises and contribute to high juvenile tortoise mortality rates. In one study alone, one single mated pair was found, over a four-year period, to have fed on about 250 juvenile tortoises whose pecked out shells were discovered at the base of the ravens' nest and roost -- a Joshua tree. Raven perches typically are fence or utility poles common throughout the desert. Current and recent government policy on raven predation of tortoises was developed as the result of a legal settlement with the Human Society of the U.S. more than 20 years ago. Evidence that a particular raven has recently killed more than one juvenile tortoise is necessary before the raven can be removed from the location.

As Las Vegas and other desert cities spread their suburban tentacles out into the undisturbed desert so disappears valued tortoise habitat. Gopherus agassizii's threatened status has ensured that any entity wishing to legally remove desert tortoises within an area slated for development must, in exchange, finance a costly mitigation effort to offset their displacement and loss of habitat. For example, developers wishing to build in Clark County, Nevada must pay a ""disturbance fee"" of $550 per acre (up to 145,000 acres) for private land and $836 per acre for public land development. The collected fees are used to offset costs of slated and active conservation projects. Other developers opt for translocation under professional supervision to ""complimentary"" sites purchased by them for this purpose.

Ever-expanding military bases, mining operations, and more recent massive renewable solar and wind projects sited in remote desert locations including BrightSource's Ivanpah Valley facility -- considered by biologists to be prized desert tortoise habitat -- have opted to relocate large numbers of desert tortoises at a huge cost. Many earlier attempts to translocate wild desert tortoises, including a poorly designed effort at Fort Irwin in 2008, resulted in deaths of hundreds of tortoises. Although techniques for translocating wild tortoises may have improved, those managing to survive live with the possibility that they may be moved again and again if the mitigation site is not properly protected well into the future.

In another twist of fate, the former 220-acre Desert Tortoise Conservation Center located in south Las Vegas shuttered its doors in 2014 because of dwindling local and federal funding. In operation for 23 years, this ""tortoise gulag"" was opened and funded through mitigation developer money with the intention to house displaced wild desert tortoises, but became overcrowded with surrendered pet tortoises early on, which do remarkably well in captivity but are often carriers of infectious diseases, making them unfit to release into the wild. Taking in nearly 1,000 animals annually, the facility's operational funding dropped to a trickle after the housing bubble burst in 2008. To complicate matters, many of the interned tortoises had developed the chronic and potentially fatal URTD, and thousands were consequently euthanized according to protocol. In later years, it was determined that tortoises could recover from and still carry the disease, so the mass killings were ended. By the time the facility closed its doors, it was estimated that more than 10,000 tortoises had been released into the wild at various federal land holdings, namely Nevada National Security Site and the large-scale translocation site near Jean, Nevada. It is not known how many of the released tortoises have or will survive this recent translocated fate.

Dr. Berry and many other desert tortoise experts are understandably skeptical on whether tortoises should be uprooted from within pristine, undeveloped lands, at least until long-term scientific studies indicate that a substantial portion of translocated tortoises can survive and become established in their new homes. She and other scientists were Independent Science Advisors for California's Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan in 2010. The Independent Science Advisors recommended that energy site development occur on previously disturbed lands, thereby avoiding new losses of desert lands. Unfortunately, that recommendation has not been followed. Justly, the concerned public backlash against the repeated proposals to site massive ""green"" solar energy projects in remote, undisturbed areas of the Mojave has gained momentum, especially with the public's awareness of numerous environmental impacts caused by these types of large-scale projects. It seems that a few of the corporations bankrolling these installations are looking for alternatives.

Ideally, intact habitat solely dedicated to the desert tortoise and the ecological web it is part of is the best management strategy for Gopherus agassizii. An example of one such sanctuary is the 25,000-acre Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (DTNA) located within the western Mojave near California City and managed by the BLM -- the area established between 1973 and 1980 with the help of Dr. Berry and her colleagues. This ""Area of Critical Environmental Concern"" had one of the highest densities of Gopherus agassizii per square mile with up 200 to 300 individual tortoises in some areas of the DTNA, until URTD spread across the western Mojave, taking many adults. Ravens have been responsible for inhibiting recovery by killing juveniles. However, although this site suffered catastrophic losses, a recent survey showed that tortoise densities are several-fold higher here than on adjacent federal land, designated as critical habitat for the tortoise. The fence around the DTNA has protected both tortoises and habitat from sheep grazing and off-highway vehicle recreation since 1980. The site is a two-hour drive from Los Angeles or Bakersfield. When planning a visit keep in mind that you are more likely to see active tortoises early in the day during the spring months. An array of other rich flora and fauna may be additionally viewed here too.

The Mojave Project is an experimental transmedia documentary by Kim Stringfellow exploring the physical, geological and cultural landscape of the Mojave Desert. The Mojave Project reconsiders and establishes multiple ways in which to interpret this unique and complex landscape, through association and connection of seemingly unrelated sites, themes, and subjects thus creating a speculative and immersive experience for its audience.

The desert tortoise has been under siege by humans long before the Mojave Desert's militarized and suburbanized landscape began to take shape here. It is known that several ancestral tribes in the Southwest consumed them, and even if they chose not to they managed to use their various parts -- the carapace or upper shell, the plastron or lower shell for bowls, scrapers and other household effects. All of the Mojave tribal groups transformed tortoise shells into rattles and drums for ceremonial use. Other tribes, such as the Chemehuevi, kept them as pets while at the same time venerating tortoises as a mythological symbol of ""patience, stamina for survival, and courage in hopeless situations.""1 In many world cultures, including several indigenous tribes of North America, the universe is depicted on the back of a turtle or ""cosmic"" tortoise. Even while sacrificed for sustenance, utilitarian or ritualistic purposes, none of these indigenous uses come anywhere close to modern anthropogenic attacks on this environmentally vulnerable indicator species.

Though not so popular as a menu item today as in the past, tortoises remain a culturally significant symbol. In Jessica Speart's 1998 fictional ""eco-mystery"" ""Tortoise Soup,"" the story's main protagonist, a female U.S. Fish and Wildlife officer, is transferred out to the Mojave to unravel why 350 endangered desert tortoises have suddenly disappeared from a federal research site in Nevada. Earlier popular representations of the tortoise (not necessarily the desert tortoise) include Disney's 1934 animated fable ""The Tortoise and the Hare."" The moody instrumental band Tortoise states on their Twitter page: ""the Thrill Jockey band from Chicago, not the land-dwelling reptile."" In neighboring Twentynine Palms we even have a new Indian casino named after them.

Turtles and tortoises are also frequently featured in art. When Robert Rauschenberg and Lucinda Childs staged ""Spring Training"" in 1965, the performance involved 30 roving desert tortoises with flashlights taped to their backs. In August 2014, outraged online petitioners called on the Aspen Art Museum to shut down a site-specific installation by artist Cal Guo-Qiang titled ""Moving Ghost Town,"" involving three rescued African spurred tortoises (Centrochelys sulcata) -- each with video-displaying iPads temporarily mounted on their backs with silicon. The conceptual artwork displayed film footage of three nearby ghost towns captured previously by the roaming tortoises named Big Bertha, Gracie Pink Star, and Whale Wanderer. Although the museum's website states that the project was conducted in close consultation with the Turtle Conservancy and a local veterinarian who monitored the tortoises on a weekly basis, animal rights activists and others expressed outrage that the tortoises were being used as ""artist supplies."" (Disclosure: I signed the petition.) The website goes on to mention that ""In Chinese symbolism, tortoises represent creation, time, longevity, and wisdom; they are associated with the North direction -- that of death and rebirth... [and] are seen as supernatural spirits."" The Aspen exhibit closed earlier than expected when acting veterinarian Dr. Elizabeth Kremzier decided that unseasonable inclement weather would harm them. The museum insisted in a press release that the decision was not due to outside pressure. The concerns expressed by the public for these tortoises illustrate how deeply humans often react to the welfare of these ancient and venerated creatures.

Found slightly above sea level on an elevation of about 4,200 feet in several vegetation types of the Mojave, Colorado and Sonoran deserts, desert tortoises of the American Southwest are now determined to be of two distinct species with Gopherus agassizii residing north and west of the Colorado River, whereas Gopherus morafkai is located east and south of it. As a flagship species, the current status of their populations tells us a lot about the health of the arid ecosystems. During the 1970s, hundreds of desert tortoises could be found within a square mile in some Mojave and Colorado desert habitats -- today one may find only a few dozen individuals in the same areas. Understandably, the desert tortoise has been listed as a federally threatened species since 1990.

Tortoises are commonly confused with the turtle but unlike their reptilian cousin they are a terrestrial being tied to land rather than water. When fully mature desert tortoises weigh 7 to 15 pounds and are 7 to 15 inches in length. Although it is difficult for an untrained eye to tell the gender of a particular tortoise, males are typically larger, their tale is slightly longer, and their plastrons are concave in shape compared to that of females. Breeding males also sport pronounced chin glands that secrete a sticky substance and large adult males have substantially larger and curved gular horns below their chins. Coloration ranges from greenish-tan to dark brown, and their high-dome shells are covered with a pattern of seemingly impenetrably nested plates or ""scutes"" that seem to suggest infinity in their repetitive design. This, along with ancient leathery skin and a pointy curved beak, suggests their prehistoric origins -- the turtle form dating back some 200 to 220 million years in the late Triassic Period. Wild desert tortoises that reach maturity may live between 25 to 50 years of age and even longer. Some captive individuals have been said to reach 100.

Typical individual home ranges cover between 25 to 130 acres, although some desert tortoises have been known to travel up to a mile away from their primary living area. Desert tortoises will dig their burrows, formed by the shape of their body, in a variety of stable, penetrable but undisturbed soils located in sandy washes to rocky foothills, using their powerful forelimbs and toenails to excavate. Known for thriving within extreme environments -- including those with recorded ground temperatures from below zero to 130 degrees Fahrenheit -- desert tortoises understandably spend up to 98 percent of their lives underground. Their robust burrows may in turn support a communal community of up to 30 species, including snakes, lizards, insects, birds, rats, mice, rabbits and foxes and, of course, other fellow tortoises -- up to 20 or more in some areas. Tortoises additionally rely on a number of temporary shallow holdouts and desert ground cover such as creosote bushes to escape the heat of the sun and to hide from numerous predators. Tortoises know their home turf intimately, having memorized various landmarks, food and water sources and other tortoise burrows, especially those of the opposite sex and often will attempt to travel back to their home territory -- no matter how far away it lies if translocated or moved.

Desert tortoises are most active from March through September, spending spring and early summer months foraging on a herbaceous diet of native annual grasses, seasonal wildflowers, forbs, various succulents and cacti flowers spotted through their perfect color eyesight. From late fall into winter they retreat and brumate deep within their winter dens. To survive through the hotter summer months with no supplemental water other than what is provided from vegetation or sporadic summer rains, the desert tortoise has remarkably evolved to concentrate and store urine for months on end in a large bladder. Additionally, it copes with the oppressive heat by entering into a state of aestivation or dormancy after the moisture-laden springtime bloom has long dried up. Sensing an impending thunderstorm, a dormant tortoise will awaken and emerge from its den and commence to dig or revisit a shallow rain catchment where it can simultaneously drink up water and eliminate its stockpiled viscous and concentrated urine in an act that strikes me as rather liberating. This necessary procedure allows the tortoise to flush toxins from the blood and eliminate concentrated salts and nitrogenous wastes from the bladder, while gaining up to 40 percent of fresh water through drinking. Because their overall survival is directly tied to their propensity to store urine during the dry summer months, a startled tortoise may void its bladder as a defensive mechanism, succumb to dehydration and die, so it is advised not to pick them up and move them if encountered in the wild.

Sexual encounters of desert tortoises begin as early as 12 years of age, although on average females begin laying eggs between 15 and 20 years. Males will mate with females when encountered during spring and autumn. Males compete with other males through a variety of aggressive behaviors, including head bobbing, biting or striking at a competing suitor's up-curved gular horn, which is an extension of its plastron. Courting males will similarly try to impress or simply bully a female by continually circling her and blocking her path, snapping at and biting her before attempting to mount her. Regardless of his aggressive advances, it has been observed that some female desert tortoises do exhibit choice during selection of a mate and it seems size does matter. Interestingly, the testosterone level of the male desert tortoise during mating season is higher than any vertebrate species, including humans. During coupling, tortoises have been observed vocalizing through extended grunts and ""moaning,"" and the slapping movements of shell upon shell have been described as sounding like a beating drum. The sound designer for ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) revealed that the grunts of the clever velociraptors were created from recordings of tortoises having sex at a well-known marine park.

Once a female tortoise has mated she may rather conveniently store her donor's sperm over multiple years -- up to 15 in one instance -- and reproduce up to four years after initially mating. Females lay up to three clutches of 2 to 14 eggs per year depending on physical size and age. Nesting occurs in a shallow excavated dirt depression that may or may not be guarded by the female. Once hatched, she ceases to defend the nest. Drought and seasonal food availability greatly affects egg production and viability. Temperature seems to affect hatchling gender. Appearing as adorable diminutive versions of their parents, the hatchlings normally emerge after about 90 to 120 days, two inches in length with an intact yolk plug that supplies nourishment throughout the coming months. Although they are born mobile from the start, these extremely assailable hatchlings are susceptible to predation in that their shells take about five years to harden, making them a fairly easy target and quick meal -- a very low number will be lucky enough to reach that age if at all. Those who do reach maturity continue to be prey to an array of seemingly ""natural"" predators like ravens, eagles, coyotes, dogs, kit foxes, badgers, bobcats, gila monsters, roadrunners and other threats. However, mortality due to direct or indirect human-related activities remains at the top of the list.

Since 1939, it has been illegal to purchase or sell Gopherus agassizii in California. In the years leading up to the law being enacted, scores of desert tortoises were collected throughout the Mojave and shipped live to restaurants for human consumption or to the pet trade. Highway travelers could purchase tortoises as souvenirs from roadside attractions and gas stations. With the awareness that wild desert tortoises were becoming increasingly scarce, the earlier law was expanded in 1961 to protect them from ""needlessly harming, taking, or shooting any projectile.""

During research conducted for ""Jackrabbit Homestead,"" I interviewed one woman whose favorite desert activity was locating and collecting desert tortoises that were kept as ""pets"" in a pen outside her family's 1950s era cabin located in Twentynine Palms. Occasionally, she and her siblings would ""race"" them against one another with competitor numbers painted across each tortoise shell. In 2013, it was ""roughly estimated"" that in the Las Vegas Valley alone there are up to 150,000 pet tortoises in captivity, legally cared for by ""custodians"" as ownership of a threatened species is illegal.2 Because desert tortoises breed very well in captivity (to the detriment of the wild population) the Nevada Wildlife Commission enacted a law in 2013 allowing the adoption of only a single tortoise per household.

Indeed, by the 1980s many areas of the Mojave showed a 90 percent decline in overall wild populations. Hardest hit is the Western Mojave where human development and its associated activities of urbanization, mining, agriculture, livestock grazing, tract home subdivisions, military land use, industrial solar/wind installations and recreational spillover from greater Los Angeles is rampant. Today, Gopherus agassizii is considered to be completely absent from the Victorville, Palmdale and Lancaster areas, other than those that are pets living captive in somebody's backyard. Notably some of the most prized habitat for desert tortoises lies in military controlled areas of the Mojave, lands within Edwards Air Force Base, the Twentynine Palms Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center and the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin where extensive ground maneuvers have most likely obliterated much of the shrub cover. One study found ""of sixty-two tortoises found on survey transects at Fort Irwin in 1989, forty-four were dead, and half the carcasses were found in tank tracks.""3 Today, all of these military installations currently sponsor onsite desert tortoise conservation programs, due to their federally protected listing.

The person perhaps most credited with gaining protection of Gopherus agassizii under the federal Endangered Species Act is Dr. Kristin Berry, a research biologist/ecologist specializing in the species, formerly employed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and currently with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) since 1997. Dr. Berry has been studying and championing desert tortoises since the beginning of her career in 1971. Two years into her research, Dr. Berry along with a group of concerned scientists helped designate public land in the northwestern Mojave for the Desert Tortoise Natural Area in 1973.

Dr. Berry is a slight, pretty woman with a fair-complexion. On first impression it is hard to imagine her spending endless hours in the field studying a creature that resides in some of the hottest terrain in the world. Now in her early 70s, she continues to do a fair amount of field research, but spends the vast majority of her time analyzing data and writing reports and manuscripts for publication in the air-conditioned field office of USGS in Riverside or as an honored speaker for various outreach events. Over 30 years ago, Dr. Berry began a long-term study of tortoise populations by establishing over a dozen study plots throughout the Mojave and Colorado deserts of California. About half of the plots had a sufficient number of tortoises in the 1970s and early 1980s to use for long-term monitoring. These study areas have been invaluable in determining how tortoise populations, habitats and human uses have changed over time.

She is the author and co-author of numerous short and long-term research field studies and reports, including a largely ignored 1994 Recovery Plan which many environmentalists contend would have stopped Gopherus agassizii's current population decline if its recommendations had been followed and implemented 20 years ago. Many in the conservation community consider Dr. Berry to be the authority on Gopherus agassizii. She is arguably its most persistent advocate as her efforts have kept the plight of desert tortoises in the public eye for over 40 years now.

Raised in the Western Mojave as the daughter of a physicist/mathematics expert employed at the Navy base at China Lake she developed a love for the desert at an early age, especially the reptiles of the region. After completing her master's degree at UCLA and a Ph.D. from UC Berkeley she began her long career in conservation biology. Her contributions to the California Desert Plan completed in 1980 helped lay the groundwork for an emergency California state listing of Gopherus agassizii as threatened in 1989 and its consequent federal listing in 1990 -- a contested move that temporarily shut down a glut of proposed suburban housing projects along the fringes of Las Vegas as well as the infamous 150-mile open desert Barstow-to-Vegas motorcycle race that same year.

Dr. Berry's career has not been without controversy: David Darlington's 1996 book ""The Mojave"" asserted that during her tenure with the BLM she tightly controlled data pertaining to Gopherus agassizii to protect the desert tortoise. Reading through several pages of unflattering comments from unidentified former colleagues I was struck by the fact that many, if not all, of these disgruntled voices were male, and I'm guessing not particularly happy that a highly focused and forceful woman was in charge. Perhaps Dr. Berry was simply granted study and monitoring funds that her detractors thought they should receive? Indeed, it was largely unheard of for the BLM to hire female wildlife biologists in this formally male-dominated agency during the 1970s and Dr. Berry was its first. The BLM's often conflicted multi-use agenda of satisfying all desert stakeholders at once further complicates many desert conservation issues.

It is unlawful to touch, harm, harass or collect a wild desert tortoise, and doing so will cost you up to $50,000 and up to one year in jail if caught. This hasn't deterred a few pathetic individuals from using tortoises for target practice. A study published in 1986 by Dr. Berry reported that between 1976 and 1982, 14 percent of 635 carcasses found at 11 long-term monitoring plots were killed intentionally from gunshot wounds. In fact, it was not unusual for a defiant off-highway vehicle driver to purposely strike and kill them out of spite while riding. Dr. Berry shared in a 2015 interview how during those early years, one off-roader relished in telling her that ""he liked to hear them pop as he ran over them."" In contrast, another confided that after accidentally riding over one and killing it, he had decided afterwards to never participate in the activity again. Considering the tortoise's benign character it is difficult to grasp why someone could purposely direct so much anger towards these unthreatening and stoic creatures.

More often than not, tortoises are unintentionally run over or crushed after seeking shade under a parked car by drivers who forget to look under before driving off. Even if a desert tortoise is not harmed directly, the devastation that off-roading activities reap on tortoise habitats is proven to be overwhelmingly destructive -- burrows cave in trapping them inside, native plant food sources are crushed and shrub cover providing shade and protection is destroyed.

Regardless, if one empathizes with the plight of the desert tortoise or not, most can agree that degradation, destruction and fragmentation of habitat resulting from development, agriculture practices, wildfire and off-roading activities directly impacts them. Still, less obvious are the cumulative threats that humans support indirectly. These, along with the desert tortoise's slow rate of reproduction have contributed to Gopherus agassizii's rapid decline over the last 40 years. Indirect threats include well-intended releases of captive pet tortoises into wild areas, which appear to have been responsible for introducing various catastrophic infectious ailments, including an upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), to wild tortoise populations. Livestock, where present, trample and denude habitat while inadvertently introducing invasive plants, thereby overwhelming native vegetation. These non-native species do not provide the nutritional value of the indigenous plants they have replaced.

Consequently, a good portion of prime tortoise habitat throughout the Mojave has been damaged through domesticated ruminant introduction. The issue ignited the 2014 Cliven Bundy standoff in Bunkerville, Nevada when rancher Bundy -- who stopped paying grazing fees to the federal government in 1993, while continuing to illegally graze his cattle on public land -- refused to remove them from the Gold Butte area of southern Nevada. The BLM's planned roundup of his livestock backfired when armed militia groups and individuals showed up in support of Bundy, eventually forcing authorities to release 300 of his confiscated cattle back onto public land on April 12, 2014.4

Other threats include those human ""subsidized"" such as the common raven (Corvus corax) -- considered by many to be highly invasive due to their alarming growth rate -- up to 1,000 percent within the Mojave since the 1970s. Ravens thrive here because they make use of our water features, landfills, illegal dumps, trash, pet food left outdoors, and even road kill for reliable sources of sustenance. As we spread further across the desert, so do the raven's numbers. During the 1980s, Dr. Berry and her colleagues documented how ravens may methodically prey on young tortoises and contribute to high juvenile tortoise mortality rates. In one study alone, one single mated pair was found, over a four-year period, to have fed on about 250 juvenile tortoises whose pecked out shells were discovered at the base of the ravens' nest and roost -- a Joshua tree. Raven perches typically are fence or utility poles common throughout the desert. Current and recent government policy on raven predation of tortoises was developed as the result of a legal settlement with the Human Society of the U.S. more than 20 years ago. Evidence that a particular raven has recently killed more than one juvenile tortoise is necessary before the raven can be removed from the location.

As Las Vegas and other desert cities spread their suburban tentacles out into the undisturbed desert so disappears valued tortoise habitat. Gopherus agassizii's threatened status has ensured that any entity wishing to legally remove desert tortoises within an area slated for development must, in exchange, finance a costly mitigation effort to offset their displacement and loss of habitat. For example, developers wishing to build in Clark County, Nevada must pay a ""disturbance fee"" of $550 per acre (up to 145,000 acres) for private land and $836 per acre for public land development. The collected fees are used to offset costs of slated and active conservation projects. Other developers opt for translocation under professional supervision to ""complimentary"" sites purchased by them for this purpose.

Ever-expanding military bases, mining operations, and more recent massive renewable solar and wind projects sited in remote desert locations including BrightSource's Ivanpah Valley facility -- considered by biologists to be prized desert tortoise habitat -- have opted to relocate large numbers of desert tortoises at a huge cost. Many earlier attempts to translocate wild desert tortoises, including a poorly designed effort at Fort Irwin in 2008, resulted in deaths of hundreds of tortoises. Although techniques for translocating wild tortoises may have improved, those managing to survive live with the possibility that they may be moved again and again if the mitigation site is not properly protected well into the future.

In another twist of fate, the former 220-acre Desert Tortoise Conservation Center located in south Las Vegas shuttered its doors in 2014 because of dwindling local and federal funding. In operation for 23 years, this ""tortoise gulag"" was opened and funded through mitigation developer money with the intention to house displaced wild desert tortoises, but became overcrowded with surrendered pet tortoises early on, which do remarkably well in captivity but are often carriers of infectious diseases, making them unfit to release into the wild. Taking in nearly 1,000 animals annually, the facility's operational funding dropped to a trickle after the housing bubble burst in 2008. To complicate matters, many of the interned tortoises had developed the chronic and potentially fatal URTD, and thousands were consequently euthanized according to protocol. In later years, it was determined that tortoises could recover from and still carry the disease, so the mass killings were ended. By the time the facility closed its doors, it was estimated that more than 10,000 tortoises had been released into the wild at various federal land holdings, namely Nevada National Security Site and the large-scale translocation site near Jean, Nevada. It is not known how many of the released tortoises have or will survive this recent translocated fate.

Ideally, intact habitat solely dedicated to the desert tortoise and the ecological web it is part of is the best management strategy for Gopherus agassizii. An example of one such sanctuary is the 25,000-acre Desert Tortoise Research Natural Area (DTNA) located within the western Mojave near California City and managed by the BLM -- the area established between 1973 and 1980 with the help of Dr. Berry and her colleagues. This ""Area of Critical Environmental Concern"" had one of the highest densities of Gopherus agassizii per square mile with up 200 to 300 individual tortoises in some areas of the DTNA, until URTD spread across the western Mojave, taking many adults. Ravens have been responsible for inhibiting recovery by killing juveniles. However, although this site suffered catastrophic losses, a recent survey showed that tortoise densities are several-fold higher here than on adjacent federal land, designated as critical habitat for the tortoise. The fence around the DTNA has protected both tortoises and habitat from sheep grazing and off-highway vehicle recreation since 1980. The site is a two-hour drive from Los Angeles or Bakersfield. When planning a visit keep in mind that you are more likely to see active tortoises early in the day during the spring months.

33,"Just under the canopies of the tropical rainforests of West Africa live nearly 200 bird species that have evolved to excel in one of the oldest and most biologically diverse places on Earth. Their large eyes help them see when little sunlight penetrates the thick foliage; their diets are tuned to specific varieties of insect that thrive there. As with all real estate, location is everything.

So it’s understandable that when the forest is cut down, the birds don’t do so well. In fact, they do terribly: Recent research in Ghana’s Upper Guinea region shows that since the mid-1990s, more than half the birds there have died. Some species have it even worse: Yellow-whiskered Greenbul populations declined by 73 percent, Icterine Greenbul populations by 90 percent.

Illegal logging is most likely to blame (even though it’s tough to prove this kind of cause-and-effect scientifically). “The biggest difference between [now and] 15 years earlier is just a proliferation and intensification of illegal logging,” says author and Drexel University ecologist Nicole Arcilla. Illegal logging now makes up 80 percent of Ghana’s timber production—and logging rates are an outrageous six times what’s considered sustainable.

The situation in Ghana is just one example of the toll illegal logging is taking on wildlife around the world. In tropical forests across Central Africa, the Amazon, and Southeast Asia, between 50 percent and 90 percent of the logging is illegal, according to a study by the United Nations Environmental Programme. The World Bank estimates that a chunk of forest the size of a football field is cleared every two seconds, worldwide.

Obviously, this is potentially devastating for the wildlife that lives in these forests (not to mention the fact that forests serve as a critical carbon sink, but that’s a whole other problem). But it’s not an unsolvable issue. There are several ways forests can be economically productive without threatening the birds and other wildlife that rely on them. Arcilla, and other researchers, offered the following advice on how logging and birds can mix more sustainably in Ghana—many of the lessons can also be applied to other rapidly disappearing forests.

Cut Less

The length of time a forest is off-limits after logging, known as a logging cycle, is crucial to whether and how well birds recover within them. A 2012 modeling study found that 40-year cycles will keep 80 percent of the forest’s population intact, provided no more than 45 percent of the wood is removed. A recent review of research found that even after 40 years, the most-affected species were still struggling, so 40 years should be considered a minimum.

Many countries have the right rules on paper, but illegal loggers, by definition of course, don’t follow them. In Ghana, a 40-year logging cycle exists—in theory. But “the prescribed policies for logging, which were working, are not being followed,” Acilla says. “And so the logging is totally unsustainable. It more resembles deforestation than logging.” But illegal loggers often follow behind permitted operations and cut down trees that should be left alone for decades. In many places this means that the cycles are between 25-30 years instead. “Nowadays, the cycles are too short for the bird populations to recover,” says Zuzana Burivalova, an ecologist at ETH Zurich who headed the study.

Patrol More

Ghana’s national parks already have rangers patrolling the forests, and Arcilla’s research shows they’re effective in keeping illegal activity to a minimum. But more than 90 percent of the country’s forested area is inside a forest reserve, where no such patrols exist. Expanding the patrols into the forest reserves would likely cut down on the illegal logging that’s devastating bird populations. Of course, it would cost money, but Arcilla says that shouldn’t be the problem: “It costs something, but it creates jobs, the cost is affordable, and I think a lot of people would be willing to help Ghana pay that cost.”

Block Roads

In order to cull trees from a forest, you first have to get to them, and that means building roads. Permitted loggers typically clear their own access routes, but once they’ve finished, the paths remain, free for illegal loggers to use. A practical way to stop illegal loggers is simply to get in their way, Arcilla says. Rewarding companies who dig trenches, set up metal gates, and post guards at their forest roads after they’ve used them can help keep the trees standing.

Better yet, build fewer roads. The road problem is twofold for wildlife: Not only do roads allow possibly ill-intentioned humans in, they also fracture habitat. A 2005 radio-tracking study in Brazil found that while most birds were able to fly over small roads, larger clearings stranded the birds that have evolved to stay within the forest’s dark, humid areas, says Bill Laurance, an ecologist at James Cook University in Australia. (Laurance’s wife Susan Laurance authored the study.) Sometimes these roads end up separating birds from one another and from their homes. Limiting the size and number of roads and filling them in once they’re out of use could help wildlife, and stop loggers. “We’re dealing with some of the most specialized wildlife on the planet here,” Laurance says.

Strengthen (and Enforce) Laws

Most of the wood felled in Ghana does not stay there. Worldwide, illegal logging generates somewhere between $30 billion and $100 billion annually. Import countries can fight illegal logging by refusing to accept illegally sourced products. In 2008, the United States amended the Lacey Act, which has been used to fight wildlife crime for more than a century, to include plants and plant products, expanding its power to tamp down on illegal timber harvesting. The European Union and Australia have made similar progress, but one big holdout remains: China (in fact, China’s imports have skyrocketed, and the country’s shown little sign of improvement). Reducing demand could be key to solving, or at least reducing, the problem.

More broadly, the international community needs to show West Africa and other tropical countries that their forests are more valuable intact than they are destroyed. Beyond the intrinsic value of keeping birds alive, the forests can also generate money via ecotourism. The White-necked Picathartes is a prime example: One of only two species in its genus, the unusual bird was believed to be extinct in Ghana for decades until a research expedition happened to trap one in 2006. Standing more than a foot tall and topped with a featherless, bright yellow head, the Picathartes is now a favorite among visitors to West African forests. “It’s a very charismatic bird,” Arcilla says, and its popularity supports guides who can show it to curious birdwatchers, and who work to protect the bird’s habitat in order to guard their livelihood. Tourism can similarly bring in money to support other solutions on this list, more proof of the true value of healthy forests.

“I do not think this problem will be solved if there is not international attention,” Arcilla says. “If there is international attention, it can and will be solved.” For the birds’ sake, let’s hope so.",How to Log a Forest Without Hurting Birds,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1ZHVib24ub3JnL25ld3MvaG93LWxvZy1mb3Jlc3Qtd2l0aG91dC1odXJ0aW5nLWJpcmRz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.audubon.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_mobile/public/editorial-card-images/article/ec_sfw_icterine-greenbul-pr.jpg?itok=hzXRhxwF,2015-09-30,"{'sent': 'Just under the canopies of the tropical rainforests of West Africa live nearly 200 bird species that have evolved to excel in one of the oldest and most biologically diverse places on Earth.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['West Africa'], 'CARDINAL': ['one', 'nearly 200']}}","Just under the canopies of the tropical rainforests of West Africa live nearly 200 bird species that have evolved to excel in one of the oldest and most biologically diverse places on Earth.

34,"Venezuela is losing at least 900,000 animals every year to the $320 million illegal wildlife trade.

Among the birds sold to the pet trade are 50 species of New World parrot, parakeet and macaw endemic to Venezuela, along with American flamingoes and extremely rare red siskins.

Patrolling the country’s porous 2,800-kilometer coastline and nearly 5,000 kilometer border with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana is a daunting task for law enforcers trying to stop clever wildlife traffickers.

The hunters ransack the vulnerable nests of tropical birds in richly biodiverse but poorly patrolled Venezuelan rainforests. Wildlife merchants brazenly display young fledglings, monkeys and other animals, right next to main roads throughout the forest. Many captives will travel a difficult path — an exhausting, often fatal journey covering thousands of miles, cleverly hidden inside bags and luggage, passing through airports and seaports, bound for Europe and elsewhere. It is a lucrative, shadowy trade, involving at least 900,000 animals annually, earning more than 300 million dollars for the criminals plying it, from which the local rainforest hunter gleans barely a fistful of Bolivares.

AAccording to a 2013 report Your Home Is Not Their Home, produced by the conservation organization Vitalis, the ransacking of bird nests and theft of fledglings is the main method by which tropical birds are captured in Venezuela. Biologist Esmeralda Mujica, former director of the Foundation of Zoos and Aquariums of Venezuela, a member of the Species Survival Commission of IUCN and co-author of the Vitalis paper, says that the Psittacidae — including 50 species of New World parrot, parakeet and macaw endemic to Venezuela — is the bird family most threatened by traffickers, and spring is the time of year when the most fledglings are seized.

“The Easter holiday coincides with the reproductive season of parrots, which makes the hunting of fledglings a very easy endeavor all through the Llanos [vast tropical plain] and Southern Venezuela,” says Mujica. “The [local] people live in rural areas where hospitals don’t even have needles, and jobs are hard to come by,” she says, so the easy money made from hunting parrots is often vital to feeding their families.

The young captive birds readily adapt to human manipulation and hand feeding, so are easy to transport and very popular for trafficking. The most commonly captured and trafficked Venezuelan Psittacidae are the Red and Green Macaws (Ara chloroptera and Ara militaris), Yellow-shouldered Parrots (Amazona barbedensis), Yellow-crowned Parrots (Amazona ochrocephala), Brown-throated Parakeets (Aratinda pertinax venezuelae) and Black-headed Caiques (Pionites melanocephala).

Pirated coastal flamingos

The estuarine wildlife refuge known as “Ciénaga de Los Olivitos” in northwestern Venezuela borders on Colombia and the Caribbean Sea, and it has been described as a “delivery room” by local ecologists. That is because it comprises the resting, feeding and nesting grounds for a great many species of terrestrial and aquatic birds, both local and migratory. One of these birds is the American flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) — a species that thrives in the refuge and that is prized by wildlife traffickers.

“Some of the fishermen work as [flamingo] transporters, taking the chicks and bringing them hidden inside their boats to the Dutch Antilles, from where they are usually taken to Florida,” reveals Elíos Ríos, an environmental health doctor working at the local Health Authority and an active member of several environmental NGOs including Grupo Mangle (the Mangrove Group), Amigos del Bosque (Friends of the Forest) and Ecosistema Revolucionario (Revolutionary Ecosystem).

“Environmentalists and the Venezuelan Ministry for the Environment [which recently changed its name to the Ministry of Ecosocialism and Water] have denounced [trafficking] problems through the media,” Ríos told mongabay.com. “We have also insisted on education for coastal communities, whose members usually sell the animals for a few Bolivares without understanding the ecosystem alterations [and damage] this implies. Each species has a function in this bioregion related to their ecological niche.”

Ríos hopes for firmer government actions aimed at reducing the demand for wild birds and other species. “This is trafficking with life and it is deteriorating our ecosystems. It is bringing some species to the brink of extinction. Responsibility must be established internationally, and traffickers must [realize] that they are criminals and will be incarcerated if they enter the country. Our constitution compels us; a healthy environment is a right for future generations,” Rios declares.

But the trade goes on largely unhampered, and helped by major organized crime syndicates working at the region’s famous Flea Market, an informal bazaar held in the capital of Zulia State, the province that is home to the Ciénaga de Los Olivitos refuge.

Ríos notes that environmental groups have made a formal complaint to the government concerning the trafficking, but the National Guard took minimal action — making a show of attacking some minor local traffickers, but taking no real decisive steps to staunch the flow of animals from estuarine ecosystems to other nations. “Trafficking is not a [government] priority”, he says.

Plundering Venezuela’s biological riches

Up to date information on wildlife trafficking and its causes in Venezuela is not easy to come by, but according to a 2003 study called Impact of the Venezuelan economic crisis on wild populations of animals and plants, produced by scientist and activist Dr. Jon Paul Rodríguez, Venezuela’s periodic economic contractions have markedly increased the exploitation of wild fauna and flora, especially since 1983 after the so called “Black Friday”, a drastic devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. As economic times have grown harder in recent years, those with limited means have been compelled to join the black market in wildlife trading.

Rodríguez, who works in the Ecology Department of the Venezuela Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC) and is president of environmental NGO Provita, explains that more than birds are trafficked. On the coast, many tropical fish, lobster and the Caribbean queen conch (Strombus gigas) are fished and illegally trafficked as gourmet delicacies.

The country’s 2,800-kilometer (1,740-mile) coastline, plus offshore islands, make policing of trafficking difficult, with authorities already overstretched by a rash of armed boardings and robberies by pirates against pleasure craft — some involving violence. More than 85 such piracies are documented between 2008-11, and more occurred in 2013.

Traditional fishermen have taken advantage of lax enforcement by trafficking more. “When industrial trawling was banned [in local waters], traditional fisheries flourished and these don’t necessarily have a smaller impact on the environment,” Rodríguez notes. His study found that the traditional fishing fleet doubled from 1970 to 1995, while the commercial fleet operating in continental waters tripled in size. Traditional fishermen are very poorly regulated compared to commercial trawlers, and can trade in threatened tropical fish species with little worry of prosecution.

One of Rodriguez’ students, Chilean biologist Marianne Asmussen, has travelled the roads and wilds of Venezuela talking to wildlife hunters and learning more about trafficking trends and techniques. She searched through national and international databases, magazines, webpages, restaurants and pet shops in an attempt to calculate the size of the illegal market of wild fauna. Asmussen estimates that more than 900,000 individual animals of 426 different species are trafficked per year in Venezuela, with a net worth of over 321 million dollars — almost certainly an underestimate.

Asmussen produced a profile of hunters and the market after visiting 19 Venezuelan trafficking hotspots. All 40 wildlife merchants that she contacted were male; 74 percent of prey was birds, most frequently the Brown-throated Parakeet, Yellow-crowned Parrot and Venezuelan Troupial, the national bird of Venezuela, a spectacular orange, black and white New World oriole.

During her investigation, Asmussen learned about trafficking methods, including inside containers on cargo ships leaving Puerto La Cruz, an Eastern Venezuelan seaport. However, she found that the most common route used by traffickers was by ground. Captive wildlife is easily and discreetly moved across the nearly 5,000 kilometer (3,100 mile) border that Venezuela shares with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana. Asmussen admits that “lack of data” leaves the many trafficking techniques and routes in deep shadow.

She also found large voids in trafficking databases, as well as underestimates in the literature about illegal trade of wildlife. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which includes the Red Siskin, the Yellow-shouldered Parrot and macaws in its Appendix I (Threatened with Extinction) listing, showed an annual total of just 257 reptiles, 44 birds, and 15 mammals illegally traded in Venezuela from 1975 to 2008.

At the other end of one trafficking route, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) seized an average of 21 illegally trafficked Venezuelan animals transported into the U.S. market between 1994 and 2000.

These figures don’t begin to reflect the rapid, devastating decline in Venezuelan biodiversity. Take Red Siskin populations, for example. The numbers of this attractive, small, red-and-black finch in Venezuela have fallen to between 250 and 1,000 remaining individuals, although there are more optimistic estimates of up to 4,000 birds, according to the IUCN — this is a population that is far smaller, but far less conserved, than the world’s remaining rhinos or polar bears.

Red Siskins for sale

The Red Siskin (Carduelis cucullata), popularly called the “cardenalito” in Venezuela is thought to live today only in Lara state ,where it gives its name to the local baseball team. But according to IUCN, the bird once occurred in 15 states throughout the northern foothills of Venezuela, reduced to only eight states as of 2008.

Lara province gives refuge to some of the last individuals of this species, after illegal trafficking for the pet trade decimated it’s populations through the rest of its range in the Caribbean basin. The little birds are “subject to enormous, long-term (and since the 1940s, illegal) pressure from trappers, primarily because of its capacity to hybridize with canaries,” says IUCN.

The Red Siskin is already extinct in Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Isla de Monos, where it was likely introduced. There are reports of other populations in Guyana since 2002, but it is not clear whether they were introduced or are endemic populations. The last sightings in Colombia were in 2000 and 1986.

In 2013, a trafficker spoke anonymously to the webpage armando.info about his methods for transporting Red Siskins. In order to slip past Venezuelan enforcers, he never travels with more than 8 individual birds, which are smuggled inside gift boxes with small breathing holes cut into them. One month before the trip, he puts the birds on a diet of highly nutritious broccoli and apples, which allows them to survive without food during transport. They go through airport security as hand luggage because the birds aren’t detected by x-ray machines, as their bones are hollow. The siskins are hidden from sunlight throughout the journey to keep them from singing. The trafficker claims to have traded in the little birds undetected for 20 years.

Veterinarian Miguel Ángel Arvelo confirms these methods. He’s a leader at “Iniciativa Cardenalito” (the Siskin Initiative), an alliance between public and private institutions in several countries dedicated to the study of siskin populations, their habitat and conservation — an organization with a strong volunteer base and sponsors, which received over $100,000 in major grants and donations in 2015.

The group is working with the Smithsonian Institute to map the siskin’s genome. The aim of this project is to produce breeding and handling protocols for captive populations. Partnering in that endeavor is Rodríguez´s Provita and IVIC, and two Venezuelan zoo parks, as well as entities from Colombia and Guyana.

The veterinarian explains how hunters capture the small finches. The siskin is attracted by a hunter’s birdcall, then gets stuck in glue that has been placed on a tree next to an artificial decoy. Since the siskin rarely reaches 100 grams of body weight (3.5 ounces), the hunters can easily stow the tiny captives in pockets and bags.

Unfortunately, the birds’ survival chances after just 12 hours without food are very low: “They have an extremely accelerated metabolism,” explains Arvelo. “They feed on seeds and must eat at all hours. When we rescue them [from traffickers] we must give them a glucose shot, hydration and warmth, so that the animal stops losing its energy trying to regulate its temperature.”

The high demand for siskins comes from a particular genetic quality of the bird. When mated with a canary, a female siskin produces fertile red canaries, which are highly varied and prized in the global pet trade. This explains why Red Siskins are not sold along roads and on webpages as parrots and monkeys commonly are. Instead says, Angel Arvelo, “The buyer of siskins is more specialized, is a connoisseur”.

Taking action to curb trafficking

Of late, Venezuela’s federal government has begun to take a more aggressive stance against environmental degradation and trafficking. New laws have been passed to protect the environment, and existing regulations have been adapted to combat trafficking. Venezuela is a member of CITES and recognizes it as the law of the land.

Federal prosecutors conducted an impressive 5,544 environmental trials in the first eight months of 2015, but only a few were trafficking related. Prosecutors have been closely collaborating with the National Guard, the country’s official environmental watchdog, which chose not to comment for this article. One anonymous official did tell mongabay.com that authorities receive at least one report per week of illegal trafficking in their offices in El Paraíso, Caracas.

Activists agree, however, that wildlife seizures remain very occasional and primarily focused in urban Caracas. They note that public officials, law enforcement and citizens across the country and especially in rural areas, are still not properly informed about what they can, and should, do if they witness illegal trafficking. Recently, the Tourism and Ecosocialism ministries partnered with environmental organizations in an information and education campaign to try to discourage potential wildlife buyers.

While surveillance remains poor and spotty, increasingly frequent arrests of traffickers and the confiscation of captive animals is rapidly depleting zoo budgets, as facilities are overwhelmed by rescued animals. Setting up permanent rescue facilities to triage and care for a wide range of confiscated animals, birds and fish, and return them safely to the wild, will require a major commitment by government and NGOs.

Clearly, federal and provincial authorities, along with NGOs and the people of Venezuela, will need to join hands in taking even stronger steps to thwart wildlife traffickers if the country is to bring the pillaging of the nation’s natural treasure houses under control.",Trafficked tropical animals: the ghost exports of Venezuela,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxNS8xMC90cmFmZmlja2VkLXRyb3BpY2FsLWFuaW1hbHMtdGhlLWdob3N0LWV4cG9ydHMtb2YtdmVuZXp1ZWxhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2015/10/03151725/featured-image-venezuela-433x330.jpg,2015-10-01,"{'sent': 'Venezuela is losing at least 900,000 animals every year to the $320 million illegal wildlife trade.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Venezuela'], 'CARDINAL': ['at least 900,000'], 'MONEY': ['$320 million']}}","Venezuela is losing at least 900,000 animals every year to the $320 million illegal wildlife trade.

“Environmentalists and the Venezuelan Ministry for the Environment [which recently changed its name to the Ministry of Ecosocialism and Water] have denounced [trafficking] problems through the media,” Ríos told mongabay.com. “We have also insisted on education for coastal communities, whose members usually sell the animals for a few Bolivares without understanding the ecosystem alterations [and damage] this implies. Each species has a function in this bioregion related to their ecological niche.”

Ríos hopes for firmer government actions aimed at reducing the demand for wild birds and other species. “This is trafficking with life and it is deteriorating our ecosystems. It is bringing some species to the brink of extinction. Responsibility must be established internationally, and traffickers must [realize] that they are criminals and will be incarcerated if they enter the country. Our constitution compels us; a healthy environment is a right for future generations,” Rios declares.

But the trade goes on largely unhampered, and helped by major organized crime syndicates working at the region’s famous Flea Market, an informal bazaar held in the capital of Zulia State, the province that is home to the Ciénaga de Los Olivitos refuge.

Ríos notes that environmental groups have made a formal complaint to the government concerning the trafficking, but the National Guard took minimal action — making a show of attacking some minor local traffickers, but taking no real decisive steps to staunch the flow of animals from estuarine ecosystems to other nations. “Trafficking is not a [government] priority”, he says.

Plundering Venezuela’s biological riches

Up to date information on wildlife trafficking and its causes in Venezuela is not easy to come by, but according to a 2003 study called Impact of the Venezuelan economic crisis on wild populations of animals and plants, produced by scientist and activist Dr. Jon Paul Rodríguez, Venezuela’s periodic economic contractions have markedly increased the exploitation of wild fauna and flora, especially since 1983 after the so called “Black Friday”, a drastic devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. As economic times have grown harder in recent years, those with limited means have been compelled to join the black market in wildlife trading.

Rodríguez, who works in the Ecology Department of the Venezuela Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC) and is president of environmental NGO Provita, explains that more than birds are trafficked. On the coast, many tropical fish, lobster and the Caribbean queen conch (Strombus gigas) are fished and illegally trafficked as gourmet delicacies.

The country’s 2,800-kilometer (1,740-mile) coastline, plus offshore islands, make policing of trafficking difficult, with authorities already overstretched by a rash of armed boardings and robberies by pirates against pleasure craft — some involving violence. More than 85 such piracies are documented between 2008-11, and more occurred in 2013.

Traditional fishermen have taken advantage of lax enforcement by trafficking more. “When industrial trawling was banned [in local waters], traditional fisheries flourished and these don’t necessarily have a smaller impact on the environment,” Rodríguez notes. His study found that the traditional fishing fleet doubled from 1970 to 1995, while the commercial fleet operating in continental waters tripled in size. Traditional fishermen are very poorly regulated compared to commercial trawlers, and can trade in threatened tropical fish species with little worry of prosecution.

One of Rodriguez’ students, Chilean biologist Marianne Asmussen, has travelled the roads and wilds of Venezuela talking to wildlife hunters and learning more about trafficking trends and techniques. She searched through national and international databases, magazines, webpages, restaurants and pet shops in an attempt to calculate the size of the illegal market of wild fauna. Asmussen estimates that more than 900,000 individual animals of 426 different species are trafficked per year in Venezuela, with a net worth of over 321 million dollars — almost certainly an underestimate.

Asmussen produced a profile of hunters and the market after visiting 19 Venezuelan trafficking hotspots. All 40 wildlife merchants that she contacted were male; 74 percent of prey was birds, most frequently the Brown-throated Parakeet, Yellow-crowned Parrot and Venezuelan Troupial, the national bird of Venezuela, a spectacular orange, black and white New World oriole.

During her investigation, Asmussen learned about trafficking methods, including inside containers on cargo ships leaving Puerto La Cruz, an Eastern Venezuelan seaport. However, she found that the most common route used by traffickers was by ground. Captive wildlife is easily and discreetly moved across the nearly 5,000 kilometer (3,100 mile) border that Venezuela shares with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana. Asmussen admits that “lack of data” leaves the many trafficking techniques and routes in deep shadow.

She also found large voids in trafficking databases, as well as underestimates in the literature about illegal trade of wildlife. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which includes the Red Siskin, the Yellow-shouldered Parrot and macaws in its Appendix I (Threatened with Extinction) listing, showed an annual total of just 257 reptiles, 44 birds, and 15 mammals illegally traded in Venezuela from 1975 to 2008.

At the other end of one trafficking route, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) seized an average of 21 illegally trafficked Venezuelan animals transported into the U.S. market between 1994 and 2000.

These figures don’t begin to reflect the rapid, devastating decline in Venezuelan biodiversity. Take Red Siskin populations, for example. The numbers of this attractive, small, red-and-black finch in Venezuela have fallen to between 250 and 1,000 remaining individuals, although there are more optimistic estimates of up to 4,000 birds, according to the IUCN — this is a population that is far smaller, but far less conserved, than the world’s remaining rhinos or polar bears.

Red Siskins for sale

The Red Siskin (Carduelis cucullata), popularly called the “cardenalito” in Venezuela is thought to live today only in Lara state ,where it gives its name to the local baseball team. But according to IUCN, the bird once occurred in 15 states throughout the northern foothills of Venezuela, reduced to only eight states as of 2008.

Lara province gives refuge to some of the last individuals of this species, after illegal trafficking for the pet trade decimated it’s populations through the rest of its range in the Caribbean basin. The little birds are “subject to enormous, long-term (and since the 1940s, illegal) pressure from trappers, primarily because of its capacity to hybridize with canaries,” says IUCN.

The Red Siskin is already extinct in Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Isla de Monos, where it was likely introduced. There are reports of other populations in Guyana since 2002, but it is not clear whether they were introduced or are endemic populations. The last sightings in Colombia were in 2000 and 1986.

In 2013, a trafficker spoke anonymously to the webpage armando.info about his methods for transporting Red Siskins. In order to slip past Venezuelan enforcers, he never travels with more than 8 individual birds, which are smuggled inside gift boxes with small breathing holes cut into them. One month before the trip, he puts the birds on a diet of highly nutritious broccoli and apples, which allows them to survive without food during transport. They go through airport security as hand luggage because the birds aren’t detected by x-ray machines, as their bones are hollow. The siskins are hidden from sunlight throughout the journey to keep them from singing. The trafficker claims to have traded in the little birds undetected for 20 years.

Veterinarian Miguel Ángel Arvelo confirms these methods. He’s a leader at “Iniciativa Cardenalito” (the Siskin Initiative), an alliance between public and private institutions in several countries dedicated to the study of siskin populations, their habitat and conservation — an organization with a strong volunteer base and sponsors, which received over $100,000 in major grants and donations in 2015.

The group is working with the Smithsonian Institute to map the siskin’s genome. The aim of this project is to produce breeding and handling protocols for captive populations. Partnering in that endeavor is Rodríguez´s Provita and IVIC, and two Venezuelan zoo parks, as well as entities from Colombia and Guyana.

The veterinarian explains how hunters capture the small finches. The siskin is attracted by a hunter’s birdcall, then gets stuck in glue that has been placed on a tree next to an artificial decoy. Since the siskin rarely reaches 100 grams of body weight (3.5 ounces), the hunters can easily stow the tiny captives in pockets and bags.

Unfortunately, the birds’ survival chances after just 12 hours without food are very low: “They have an extremely accelerated metabolism,” explains Arvelo. “They feed on seeds and must eat at all hours. When we rescue them [from traffickers] we must give them a glucose shot, hydration and warmth, so that the animal stops losing its energy trying to regulate its temperature.”

The high demand for siskins comes from a particular genetic quality of the bird. When mated with a canary, a female siskin produces fertile red canaries, which are highly varied and prized in the global pet trade. This explains why Red Siskins are not sold along roads and on webpages as parrots and monkeys commonly are. Instead says, Angel Arvelo, “The buyer of siskins is more specialized, is a connoisseur”.

Taking action to curb trafficking

Of late, Venezuela’s federal government has begun to take a more aggressive stance against environmental degradation and trafficking. New laws have been passed to protect the environment, and existing regulations have been adapted to combat trafficking. Venezuela is a member of CITES and recognizes it as the law of the land.

Federal prosecutors conducted an impressive 5,544 environmental trials in the first eight months of 2015, but only a few were trafficking related. Prosecutors have been closely collaborating with the National Guard, the country’s official environmental watchdog, which chose not to comment for this article. One anonymous official did tell mongabay.com that authorities receive at least one report per week of illegal trafficking in their offices in El Paraíso, Caracas.

Activists agree, however, that wildlife seizures remain very occasional and primarily focused in urban Caracas. They note that public officials, law enforcement and citizens across the country and especially in rural areas, are still not properly informed about what they can, and should, do if they witness illegal trafficking. Recently, the Tourism and Ecosocialism ministries partnered with environmental organizations in an information and education campaign to try to discourage potential wildlife buyers.

While surveillance remains poor and spotty, increasingly frequent arrests of traffickers and the confiscation of captive animals is rapidly depleting zoo budgets, as facilities are overwhelmed by rescued animals. Setting up permanent rescue facilities to triage and care for a wide range of confiscated animals, birds and fish, and return them safely to the wild, will require a major commitment by government and NGOs.

Clearly, federal and provincial authorities, along with NGOs and the people of Venezuela, will need to join hands in taking even stronger steps to thwart wildlife traffickers if the country is to bring the pillaging of the nation’s natural treasure houses under control.",HUNTING

MARION VAN DIJK/FAIRFAX MEDIA Fantails are baby-making machines.

KERERŪ CAN GET DRUNK ON FOREST BERRIES

We all know kererū are gluttons. Come springtime, they're often seen guzzling berries and doing anything (including hanging upside down in trees) to get a good feed. But when New Zealand pigeons gorge on too much fruit, they must sit in the sun to digest it. And when the weather is good, ripe fruit can ferment in their crop and turn to alcohol, getting them sufficiently boozed up and giving new meaning to the term ""daytime drinking"". In years where fruit is bountiful, there have been widespread reports of kererū literally falling out of trees because they're too drunk to perch.

FANTAILS ARE BABY-MAKING MACHINES

The friendly ""cheet cheet"" call of the fantail would be much more common if it wasn't for introduced predators wiping out their nests. Every year, between spring and summer, fantails can make up to 4 nests, raising 5 chicks in each. They should be as common as blowflies around a dunny. But rats, stoats and possums eat their chicks, eggs, and even adults before they even get a chance to leave the nest.

KĀREAREA ARE NEW ZEALAND'S FASTEST FLYING BIRD

The New Zealand falcon is faster than a V8 supercar and perfectly adapted to take fast corners. Flying at speeds of up to 230 kilometres an hour, they are perfectly adapted to swoop and dart through the forest in pursuit of live prey. These aerial acrobats are highly territorial and a pair recently made the news for launching ""fists of fury"" in Wellington to protect their nests.

BLACK-BILLED GULLS ARE WORLD'S MOST THREATENED GULL

You may see gulls every time you visit the beach but their numbers are falling so fast they now appear on the threatened species' list. Found mostly in the South Island, black-billed gulls live inland and nest on braided rivers where they are well hidden among the rocks and shingle. But why are they so threatened? There's the usual tale of introduced predators like cats, rats and stoats eating their chicks and eggs. Humans, dogs, even other birds can disturb the adults, forcing them to abandon their nests and leaving their eggs exposed to the heat where they get fried. People haven't been particularly kind to them either. Remember when hundreds of these gulls were shot, or that time someone drove their car through a breeding colony?

ALBATROSS HAVE THE BIRD WORLD'S LOWEST DIVORCE RATE

""Divorce"" is a word we usually associate with humans but some birds also fail to mate for life. But not the albatross. A study on the breeding behaviour of birds found that albatross have the lowest ""divorce rate"" in the bird world and are completely faithful to one another. These handsome ocean wanderers return to land every 2 years to breed with the same partner. But not all birds have the option of coming home. Every year 100,000 albatrosses are killed at the end of fishing hooks. Adult birds are attracted to baited hooks, get caught, and are drowned - leaving their life partners to wait and wonder.

TUI HAVE TWO VOICE BOXES

Tūī have beautiful voices. But they can also sound like they're nursing a bad cough. Having two voice boxes is how they sing their incredibly varied song that combines clicks, barks, cackles and wheezes. Some of their sounds can be too high for humans to hear, so if you see a silent tūī with its beak open and its chest puffed out - you will know why. Tūī are also great mimics and Māori prized them for their ability to imitate things, keeping them in cages to welcome people onto the marae. One bird even learnt the Pizza Hutt jingle!

NEW ZEALAND IS HOME TO THE WORLD'S RAREST DUCK

You may not have heard of the Campbell Island teal but it's a real battler. Found only on Campbell Island in the Southern Ocean, it was thought to be extinct until 1974 when Heritage Expeditions founder Rodney Russ helped rediscover them. The Department of Conservation quickly started a rigorous captive breeding programme, removed introduced predators from Campbell Island, and released over 150 ducks to the wild where they are now thriving.

BLACK STILTS LURE PREDATORS BY PRETENDING TO HAVE A BROKEN WING

These ""distraction displays"" are meant to divert the attention of predators away from the nest or young birds. Talk about sacrifice! Predators will go for the easier target as injured prey is much easier to take down. Unfortunately for the black stilt, feigning an injury only slows down the process of them being killed by introduced predators. As with many of New Zealand's birds, they are unable to protect themselves against the onslaught of rats, cats and stoats.

GODWITS FLY OVER 11,000 KILOMETRES TO ARRIVE IN NEW ZEALAND

These long-haul fliers have the longest migratory flight of any bird in the world - and there's no chance of an in-flight snack. Their first stop is in China and Korea where the wetlands they depend on to feed are quickly disappearing. Then, it's onto Russia, through Canada and North America and over the Pacific to New Zealand, where around 90,000 godwits will spend their winter feeding along mudflats and estuaries.

KIWI ARE THE ONLY BIRD TO HAVE NOSTRILS AT THE END OF THEIR VERY LONG BILL

They use their nostrils to probe in the ground, sniffing out their dinner of invertebrates and fallen fruit. But this is just one of many weird facts about our national bird. They're also flightless, have long whiskers and hair like feathers. They have even been called an ""honorary mammal"" by some, which actually seems a bit ironic. Just like most of our native birds, kiwi are threatened by introduced mammals. Kiwi chicks are eaten by stoats, while adults are at risk of being attacked by dogs.

36,"Only nine percent of 1,451 migratory bird species in the world are sufficiently protected across their long annual migratory routes, according to a new study.

Researchers found that countries like France and Venezuela protect more than 80 percent of their migratory bird species, while India and China protect less than 10 percent of their migratory birds.

Increased international cooperation is key to protecting migratory bird species, experts say.

Migratory birds are awe-inspiring. Every year, millions traverse across oceans and continents, many each racking up thousands of miles as they fly. The longest marathon migrant, the Arctic tern, covers more than 70,000 kilometers (about 44,000 miles) annually during its journey from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and back.

However, very few migratory bird species are sufficiently protected across their long annual migratory routes, according to a new study published today in Science.

Researchers found that only nine percent of the 1,451 migratory bird species they studied have all phases of their annual migratory cycles — breeding and non-breeding areas, as well as all the spaces in between — adequately covered by protected areas. In comparison, around 45 percent of the world’s non-migratory bird species appear to be sufficiently covered by protected areas across their global distribution.

“The authors’ conclusion that more than nine-tenths of all migratory species are missing key habitats needed for their annual movements is flat-out scary,” William Laurance, an ecologist at James Cook University in Australia who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay. “It underscores a dimension of the modern biodiversity crisis that too few of us have appreciated adequately.”

Migratory birds barely protected

Previous studies have looked at how some specific migratory bird species are protected in particular parts of the world, Claire A. Runge, lead author from University of Queensland, Australia, told Mongabay. But this is the first study to look at all of the world’s migratory bird species — 1,451 in total — that have all phases of their annual cycles completely mapped, she said.

“This is the first time that anybody has put the whole puzzle together and got a comprehensive picture of the state of protection for migratory birds across the whole world,” she added.

Runge and her colleagues overlaid maps of the world’s protected areas onto distribution maps of the 1,451 migratory bird species, and analyzed the proportion of the birds’ distributions that were covered by protected areas. They assessed whether each stage — breeding and non-breeding grounds, as well as intermittent stopover sites or refuges — of their annual cycle was adequately covered by protected areas.

Runge’s team found that protection was grossly inadequate.

A typical migrant species needs two or three separate geographic locations along its migratory route, the researchers write, where the birds can rest or refuel. But the team found that for 91 percent of the 1,451 migratory bird species, one or more critical locations across their migratory cycle — important for breeding, resting or feeding — falls outside protected areas.

The situation is worse for migratory bird species that are threatened under the IUCN Red List. Less than three percent of threatened migratory bird species have adequate protected area coverage across all parts of their annual cycle, the team found.

Take for example, the vulnerable red-spectacled amazon (Amazona pretrei), a migratory parrot of Brazil. Less than four percent of its distribution falls within protected areas, the study found.

“We had expected to find a few species without adequate protection, but to find that despite all the efforts to expand protected areas that are currently underway, fewer than nine percent were adequately protected, that was very surprising,” Runge said.

To protect migratory bird species across the world, BirdLife partnership has identified nearly 8,500 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), which require focused conservation efforts, the authors write. However, just 22 percent of the world’s IBAs were completely covered by protected areas, the study found.

International protection

The degree of protection also varies across countries, some countries performing better than others, the study found.

For example, countries like France and Venezuela formally protect more than 80 percent of their migratory bird species, the team found. On the contrary, protected areas in India and China cover less than 10 percent of their migratory birds.

“In India, most of the protected areas have been established in forests, keeping tiger and large glamorous mega-vertebrates in mind,” Asad R. Rahmani, Senior Scientific Adviser at Bombay Natural History Society in India, who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay. “Not much attention was given to wetlands and grasslands, as a result of which many large wetlands are now in terrible condition.”

The lack of formal protection of wetlands in India is problematic because wetlands form nearly one-third of the IBAs in India, Rahmani added.

Runge’s team also found that in general, countries across North Africa and Central Asia have low protected area coverage of migratory bird distributions.

“These regions have relatively few protected areas,” Runge said. “And where they occur, they do not overlap sufficiently with the distribution of migratory birds.”

Way ahead

Given how global migratory bird distributions are, protecting these birds is no easy feat. In fact, protecting migratory birds needs greater effort than protecting non-migratory bird species, Runge said. This is because they need so many different locations to complete their life cycle, she added.

“Migrants need protection in their breeding and wintering areas, plus the places species need to go between those two,” Runge said. “Our study shows that, because of these higher demands, migrants are more vulnerable.”

So increased international cooperation is key to protecting migratory bird species, experts say.

Existing gaps in information also need to be filled. For example, information about how individual migratory birds move, and what locations might be the most critical to the long term future of each migrant species, is crucial, Runge said.

For countries like India that have very low protection coverage for migratory birds, IBAs that occur in wetlands, coastal mud-flats and inter-tidal zones need to be protected well, in collaboration with local communities, Rahmani said.

In fact, all possible IBAs need to be protected, Laurance added.

“We need to move quickly,” Laurance said. “In many regions, the window for viable action is closing fast because many key stopover or breeding habitats are vanishing right now.”

“Many people just don’t realize just how stressed and vulnerable birds are during their annual migrations,” Laurance added. “They’re burning incredible amounts of energy while flying great distances and rely crucially on places where they can stop for a few days to feed intensively. If these critical stopover habitats vanish—as it happening across much of the world—then they often just starve to death.”

“The authors’ conclusion that more than nine-tenths of all migratory species are missing key habitats needed for their annual movements is flat-out scary,” William Laurance, an ecologist at James Cook University in Australia who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay. “It underscores a dimension of the modern biodiversity crisis that too few of us have appreciated adequately.”

Migratory birds barely protected

Previous studies have looked at how some specific migratory bird species are protected in particular parts of the world, Claire A. Runge, lead author from University of Queensland, Australia, told Mongabay. But this is the first study to look at all of the world’s migratory bird species — 1,451 in total — that have all phases of their annual cycles completely mapped, she said.

“This is the first time that anybody has put the whole puzzle together and got a comprehensive picture of the state of protection for migratory birds across the whole world,” she added.

Runge and her colleagues overlaid maps of the world’s protected areas onto distribution maps of the 1,451 migratory bird species, and analyzed the proportion of the birds’ distributions that were covered by protected areas. They assessed whether each stage — breeding and non-breeding grounds, as well as intermittent stopover sites or refuges — of their annual cycle was adequately covered by protected areas.

Runge’s team found that protection was grossly inadequate.

A typical migrant species needs two or three separate geographic locations along its migratory route, the researchers write, where the birds can rest or refuel. But the team found that for 91 percent of the 1,451 migratory bird species, one or more critical locations across their migratory cycle — important for breeding, resting or feeding — falls outside protected areas.

The situation is worse for migratory bird species that are threatened under the IUCN Red List. Less than three percent of threatened migratory bird species have adequate protected area coverage across all parts of their annual cycle, the team found.

Take for example, the vulnerable red-spectacled amazon (Amazona pretrei), a migratory parrot of Brazil. Less than four percent of its distribution falls within protected areas, the study found.

“We had expected to find a few species without adequate protection, but to find that despite all the efforts to expand protected areas that are currently underway, fewer than nine percent were adequately protected, that was very surprising,” Runge said.

To protect migratory bird species across the world, BirdLife partnership has identified nearly 8,500 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), which require focused conservation efforts, the authors write. However, just 22 percent of the world’s IBAs were completely covered by protected areas, the study found.

International protection

The degree of protection also varies across countries, some countries performing better than others, the study found.

For example, countries like France and Venezuela formally protect more than 80 percent of their migratory bird species, the team found. On the contrary, protected areas in India and China cover less than 10 percent of their migratory birds.

“In India, most of the protected areas have been established in forests, keeping tiger and large glamorous mega-vertebrates in mind,” Asad R. Rahmani, Senior Scientific Adviser at Bombay Natural History Society in India, who was not involved in the study, told Mongabay. “Not much attention was given to wetlands and grasslands, as a result of which many large wetlands are now in terrible condition.”

The lack of formal protection of wetlands in India is problematic because wetlands form nearly one-third of the IBAs in India, Rahmani added.

Runge’s team also found that in general, countries across North Africa and Central Asia have low protected area coverage of migratory bird distributions.

“These regions have relatively few protected areas,” Runge said. “And where they occur, they do not overlap sufficiently with the distribution of migratory birds.”

Way ahead

Given how global migratory bird distributions are, protecting these birds is no easy feat. In fact, protecting migratory birds needs greater effort than protecting non-migratory bird species, Runge said. This is because they need so many different locations to complete their life cycle, she added.

“Migrants need protection in their breeding and wintering areas, plus the places species need to go between those two,” Runge said. “Our study shows that, because of these higher demands, migrants are more vulnerable.”

So increased international cooperation is key to protecting migratory bird species, experts say.

Existing gaps in information also need to be filled. For example, information about how individual migratory birds move, and what locations might be the most critical to the long term future of each migrant species, is crucial, Runge said.

For countries like India that have very low protection coverage for migratory birds, IBAs that occur in wetlands, coastal mud-flats and inter-tidal zones need to be protected well, in collaboration with local communities, Rahmani said.

In fact, all possible IBAs need to be protected, Laurance added.

“We need to move quickly,” Laurance said. “In many regions, the window for viable action is closing fast because many key stopover or breeding habitats are vanishing right now.”

“Many people just don’t realize just how stressed and vulnerable birds are during their annual migrations,” Laurance added. “They’re burning incredible amounts of energy while flying great distances and rely crucially on places where they can stop for a few days to feed intensively. If these critical stopover habitats vanish—as it happening across much of the world—then they often just starve to death.”

Over ninety percent of migratory birds across the world are inadequately protected, say the researchers, led by the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED), the world’s leading research centre for solving environmental management problems.

** An animal’s habitat is where it eats, sleeps, finds a mate, and finds shelter.

According to the study’s findings, which have been published in the journal Science, there are massive gaps in the conservation of migratory birds, particularly across India, China, and parts of South America and Africa.

This means that most species of migratory birds are flying over well-protected areas in one country, and then poorly-protected regions in another.

Migratory bird populations declining significantly

Lead author Dr. Claire Runge of CEED and the University of Queensland, said:

“More than half of migratory bird species travelling the world’s main flyways have suffered serious population declines in the past 30 years.”

“This is due mainly to unequal and ineffective protection across their migratory range and the places they stop to refuel along their routes. A typical migratory bird relies on many different geographic locations throughout its annual cycle for food, rest and breeding.”

“So even if we protect most of their breeding grounds, it’s still not enough – threats somewhere else can affect the entire population,” she says. “The chain can be broken at any link.”

Some birds travel incredible distances

These birds undertake extraordinary journeys, Dr. Runge explains, they navigate across sea and land to find refuge as the seasons change.

The Bar-Tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica), a large wader which breeds on Arctic coasts and tundra, spends its winters – 10,000 kilometres away – on coasts in temperate and tropical regions of the Old World and of New Zealand and Australia.

The Arctic Tern (Sterna paradisaea), a seabird of the tern family that sees two summers each year, flies the equivalent of the Moon and back three times during the course of its life.

The National Audubon Society says the Arctic Tern is famous as a long-distance champion. Some may migrate farther than any other birds, going from the high Arctic to the Antarctic. (Image: adapted from www.audubon.org)

Other examples include the Sooty Shearwater (Puffinus griseus), known as tītī or muttonbird in New Zealand, which flies 64,000 kilometres, and the tiny Blackpoll Warbler (Setophaga striata), which flies for three days non-stop over the ocean from eastern Canada to South America.

Lack of protection in many areas

Of the 1,451 migratory bird species studied in this latest research, 1,324 were found to have inadequate protection for at least one part of their migratory route.

Eighteen species have no protection at all in their breeding areas, while two species have no protection whatsoever along their whole flightpath.

For the migratory bird species that are listed as threatened – according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List by BirdLife International – fewer than 3% have sufficient protected areas.

Co-author Dr. Stuart Butchart, Head of Science at BirdLife International, said:

“For example, the red-spectacled amazon – a migratory parrot of Brazil – is threatened by habitat loss. And yet less than four per cent of its range is protected, and almost none of its seasonal breeding areas in southern Brazil are covered.”

The researchers also assessed more than 8,200 areas that have been identified as internationally important locations for migratory birds.

Only twenty-two percent of those areas were found to be completely protected. Forty-one percent partially overlap with protected areas.

Dr. Butchart said:

“Establishing new reserves to protect the unprotected sites – and more effectively managing all protected areas for migratory species – is critical to ensure the survival of these iconic species.”

International coordination crucial

Associate Professor Richard Fuller of CEED, who was also a co-author, said the results highlight the urgent need to coordinate all the protected areas along the birds’ full migration routes.

Prof. Fuller explained:

“For instance, Germany has protected areas for over 98 per cent of the migratory species that pass its borders, but fewer than 13 per cent of its species are adequately protected across their global range.”

“It isn’t just a case of wealthy nations losing their migratory birds to a lack of protection in poorer nations. Many Central American countries, for example, meet the targets for more than 75 per cent of their migratory species, but these same species have less protected area coverage in Canada and USA.”

While protected areas are generally designated by each nation, collaborative cross-border partnerships and inter-governmental coordination, as well as action are vital to safeguard the world’s migratory birds.

Prof. Fuller warned:

“It won’t matter what we do in Australia or in Europe if these birds are losing their habitat somewhere else – they will still perish. We need to work together far more effectively round the world if we want our migratory birds to survive into the future.”

Migrating birds take remarkable journeys, navigating thousands of miles across land and sea to make it to their winter homes. However, habitat loss along the way adds extra stress for some species--can you imagine flying all that way to find that everything at your destination has changed since last year? That is, more than 90 percent of migrating birds lack proper protection due to poorly coordinated conservation around the world, a new study revealed.

""More than half of migratory bird species travelling the world's main flyways have suffered serious population declines in the past 30 years. This is due mainly to unequal and ineffective protection across their migratory range and the places they stop to refuel along their routes,"" Dr. Claire Runge, lead author from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions (CEED) and the University of Queensland, explained in a news release.

In the study, recently published in Science, researchers highlight where there are major conservation gaps, specifically areas across China, India, and parts of Africa and South America. Based on their findings, researchers are calling for an international collaborative effort in order to properly protect the world's traveling birds, many of which are at risk of extinction.

Some of the birds they examined in their study include bar-tailed godwits and Arctic terns, which both clock flight miles equivalent to the distance to the moon and back, three times during their lives. Another example is the sooty shearwater that flies from the Falkland Islands to the Arctic, totaling 64,000 kilometers. What's more impressive is the tiny blackpoll warbler, which flies from Canada to South America over open ocean for three days straight.

In total, 1,324 of the world's 1,451 migrating bird species are inadequately protected along at least one part of their journey. Additionally, 18 species had no protection at all in their natural breeding habitats, two species had no protection at all throughout their entire migratory route, and three percent of the species listed as threatened under the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List are protected, researchers explained.

""And yet less than four percent of its range is protected, and almost none of its seasonal breeding areas in southern Brazil are covered.""

For their study researchers collected information on the movement of all migratory birds species at different times of the year, and compared this with maps of protect areas, such as national parks, in different habitat types, including wetlands, Arctic tundra, desert environments, savannas and forests.

When identifying the areas in most need of a conservation boost, researchers found over 8,200 locations that are internationally important for migratory birds, but only 22 percent of this area is completely protected, while 41 percent only partially overlaps with protected areas.

""Establishing new reserves to protect the unprotected sites -- and more effectively managing all protected areas for migratory species -- is critical to ensure the survival of these iconic species,"" Dr. Butchart said in the University of Queensland's news release.

Since migrating birds travel so widely, collaborative international partnerships will ensure that conservation measures taken at a bird's origin will pay off where it decides to rest for the winter.

It is not yet known if the birds, found Sunday near the All Souls’ Episcopal Church on Catalina Boulevard, died after being shot by pellet guns or if their deaths were due to other causes.

Necropsies on the birds were being performed Wednesday, said Dan DeSousa, Deputy Director of the County of San Diego Department of Animal Services.

After the birds were found, someone picked up the bodies and brought them to a nearby fire station, DeSousa said. He urged anyone who finds a dead bird to leave it where it is and instead, call the 24-hour animal services dispatch line at (619) 236-2341.

Necropsies on the birds were being performed Wednesday, said Dan DeSousa, Deputy Director of the County of San Diego Department of Animal Services.

After the birds were found, someone picked up the bodies and brought them to a nearby fire station, DeSousa said. He urged anyone who finds a dead bird to leave it where it is and instead, call the 24-hour animal services dispatch line at (619) 236-2341.

He said removing the bodies interferes with the department’s investigation.

According to SoCal Parrot, five parrots, including red-masked conures and a lilac-crowned amazon, died from injuries from projectiles between Feb. 19 and March 3. The first bird was found at Mariner’s Cove apartments on Point Loma Blvd.

The next three were discovered near the intersections of Gage Drive and Talbot Street and the fifth was found on Keats Street. It appears they were shot by two different weapons, a BB gun and a lead pellet gun, the organization said on its Facebook page.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for killing the birds.

41,"Campbell Island, the most southerly of New Zealand's subantarctic islands, lies about 700km south of Bluff. Successful rat eradication here has inspired similar efforts on islands around the world.

The Department of Conservation is aiming to remove mice from Antipodes Island this winter. SARAH-JANE O'CONNOR looks back at the eradication that paved the way 15 years ago.

The rats probably arrived on Campbell Island in 1828, when the sealing brig Perseverance was shipwrecked that October.

DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION A juvenile Campbell Island snipe. The sub-species was unknown to science until 1997. It recolonised Campbell Island after rats were eradicated in 2001.

By 1840, when the first naturalists arrived on the far-flung subantarctic island, the damage had already been done. Those aboard James Clark Ross's Erebus and Terror expedition had just been to the Auckland Islands and noticed Campbell was missing many of the land birds of the Aucklands.

They were right: there was a parakeet already extinct; a flightless duck banished to tiny islands offshore; a snipe similarly banished, not to be ""discovered"" by scientists until 1997.

In 2001, the Department of Conservation (DOC) tackled a job many thought was impossible: they rid Campbell Island of the norway rats that had pillaged the island for more than 150 years.

DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION Campbell Island teal, once probably rarer than kakapo, were reintroduced to Campbell Island after the 2001 rat eradication.

Pete McClelland was the project manager for the operation, which at the time was the biggest island eradication ever attempted.

""It was whole new ground,"" McClelland said. ""The largest eradication before had been Kapiti [Island] at about 2500 hectares and then suddenly we were drumming it up to 11,000 ha and also instead of operating 10km off the coast we were 700km off the coast.""

Until that point, island eradications using brodifacoum - an anticoagulant poison commonly sold in stores as Pestoff or Talon - used helicopters to make two bait drops, one of 8kg per hectare and the other of 4kg per ha. But the size of Campbell Island and the likely weather conditions in the region known as the Furious Fifties meant it could have taken six months to manage two bait applications.

So methods were tweaked and in the winter of 2001, after a successful test run, helicopters were flown down to distribute a single bait drop, at 6kg per ha Five years later, when monitoring had found no trace of rats, the eradication was declared a success.

Fifteen years on from the operation, some of the benefits from rat removal are confounded by sheep being taken off the island, starting in 1970 (they were a remnant of a failed attempt at farming). But McClelland said the regrowth in vegetation was remarkable compared to when he first visited Campbell Island in the late 1980s.

More directly, weta numbers increased, pipits and snipe recolonised from smaller rat-free islands nearby, grey-backed storm petrels and white-chinned petrels were recorded breeding for the first time after the rats were gone. By 2004, DOC was confident enough to reintroduce the Campbell Island teal, a flightless duck that had been taken from a nearby rat-free island and bred in captivity until the eradication had been completed.

DOC island eradication advisory group chairman Keith Broome said, for a species like the teal, the eradication ""sort of turned back the clock for them to the time before rats arrived on the island"".

""More or less they've come off the endangered species list as a consequence and, apart from making sure predators don't get back on Campbell, there's no further kind of action required, there's no further conservation spending on it.""

It was while teams were searching for more teal that they accidentally stumbled across the Campbell Island snipe on nearby Jacquemart Island. Though the 20ha island is only 1km away from Campbell Island, its steep cliffs mean hardly anyone has visited and then only briefly by helicopter.

Te Papa vertebrate curator Colin Miskelly helped describe and name the new snipe subspecies, which recolonised Campbell Island after the eradication without human intervention.

Miskelly said little was known about keeping snipe in captivity and there were likely too few birds to move from Jacquemart Island.

""We were fretting that if we caught some to move them, you're potentially wiping out the only natural population in the process and taking a gamble on whether they'd survive and breed where you're going to let them go. So it was a great relief when they did it themselves.""

McClelland said clearing Campbell Island of rats had a huge impact on other international eradication efforts.

""That opened up a whole new spectrum of other islands that could be considered and could be done. The Australians would never have done Macquarie [Island] if it hadn't been for Campbell, the Brits would never have tried South Georgia, the Yanks would not have done the Aleutians, they were all considered too hard to do until Campbell was successful.

""It started a new wave of eradications.""

With DOC preparing for an operation on Antipodes Island this winter in the hope of eradicating mice, McClelland said some people still struggled to believe an island could be freed of introduced mammals.

""The public still doesn't believe that you can get every rat off an island. Around your house you've always got mice coming in or rats coming in and you never get on top of them.

""There's something in the psyche that a lot of people just cannot understand how you can eradicate. They just don't believe that you can get something as small as rats, let alone mice, off an area of that size.

""So it's always great to prove them wrong.""",Plague of mice on subantarctic Antipodes Island may be living on borrowed time,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0dWZmLmNvLm56L3NjaWVuY2UvNzg3MDU4MTIvcGxhZ3VlLW9mLW1pY2Utb24tc3ViYW50YXJjdGljLWFudGlwb2Rlcy1pc2xhbmQtbWF5LWJlLWxpdmluZy1vbi1ib3Jyb3dlZC10aW1l0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/a/w/y/z/6/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1auxsk.png/1460673179302.jpg,2016-04-14,"{'sent': ""Campbell Island, the most southerly of New Zealand's subantarctic islands, lies about 700km south of Bluff."", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Bluff', 'Campbell Island', ""New Zealand's""], 'QUANTITY': ['about 700km']}}","Campbell Island, the most southerly of New Zealand's subantarctic islands, lies about 700km south of Bluff.

42,"A tortoise native to the Chihuahuan Desert of north-central Mexico was driven to near extinction by hunting and shifting weather patterns, but in just a few years it has revived and become a source of income and pride for some of the locals.

The Bolson tortoise, also known as the Mexican giant tortoise or by its scientific name, Gopherus flavomarginatus, was first identified by scientists in the 1950s after they witnessed a peculiar tortoise shell being used to feed chickens.

Locals had been consuming the tortoise for generations, preparing it with green or red chiles, cooked with tomato and onions, or dipping it in beaten eggs before cooking. Ernesto Herrera, 70, remembers that the animal’s egg chute, as prepared by his grandmother, was his favorite part.

For the people of the region, hunting for the tortoises, which can grow up to 50 centimeters in length and weigh up to 18 kilograms, was easier and cheaper than driving over 20 kilometers — a third of which remain unpaved to this day — to the nearest town to buy beef or pork.

Outsiders enjoyed the meat, too: people from nearby cities traveled to the small ejidos in the region to buy it for a few pesos.

In 1973 it was determined that the tortoises’ habitat was shrinking. By 1979 the 340,000-hectare Mapimí Biosphere Reserve was created in the state of Durango to protect the endangered tortoise and other unique flora and fauna of the Bolsón de Mapimí.

“We never considered that the animal could go extinct. We never gave it a second thought,” said Herrera.

It was during the last 15 years that staff from the National Protected Areas Commission (Conanp) began frequent visits to the region, but the locals didn’t understand biology, ecology or ecotourism, and would confront them and send them away.

Researchers found that cattle, the principal source of income for residents, compete with the Bolson tortoise for habitat and feeding grounds, which is the reason why each rancher is restricted to a controlled number of livestock.

Herrera says that cohabitation with the tortoises has been an educational experience. Aiding in their preservation efforts has also allowed the people of the ejidos to access federal funding for reforestation, monitoring and the upkeep of a small museum and tourist facilities.

Groups of up to 80 visitors arrive at the small ejido of La Flor, inhabited by 16 people. There, they learn to bake ranchero bread, take excursions to visit the tortoises’ burrows and nests, receive information about the preservation of the reptiles and, with luck, get to see a few of them.

Despite harsher weather conditions, the director of the biosphere reserve calculates that the population of the tortoises is stable at 10,000 specimens.

However, an organization whose goal is the preservation of threatened species of turtles and tortoises believes the Mapimí reserve is not enough because of agricultural activity within it. In response, the Turtle Conservancy has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase the 17,600-hectare Rancho San Ignacio and manage the land for the long-term protection of the Bolson tortoise.

The International Union for the Conservation of Nature ranks the tortoise as vulnerable to extinction on its conservation status scale.

A week’s B&B in a suite at Hotel Live Tulum, with flights but not transfers, costs from £695pp in June. Snorkelling excursions to the cenotes cost about US$50-70 through local outfits such as Akumal Dive Shop (akumaldiveshop.com) and Diving Cenotes Tulum (divingcenotestulum.com). Dives start at roughly US$100.

Madagascar, 2011

The stars of this show were lemurs, primates that are endemic to and synonymous with Madagascar. The film crew spent a month tracking one particular group of indiri lemurs, and filmed crowned lemurs moving amid the karsts of northern Madagascar. This series spawned a sequel: Attenborough and the Giant Egg, in which the presenter returns in search of the remains of eggs laid by long-extinct elephant birds.

How to do it: Kuoni (kuoni.co.uk) offers an 11-night Madagascar Explorer small group tour that takes in Isalo, Ranomafana and Mantadia national parks, all home to numerous species of lemur, as well as the scenic highlands and the island’s capital, Antananarivo. From £3,368pp including accommodation, most meals, transfers and guiding. International flights extra.

Frozen Planet, 2011

Filmed across both polar regions, this spectacular series centred around the changing seasons and the challenges faced by polar bears, Arctic wolves, Adelie penguins and wandering albatrosses.

How to do it: Explore the tundra of the Canadian Arctic – where part of the series was filmed – on Steppes Travel’s (steppestravel.co.uk) Classic Polar Bears group tour. From the small town of Churchill you’ll head out in specially adapted vehicles in search of the world’s largest bears, which flock here in their hundreds each autumn during their annual migration. You may also spot the Northern Lights. From £4,235pp including flights; departs October and November.

Galapagos 3D, 2013

The Sky series explored the Ecuadorian archipelago almost 200 years after Charles Darwin’s Beagle pulled ashore at the islands. It wast Attenborough’s fourth visit, during which time he encountered the Galapagos pink land iguana and the late Lonesome George, the last of the now extinct Pinta Island tortoises.

How to do it: Wildlife Worldwide (wildlifeworldwide.com) offers a number of specialist trips to the region, including the Five Day First Class Northern Galapagos cruiser, which visits some of the smaller islands including Santa Cruz and its flamingo-filled lagoons and sealions on Rabida. The group tour costs from £2,130pp excluding international flights.

Africa, 2013

The continent was explored in all its diversity, from the Atlas mountains to the Kalahari desert. The series took four years and 79 expeditions to film in 27 countries. Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park featured in the last episode as a case for considering the threats to Africa’s wildlife. The park’s ecosystems and wildlife have been successfully restored after being devastated by years of civil war and destructive farming policies.

How to do it: Cedarberg Travel (cedarberg-travel.com) offers a 10-day tour of Mozambique including three nights in Gorongosa from £2,900pp, including flights.

The Hunt, 2015

Taking in locations from the Arctic to Africa, this series examined the relationship between predator and prey, capturing the brutal reality of a kill.

How to do it: Part of the series was shot in Nsefu, in Zambia’s South Luangwa National Park, which can be visited with Expert Africa (expertafrica.com) on a seven-night safari. From £3,486pp including flights, transfers, full board accomodation, wildlife spotting and park fees.

Great Barrier Reef with David Attenborough, 2016

Attenborough has described his first time diving the Great Barrier Reef, in 1957, as “the most magical experience of my life”, and nearly 60 years later he returned, equipped with a submersible and a helicopter, to capture a unique perspective on the “rainforest of the sea”.

How to do it: Austravel (austravel.com) has a week-long Tropics and Tablelands itinerary that takes you round trip from Cairns, the gateway to the Reef, to diving hub Townsville. From £569pp including accommodation and car hire. Flights and excursions such as boat trips to the Reef are extra.",NA

To mark Endangered Species Day, Wildlife Watch looks at how crime jeopardizes seven animals facing extinction.

Ploughshare Tortoise: With its distinctive gold and black shells, this tortoise is vividly appealing—and now the rarest of its kind on Earth. Only about 500 ploughshares hold on in the forests of northwestern Madagascar. Hunted to supply the international pet trade, the creatures can fetch thousands of dollars on the international black market. Things are so bad that last year conservationists engraved some of the tortoises' shells with a serial number and the initials “MG” (for Madagascar) to ward off poachers.

Black Rhino: The smaller of the two African rhino species, the black rhino is in trouble in its East and Southern African range. That’s because poachers have killed so many, hacking off their horns to supply the illicit trade. Only about 5,000 black rhinos are left in the wild. Buyers in Vietnam and China—the main markets—view rhino horn as a status symbol and think it can cure everything from cancer to hangovers. It can’t: The horn consists of keratin, the same stuff in our nails and hair.

They become entangled in gill nets used to illegally catch totoaba, an endangered fish found in the Gulf of California whose swim bladder—the organ that helps it float—is coveted in China for soups and medicines. The vaquita is dangerously close to extinction—only 60 remain, the Mexican government announced last Friday.

Addax: Poachers don’t always kill endangered animals to make money. Sometimes, they're hunted for fun—like addaxes, an ethereal-looking Saharan antelope facing imminent extinction. Niger’s own military, assigned to protect oil workers in the heart of addax territory, have hunted the animals for sport in violation of the law, as did migrants fleeing Libya after the collapse of the Qaddafi regime in 2011. Researchers spotted a mere three addaxes during a survey of their habitat in March.

45,"A Deadhead paleontologist has honored Bob Weir by naming an extinct species of otter after the Grateful Dead guitarist. U.S. National Park Service paleontologist Kari Prassack identified the new species from a mislabeled specimen originally found in Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Idaho. She named the newly classified species Lontra weiri in honor of Weir.

Prassack, who attended over 100 Dead shows around the country between her first concert at age 15 in 1990 through the band’s final run in 1995, dated the otter fossil at over 3.8 million years old, making it the earliest known ancestor of the modern American river otter genus Lontra. Here’s a bit more on the discovery:

Lontra weiri represents the oldest known member of the otter genus Lontra. There are four species of this genus living today: the North American river otter and three species of South American river otter. The species designation (weiri) is in honor of Grateful Dead guitarist, Bob Weir. Fossils of Lontra are very uncommon in the fossil record. The oldest previously known fossils came from approximately 1.8 million years ago, during the Pleistocene epoch, and the genus was long thought to have evolved from an Asian Pleistocene otter. This conflicted with more recent genetic studies which place Lontra origins several million years earlier in the Pliocene epoch of North America. What paleontologists needed was to find an older fossil otter to support the genetic data. Hagerman’s new otter is at least 3.8 million years old and supports a Pliocene origin for New World otters … The newly identified otter fossils (a jaw bone and humerus) are housed at the Idaho Museum of Natural History, in Pocatello. They were collected, but not identified, over two decades ago by the museum, prior to the Hagerman Fossil Beds becoming a national monument. This find emphasizes the importance of preserving our country’s paleontological heritage and ensuring that our paleontological collections are accessible to the scientific community for study and for the public to learn from and enjoy.

“I have been a fan (deadhead) of the Grateful Dead for over 25 years,” Prassack told the Idaho Press-Tribune. “Traveling the country to see them play helped to instill my sense of adventure and gave me the confidence to pursue a career in paleontology. Naming this new species after Bob Weir seemed like a great way to say ‘thank you’, both to the Grateful Dead and to my Grateful Dead tour ‘family’ for being such an important part of my life.”

46,"Since the go-go era of the 1980s and 1990s when environmental protection was ignored in favor of economic development, Taiwan has improved its performance in protecting its environment and biodiversity. Waste disposal and pollution controls have become much stricter, and more than a million hectares of land and coastal areas are protected either in Taiwan’s nine national parks or its various ecological preserves. The more than 30% of Taiwan’s entire land area under such protection compares to just 14% of similarly protected area in the U.S.

Under the Wildlife Conservation Act nearly all hunting is prohibited save by aboriginals under special circumstances, and the ecologies and populations of many species have revived over the past two decades.

Biological diversity – or biodiversity –is the “variety within and between all species of plants, animals and micro-organisms and the ecosystems within which they live and interact,” as defined by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). While biodiversity is generally taken to mean the number of different species, the term also refers to genetic variety within a species, as well as ecological diversity, which looks at the network of different species present in local ecosystems and the dynamic interactions among them.

Taiwan and its surrounding waters are blessed with a large amount of biodiversity. The country’s location in the subtropical Western Pacific is one reason, as tropical areas have much higher biodiversity than temperate regions. Additionally, Taiwan’s extremes in altitude – the island goes from shallow coastal waters to steep mountains reaching nearly 4,000 m – creates a wide range of habitats that can support myriad life forms.

“In the United States very often if you drive two hours you will probably see either a desert or cornfield,” observes Eric Tsao (曹先紹), head of Taipei Zoo’s Conservation and Research Center. “But here in Taiwan you will probably find yourself traveling from a mountain top to the ocean. This is what we call biodiversity – habitat diversity. We should take advantage of that and not ruin it.”

Preservation of biodiversity is considered crucial to environmental sustainability, as each species and organism is interconnected and the loss of any single species can have unforeseen consequences. Scientists have so far identified between 1.4 and 1.8 million different species around the world, according to the WWF, and estimates of total numbers – including those not yet discovered – range from around two million to as many as 100 million species sharing the planet.

Many of these species go extinct naturally every year, but due to human-induced habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, and overhunting and fishing, current extinction rates are 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than natural rates. The loss of biodiversity could have significant impact on agriculture, fishing, medicine, and economies.

According to the Biodiversity Research Center at Taipei’s Academia Sinica, some 4,183 species of vertebrates (animals with backbones) inhabit Taiwan and its surrounding waters, including 2,945 species of bony fish, 186 species of cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays), 123 mammals, 717 birds, 130 reptiles, and 47 amphibians. Unsurprisingly for anyone who has spent any time in Taiwan’s beautiful outdoors, the island is home to a huge insect biodiversity, counting some 27,881 arthropods, which includes insects, spiders, centipedes, and their relations, and crustaceans such as crabs. Academia Sinica also lists a total of 8,681 species of plants, including 724 species of ferns.

Biodiversity is not limited to species that are visible, of course, and Taiwan’s humid, subtropical climate supports huge numbers of microorganisms, including hundreds of viruses, thousands of bacteria, and even six species of archaea, an ancient group of microorganisms.

Taiwan’s proximity to mainland Asia also contributes to greater biodiversity. Taiwan was connected to Asia by a land bridge as recently as 15,000 years ago when the oceans receded during the last ice age, allowing many species to migrate to the island. Subsequent adaptation and evolution over the millennia caused many divergences with mainland species, with the result that many species are considered endemic, or unique to Taiwan.

By contrast, the isolation of oceanic islands such as Hawaii results in lower overall levels of biodiversity but proportionately greater numbers of endemic species. According to the Council of Agriculture’s Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute, approximately 975 vascular plants are endemic to Taiwan, as well as 17 bird species, 27 reptiles, and 50 butterflies, with many more endemic subspecies.

Endemic species

One of the most famous endemic species in Taiwan is the iconic Formosan black bear, Taiwan’s largest carnivore, which inhabits the upper reaches of the mountains along with the endemic goat-like Formosan serow. Endemic Formosan macaques have become common in Taiwan’s lower elevations, and several species of bats are likewise endemic. The endemic Taiwan blue magpie is perhaps Taiwan’s most famous bird, along with Swinhoe’s pheasant and the Taiwan whistling thrush. Yet another example of an endemic species is the acclaimed Formosan landlocked salmon.

According to Shen Sheng-feng (沈聖峰) of the Biodiversity Research Institute at Academia Sinica, the number of endemic species in Taiwan is actually increasing, not because evolution is somehow speeding up, but because research into species is becoming more advanced and refined.

The term “species” denotes the most specific classification for a group of organisms, following from domain, phylum, class, order, family, and genus. Yet the definition of what actually constitutes a species has shifted over the years and still remains somewhat uncertain. Generally, “species” describes a group of individual organisms that interbreed in nature and produce viable offspring – essentially a gene pool. This definition is still problematic, however, as many single-celled organisms reproduce asexually, while many sexually reproductive species can interbreed with related species and producing viable hybrids. Differences between species may then come down to behavior or geography, and increasingly to genetics.

“In the past you determined differences based on morphology – color or shape,” explains Shen. “Now, though, you need to do molecular phylogeny.”

Molecular phylogeny is used to analyze differences in DNA sequences between different organisms to gain information on their evolutionary relationships. From such genetic analysis scientists have increasingly determined that Taiwanese species that might be related to those on the mainland are different enough to be classified as endemic to Taiwan. And whether a species is considered endemic or not can have profound consequences, as the case of the Taiwanese humpback dolphin illustrates.

The Chinese white dolphin (scientific name: Sousa chinensis), ranges widely throughout the coastal waters of the Western Pacific Ocean from northern China all the way to Australia. For years, scientists have debated whether the population that lives off the coast of Taiwan is distinct enough to be labeled a separate subspecies or even species. Finally, in 2015 a study of these dolphins’ morphology, behavior, and phylogeny published in the journal Zoological Studies concluded that “evidence strongly demonstrated that the Taiwanese humpback dolphin population is differentiated at the subspecies level and… is independent from that of dolphins from adjacent waters of mainland China.”

The Taiwanese humpbacked dolphin, also known as “Matsu’s fish,” is now identified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other scientific organizations by its new scientific name, Sousa chinensistaiwanensis.

The new identification allows the IUCN to consider this much smaller population separately from its more common cousin. The organization now categorizes the Taiwanese humpback dolphin as “Critically Endangered,” which will hopefully lead to stronger protection for the animals. Taiwan’s government has already limited coastal development in areas that Taiwanese humpback dolphins are known to frequent.

Not all species retreat in the face of development, as can be seen around the world in the increasing prevalence of urban wildlife. Several species of wildlife have reportedly become common even within the city limits of Taipei, including gem-faced civets, ferret-badgers, and muntjac (tiny barking deer). Sambar deer populations are likewise reportedly recovering in Taiwan’s high mountains, while wild boar and Formosan macaque populations have revived to the extent that they are considered agricultural pests.

Several wildlife biologists are even proposing reintroducing the clouded leopard to Taiwan’s southern mountains, arguing that reintroducing a magnificent apex predator to Taiwan’s environment would provide ecological balance to a restored ecosystem, much as the reintroduction of the Rocky Mountain wolf did in Yellowstone National Park in the United States. The idea has been met with guarded support in the wildlife biology and zoology community.

Despite these successes, many species in Taiwan continue to struggle to survive in a world increasingly dominated by human impacts. Tsao of the Taipei Zoo actively engages in local species conservation through the zoo’s wildlife rescue center, which has developed several innovative methods that are proving instrumental to preserving wildlife populations. Tsao is particularly proud of the Taipei Zoo’s success with Chinese pangolins, an endangered species that is notoriously difficult to keep in captivity.

These armored mammals resembling armadillos live in Taiwan’s low-lying hills where they are susceptible to habitat loss due to development as well as poaching (they are considered delicacies by many in the region). Breeding them in captivity is regarded as crucial to the survival of the eight species of pangolin living in Asia and Africa, but zoos were unable to replicate their diets of termites and ants until the Taipei Zoo found a way using honey bee pupae harvested from domestic hives. It now can not only successfully breed pangolins in captivity, but also keep rescued pangolins alive until they are well enough to return to the wild. The Taipei Zoo sends personnel around the world to train other zoos on its methods.

The study of biodiversity is in many ways the study of survival and reproduction, which offers important insights into the nature of life and even human behavior.

“Animal evolution has been happening for millions of years, and through all of this time animals have been struggling to survive between and within species,” observes John Wang, an American researcher at the Biodiversity Research Institute. “Basically you want your kid to survive. Collective and individual behavior – cooperation and conflict – always go hand in hand.”

According to the Biodiversity Research Center at Taipei’s Academia Sinica, some 4,183 species of vertebrates (animals with backbones) inhabit Taiwan and its surrounding waters, including 2,945 species of bony fish, 186 species of cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays), 123 mammals, 717 birds, 130 reptiles, and 47 amphibians. Unsurprisingly for anyone who has spent any time in Taiwan’s beautiful outdoors, the island is home to a huge insect biodiversity, counting some 27,881 arthropods, which includes insects, spiders, centipedes, and their relations, and crustaceans such as crabs. Academia Sinica also lists a total of 8,681 species of plants, including 724 species of ferns.

Biodiversity is not limited to species that are visible, of course, and Taiwan’s humid, subtropical climate supports huge numbers of microorganisms, including hundreds of viruses, thousands of bacteria, and even six species of archaea, an ancient group of microorganisms.

Taiwan’s proximity to mainland Asia also contributes to greater biodiversity. Taiwan was connected to Asia by a land bridge as recently as 15,000 years ago when the oceans receded during the last ice age, allowing many species to migrate to the island. Subsequent adaptation and evolution over the millennia caused many divergences with mainland species, with the result that many species are considered endemic, or unique to Taiwan.

By contrast, the isolation of oceanic islands such as Hawaii results in lower overall levels of biodiversity but proportionately greater numbers of endemic species. According to the Council of Agriculture’s Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute, approximately 975 vascular plants are endemic to Taiwan, as well as 17 bird species, 27 reptiles, and 50 butterflies, with many more endemic subspecies.

Endemic species

One of the most famous endemic species in Taiwan is the iconic Formosan black bear, Taiwan’s largest carnivore, which inhabits the upper reaches of the mountains along with the endemic goat-like Formosan serow. Endemic Formosan macaques have become common in Taiwan’s lower elevations, and several species of bats are likewise endemic. The endemic Taiwan blue magpie is perhaps Taiwan’s most famous bird, along with Swinhoe’s pheasant and the Taiwan whistling thrush. Yet another example of an endemic species is the acclaimed Formosan landlocked salmon.

According to Shen Sheng-feng (沈聖峰) of the Biodiversity Research Institute at Academia Sinica, the number of endemic species in Taiwan is actually increasing, not because evolution is somehow speeding up, but because research into species is becoming more advanced and refined.

The term “species” denotes the most specific classification for a group of organisms, following from domain, phylum, class, order, family, and genus. Yet the definition of what actually constitutes a species has shifted over the years and still remains somewhat uncertain. Generally, “species” describes a group of individual organisms that interbreed in nature and produce viable offspring – essentially a gene pool. This definition is still problematic, however, as many single-celled organisms reproduce asexually, while many sexually reproductive species can interbreed with related species and producing viable hybrids. Differences between species may then come down to behavior or geography, and increasingly to genetics.

“In the past you determined differences based on morphology – color or shape,” explains Shen. “Now, though, you need to do molecular phylogeny.”

Molecular phylogeny is used to analyze differences in DNA sequences between different organisms to gain information on their evolutionary relationships. From such genetic analysis scientists have increasingly determined that Taiwanese species that might be related to those on the mainland are different enough to be classified as endemic to Taiwan. And whether a species is considered endemic or not can have profound consequences, as the case of the Taiwanese humpback dolphin illustrates.

The Chinese white dolphin (scientific name: Sousa chinensis), ranges widely throughout the coastal waters of the Western Pacific Ocean from northern China all the way to Australia. For years, scientists have debated whether the population that lives off the coast of Taiwan is distinct enough to be labeled a separate subspecies or even species. Finally, in 2015 a study of these dolphins’ morphology, behavior, and phylogeny published in the journal Zoological Studies concluded that “evidence strongly demonstrated that the Taiwanese humpback dolphin population is differentiated at the subspecies level and… is independent from that of dolphins from adjacent waters of mainland China.”

The Taiwanese humpbacked dolphin, also known as “Matsu’s fish,” is now identified by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and other scientific organizations by its new scientific name, Sousa chinensistaiwanensis.

The new identification allows the IUCN to consider this much smaller population separately from its more common cousin. The organization now categorizes the Taiwanese humpback dolphin as “Critically Endangered,” which will hopefully lead to stronger protection for the animals. Taiwan’s government has already limited coastal development in areas that Taiwanese humpback dolphins are known to frequent.

Not all species retreat in the face of development, as can be seen around the world in the increasing prevalence of urban wildlife. Several species of wildlife have reportedly become common even within the city limits of Taipei, including gem-faced civets, ferret-badgers, and muntjac (tiny barking deer). Sambar deer populations are likewise reportedly recovering in Taiwan’s high mountains, while wild boar and Formosan macaque populations have revived to the extent that they are considered agricultural pests.

Several wildlife biologists are even proposing reintroducing the clouded leopard to Taiwan’s southern mountains, arguing that reintroducing a magnificent apex predator to Taiwan’s environment would provide ecological balance to a restored ecosystem, much as the reintroduction of the Rocky Mountain wolf did in Yellowstone National Park in the United States. The idea has been met with guarded support in the wildlife biology and zoology community.

Despite these successes, many species in Taiwan continue to struggle to survive in a world increasingly dominated by human impacts. Tsao of the Taipei Zoo actively engages in local species conservation through the zoo’s wildlife rescue center, which has developed several innovative methods that are proving instrumental to preserving wildlife populations. Tsao is particularly proud of the Taipei Zoo’s success with Chinese pangolins, an endangered species that is notoriously difficult to keep in captivity.

These armored mammals resembling armadillos live in Taiwan’s low-lying hills where they are susceptible to habitat loss due to development as well as poaching (they are considered delicacies by many in the region). Breeding them in captivity is regarded as crucial to the survival of the eight species of pangolin living in Asia and Africa, but zoos were unable to replicate their diets of termites and ants until the Taipei Zoo found a way using honey bee pupae harvested from domestic hives. It now can not only successfully breed pangolins in captivity, but also keep rescued pangolins alive until they are well enough to return to the wild. The Taipei Zoo sends personnel around the world to train other zoos on its methods.

The study of biodiversity is in many ways the study of survival and reproduction, which offers important insights into the nature of life and even human behavior.

“Animal evolution has been happening for millions of years, and through all of this time animals have been struggling to survive between and within species,” observes John Wang, an American researcher at the Biodiversity Research Institute. “Basically you want your kid to survive. Collective and individual behavior – cooperation and conflict – always go hand in hand.”

47,"How to stay ahead once the pressure sets in

By Sammy Bruce

Old Town, ME -(AmmoLand.com)- September is right around the corner, and skies are filling with waterfowl. And, although early season hunts occasionally involve uneducated birds willing to commit to any spread, rarely are things that easy.

It’s incredible how fast ducks and geese get wise to hunting pressure. A true credit to the resilience of nature, these birds often change daily patterns immediately with the first sign of hunting and become reluctant to land anywhere but in the neighborhood park.

Hunters can up their odds in a number of ways. Staying concealed is always the first order of business when waterfowl hunting, and accurate gunning is a key component to putting birds on the strap. But first, however, ducks and geese must buy what we’re selling, and decoys are central to this grand scheme of deception.

Along with good calling, it’s decoys that catch the attention of the birds we hunt. Moments later, the same decoys convince the birds to take a better look. And, in the end, it’s our decoys that bring our quarry, feet-down, into gun range.

Today’s blocks are the most realistic ever built, but there’s more to sealing the deal than seductive poses and pretty paint. The real key to decoy effectiveness isn’t their individual appearance; it’s their overall look.

The Look

We all want our decoys to look like real birds. Marty Dietz, a Minnesotan with a bad case of goose fever, says the best way to accomplish this is to record and study images of live birds.

“When scouting, take pictures of birds in the field you’re hunting,” he advises. “This allows you to see the numbers, locations and positions of individual birds.”

By basing his decoy spreads on his photos, Dietz knows he’s exactly mimicking the real thing.

Early season groups of geese usually contain numerous small family groups that often land and feed on their own. Decoy spreads should match, with small clumps of a half-dozen phonies spaced throughout a field.

This is the time of year when feeding is heaviest, as geese are hitting numerous food sources and packing on the pounds while the weather allows. For this reason, veteran goose hunter Dee Draper of Utah does all he can to match such feeding scenarios. He advises mimicking live birds in the area, and key observations help do so.

“A tighter spread indicates a lot of food, while an open and scattered spread indicates less.”

When representing heavily feeding birds, Draper recommends using a high proportion of feeding, head-down decoys.

The overall look of an individual decoy is largely determined by its design, manufacturing process and finish. These variables are, perhaps, most important in the early season.

“With a lot of sun in the early season, and the light dew around dawn, a painted decoy will shine as the sun comes up,” Draper claims.

This immediately educates honkers. For that reason, Draper and all other experts interviewed, rely on Avian-X fully flocked AXF Honker decoys.

Michigan’s Joe Robison, a waterfowl biologist-turned-hunter, agrees.

“On sunny days, fully flocked decoys absorb sunlight and appear more natural than painted versions. Avian-X decoys finish birds right in your lap… far better than any others I’ve tried.”

While the ultimate goal is to set your blocks on The X – that spot on the spot where birds always seem to want to land – that’s not always possible. When he can’t be right on the mark, Draper presents two other decoy rigs to fool birds.

The Loafing Rig

Big western river systems often congregate birds between feeding stops. Draper scores big in such locations by creating a resting-type atmosphere on a sand bar or island. Draper advises that, especially early in the season, geese like to drink and rest in areas just out of the water, and are often on low alert while doing so. Mimicking such mid-morning loafing activity often brings geese in on the first pass.

The Traffic Rig

The right decoy spread in the right location can cause passing geese to change their plans. Draper and his hunting companions often employ a traffic rig to bring in geese traveling between their roost and primary feeding grounds. Again, utilizing fully flocked decoys, Draper attempts to create a scenario mimicking a group of birds on a hot feed. To do so, he uses a larger number of tightly-spaced decoys. The spread employs mostly feeding poses along with a single, head-up sentry.

“An effective traffic rig portrays a lot of food,” says Draper.

Early Ducks

Geese aren’t the only game in town during the early season. To consistently score on teal, realistic decoy set-ups are just as crucial. While teal come and go quickly, they do so across the entire continent, and often see multiple decoy spreads in a single day. For these reasons, teal become educated extremely quickly, adding to their already jittery behavior.

Adam Campbell of Louisville, Kentucky gets his fair share of blue-wings in the late summer period, but does so by going against the grain, and matching the birds.

“I use Avian-X Early Season Teal decoys,” he states.

These blocks have an overall drab appearance to perfectly match September conditions.

“I tend to stay away from full plumage drakes, as we get mainly blue-winged teal, and the males are not in plumage.”

Campbell’s teal spread is meager in comparison to those of the honker hunters.

“I only use six to 12 decoys and a single spinning wing decoy,” he says.

Teal are generally suckers for motion, and the spinner helps draw them in from long distances. In jurisdictions where spinners are illegal, a jerk string can often be magic to teal that otherwise buzz around without committing.

Decoy placement is important, especially as it relates to shooting angles for each hunter in the blind. To maximize your take on teal, have as many barrels on them as possible once they get in close.

Dee Draper has it down to a science.

“I prefer to shoot finishing birds crossing, not facing,” says Draper, who does so by utilizing clumps of decoys, spaced with numerous landing holes in between.

He hunts from a crosswind set-up, so landing birds approach from left to right, or right to left, rather than directly towards Draper’s hiding area. This focuses the birds on the decoys, rather than on the hunters. Do it right, and as the birds settle into the landing zones, each member of the hunting party is presented with an easy shot directly in front, maximizing the barrel-to-bird ratio.

Novice waterfowl hunters imagine skies filled with stupid birds during the early season. Veterans, however, know the truth: Oftentimes, the jig is up by day two. To prolong opening-day success levels for weeks to come, take a lesson from the birds.

Focus on what’s most important to them. And remember, all eyes are on the decoys.

Kathmandu, November 16

Four new animal species have been recorded in Shivapuri-Nagarjun national Park that park lies in the capital city of the country.

After three years of continuous camera trapping from 2013 to 2015, wildlife experts found the Himalayan black bear, Himalayan ghoral, serow and civet for the first time in the history of Shivapuri-Nagarjun National Park.

According to expert Mukesh Kumar Chalise, the Himalayan black bear, Himalayan ghoral and Himalayan serow are found especially in the Himalayan region in and around mountain areas.

But those animals have been dramatically recorded in Shivapuri National Park situated in a hilly area.

“These four animal species have never been seen and snapped in Shivapuri area before,” he told The Himalayan Times, “Being an area near Langtang National Park, these species may have migrated to the downstream area or there may be other causes.” He said due to lack of research possible cause cannot be precisely stated.

He claimed that there was no photograph of serow snapped in Nepal yet and this is the first event where he succeeded in snapping it.

Under the leadership of Chalise a team of Nepal Biodiversity Society had conducted camera trapping for three years and all cameras were brought back from the spot in June this year.

Beside, large, medium and tiny palm civets have also been recorded. They were never recorded before in the park area though these species belong to the mid-hill areas.

Around 22 cameras were set at the field and research cost about Rs 1 million.

Chalise said detailed numerical results may take a few months as only row snaps and data are available right now.

Himalayan black bears are scattered across the Himalayas from Bhutan to Pakistan. They are most populous in mountainous areas and jungles.

Himalayan black bears have a black coat with a light brown muzzle and a pale yellow crescent on their chest. On average, they measure from 56 to 65 inches nose to tail and weigh from 200 to 265 pounds, though they may weigh as much as 400 pounds in the fall when they are fattening up for hibernation.

The Himalayan ghoral is a bovine species found across the Himalayas.

It is listed as near threatened on the IUCN red List because the population is thought to be declining significantly due to habitat loss and hunting for meat.

The illegal garment, on sale at a shop in Buxton, Derbyshire, was recovered on Wednesday in conjunction with the National Wildlife Crime Unit. Inquiries have identified the pelt used in the coat as being from the Geoffroy's cat, which has the highest level of protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

Confirming that the owner of the coat had been spoken to about the item, PC Emerson Buckingham said: ""Geoffroy's cats used to be widely hunted for their pelts, which were then made into garments and sold in the fur trade. ""When the cats were placed under the Cites scheme, that trade dropped off but we still see these kinds of furs, of many different prohibited species, being sold.

Confirming that the owner of the coat had been spoken to about the item, PC Emerson Buckingham said: ""Geoffroy's cats used to be widely hunted for their pelts, which were then made into garments and sold in the fur trade. ""When the cats were placed under the Cites scheme, that trade dropped off but we still see these kinds of furs, of many different prohibited species, being sold.

51,"Border wall would block animals as well as immigrants

President Donald Trump's much-ballyhooed border wall is aimed at stopping immigrants from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.

But, an unintended side-effect of a 2,000-mile border fence would be stopping migrations that have happened for thousands of years.

A variety of animals, from toads to jaguars to bears, regularly cross between Mexico and the United States. And, scientists worry that a large concrete and metal wall or fence would disrupt animal ranges and migrations in sometimes irreparable ways.

WALL IMPACT: Texas would be hardest hit by full border barrier

""You're basically making the Grand Canyon. You're effectively making like an ocean barrier here,"" said University of Texas integrative biology professor Tim Keitt. ""Nobody crosses the ocean.""

According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an impregnable wall running across the entire 2,000-mile border between the two countries would “potentially impact” more than 111 endangered species, 108 migratory bird species, four wildlife refuges and fish hatcheries and an unknown number of protected wetlands.

There's already about 800 miles of fencing along the Texas-Mexico border put up after the passage of the Secure Fence Act in 2006. That's cut off some animal migration routes.

A full border fence would take animals with limited ranges already and shrink those even further, Keitt said. The result would be two populations of animals - one north of the border and one south of the border - that would lose opportunities for diversity and gene dispersal, Keitt said.

REAL LIFE: There's already a border wall; Here's what life along it looks like

Potentially hurt the most would be small rodents, wild, amphibians and reptiles, Keitt said.

""It is important to ensure that animals have the ability to travel across wild landscapes,"" David Steen, assistant research professor at Auburn University Museum of Natural History, told The Dodo. ""Movement is important to maintain gene flow among populations and it can also help species recolonize areas where they've gone locally extinct.""

And, should climate change make it too warm for animals to stay further south or a drought strikes, a wall would stop migration north, Keitt said.

“That kind of a barrier could really impact some of the species,” Keitt said.

52,"A NATIONAL zoo inspectorate must be created to protect animals, the actress and wildlife campaigner Virginia McKenna has said after almost 500 animals died at Dalton Zoo.

The Born Free Foundation, the charity McKenna founded after she starred in the 1966 film Born Free, is also calling for a ban on importing elephants to the UK, The Times has reported.

The charity has produced a 15-point plan for improving the welfare of wild animals kept in captivity in the UK.



Virginia McKenna. Picture: Maria Slough Photography Born Free is calling for a full-time centralised zoo inspectorate. Licensing is currently handled by local authorities.

The charity wants the government to fulfil its manifesto pledge to ban wild animals in travelling circuses. It is also calling for a ban on selling or keeping primates as pets and a ban on the import, sale and keeping of wild-caught mammals, reptiles and amphibians as pets.

Zoos, it says, should lose the legal exemption that allows them to “pinion” birds, where their wings are cut to prevent flight.

McKenna, 85, said: ""We have fought tirelessly for 33 years for the millions of neglected, overlooked, unprotected, and mistreated wild animals kept in zoos, travelling circuses and as 'pets'.

""Yet significant problems remain on our doorstep here in the UK: it still remains legal to purchase and keep wild animals as pets, to repeatedly transport them for performance in travelling circuses, and it is shockingly clear that many zoos in the UK are substandard, failing to meet even meagre minimum requirements.

""Governments have the power to change this and they must take these issues seriously.""

The causes included emaciation, exposure and infighting within overstocked pens.

Staff from the Born Free Foundation - a charity that campaigns for the rights of captive animals - said they witnessed animals exhibiting 'stereotypic behaviour' when they visited Dalton Zoo.

The organisation was one of two to address members of Barrow Borough Council's licencing committee earlier this month on concerns for the welfare of animals kept at the attraction.

Katie Richards, of Born Free, urged the committee to reject an application for a zoo licence made by the site's owner David Gill.

Ms Richards said: ""I was appalled at the apparent mismanagement of the zoo and the animals.

""I am also deeply concerned Barrow Borough Council has allowed it to deteriorate over several years.

""There are fundamental issues that cannot be fixed by awarding a new zoo licence.""

South Lakes Safari Zoo is operating without a licence after Barrow Borough Council bosses refused to renew the existing permit held in the name of the attraction's owner, David Gill.

A formal closure notice was also issued by members of BBC's licencing regulatory committee after they ruled the zoo had failed to comply with a series of direction orders put in place last year.

However, the zoo can remain open for 28 days pending an appeal of the licence refusal by Mr Gill.

Unlike its boisterous cousin the long-tailed macaque, which can be found all across the island, the shy Raffles' banded langur is a lot more elusive.

There are fewer than 60 of these black-and-white monkeys in the wild in Singapore. This species is also found in Johor, but little is known about them there.

In August last year, WRS hosted a conservation strategy planning workshop for the Raffles' banded langur, which resulted in the first action plan to be formed to save the langur from extinction.

WRS supports local primatologist Andie Ang in implementing the plan.

Dr Ang is working with various stakeholders, including forestry officials and nature groups from Singapore and Malaysia.

She is also carrying out population, distribution and ecological studies and will propose measures to improve and protect what is left of the creature's habitats.

According to estimates, there are fewer than 300 tigers left in the wild across the Malaysian peninsula. WRS supports the Malaysian Conservation Alliance for Tigers (MyCAT), which monitors the Yu River wildlife corridor, an important link between Taman Negara National Park - which spans Pahang, Terengganu and Kelantan - and the Titiwangsa Mountains, home to the two largest tiger habitats in Malaysia.

With WRS' support, MyCAT is able to sustain regular anti-poaching patrols, known as CAT walks, which remove snares and baits and report encroachment by trespassers and poaching to the MyCAT-run Wildlife Crime Hotline.

Ornithologist Dr Miguel Gomez Garza and colleagues found the newly named blue-winged amazons while on a trip to a remote part of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico in 2014. Research then established it was a distinct species, based on its shape, colour pattern, call and behaviour.

Writing in the open-access journal PeerJ, researchers from the US, Mexico and Poland, who gave the bird the scientific name of Amazona gomezgarzai after its discoverer, described the features that made it a new species. Its calls were unique among parrots in Central America, while it is also the only one of the Amazona genus to have a green crown.

“A very distinctive feature … is its call, which is loud, sharp, short, repetitive and monotonous; one particular vocalisation is more reminiscent of an accipiter [a type of hawk] than of any parrot we know,” the researchers wrote. “In flight, the call is a loud, short, sharp and repetitive yak-yak-yak.”

While it was ""noisy and vocal"" in the air, when resting, the parrots appeared to use a friendlier call to keep in touch with members of their group. “It is generally secretive when resting, using its plumage as camouflage,” the researchers said. “While perched, the call is mellow and prolonged, sharper and more melodious than that of Amazona albifrons (the white-fronted amazon).

“Perched birds always respond to the call of another flock member, ensuring that the parrots always maintain contact with one another.”

It lives in small flocks of less than 12 birds with pairs and their offspring tending to stay together. Its behaviour was described as “more phlegmatic” compared to the “highly excitable and vocal” red-spectacled amazon.

56,"New Zealand now has a range of protected areas for indigenous wildlife and forest. Orokonui Ecosanctuary volunteer Alyth Grant reports on recent visits to several of them.

Do we do it best? As an Orokonui aficionado I am passionate about our ecosanctuary. Our successes in restoring our local ecosystem through plantings and translocations of rare birds back to their former Dunedin home make me proud.

But a winter visit to other parts of the country offered the chance to look at what others are doing.

In Auckland, Rotorua, Wellington and Nelson I saw wonderful projects, each with its own character.

Aucklanders are fortunate in the Auckland Regional Authority, which has established regional parks for the recreation of city-dwellers. Shakespear Regional Park and Tawharanui Regional Park are located on peninsulas about an hour’s drive north of the city, enhanced by that magnificent coastline. On both, a predator-deterrent fence has been built across a neck of land and the predators removed, allowing birdlife and regenerating forest to thrive.

They are open sanctuaries: open to visits by boaties, fishermen, walkers and picnickers. Drivers are asked to check their vehicles for pests before entering through the self-opening gates. There is therefore always a risk of reinvasion by pests, but volunteer support groups keep monitoring for them, just as they do at Orokonui. The land use is shared: adjacent to Shakespear is New Zealand Defence Force land, and on Tawharanui, tracks lead across farmland grazed by imperturbable cattle, while to the north is an extensive marine reserve.

Numbers of New Zealand dotterels feed and breed along the seashore at Okoromai Bay in Shakespear Regional Park.

Each park has lovely beaches. The brochure for Shakespear shows Okoromai Bay crowded with families at play. On a sunny winter’s day there were no people, only numerous dotterels skittering around on the water’s edge, evidence that humans and native species can co-exist.

At Tawharanui, reintroduction of several bird species has been carried out (robin, saddleback, whitehead, bellbird) but for some, such as kaka and kakariki, that hasn’t been necessary, as the birds just fly across the water from nearby Tiritiri Matangi Island in the Hauraki Gulf, treating these sanctuaries as an extension of their home turf.

Bellbirds aren’t as numerous as here in the South, and the North Island robin not as pretty, but oh, the saddlebacks! We sat down, reluctant to leave a beautiful patch of bush on Tawharanui, and suddenly, there was that distinctive call. Next moment five or six saddlebacks were darting around us in the undergrowth, feeding, and we watched one flutter in bursts up a tree trunk, poking its beak behind the bark in search of invertebrates, just as our rifleman do. A couple of weeks later I passed by a tree in Zealandia and saw it had little tears in the bark about 30cm apart in a vertical line up the trunk. I instantly knew what had caused it, for Zealandia, too, has a large population of saddlebacks.

What was most striking for me was the very different character of the bush in the north. Used to our mixed kanuka, broadleaf and podocarp forest, I gloried in the large-leaved species of that warmer zone: old puriri (vitex lucens), with massive trunk and root systems spreading out across a watercourse and even in winter still bearing a few pink flowers; kohekohe (dysoxylum spectabile), with occasional vestiges of its fragrant summer flowering still protruding here and there from its trunk; and the aromatic, heart-shaped leaves of kawakawa (macropiper excelsum), full of holes munched by the Looper moth caterpillar.

Puriri continue to flower all year round.

Visiting Zealandia again was like a halfway house back to Dunedin. The bush is more familiar, but includes some unfamiliar species, such as kawakawa and the large-leafed whau (entelea arborescens) with its prickly looking fruit capsules in winter. Zealandia’s birdlife is rich: while following the track around the upper lake looking for hihi I followed calls and found, not hihi, but a flock of whitehead, then saddleback, and suddenly a flight of kakariki, all at once! Evening there brings other pleasures. That is when the takahe and the eels are fed, and at dark patches along the tracks glow-worms twinkle. I was not lucky enough to see kiwi, but heard numerous calls. Even as I unlocked the car in the car park another called a farewell to me. How amazing is that, so close to the heart of the city!

Just across the harbour, reachable by ferry, lies Matiu-Somes Island, another predator-free island sanctuary; home to tuatara. After years of use as a quarantine station, it has been returned to its original Maori owners, but is managed for them by a resident Department of Conservation ranger. Careful inspection of bags and shoes is carried out on arrival.

Over the years Forest & Bird members have replanted much of the island and red-fronted kakariki are now abundant in the regenerating bush. These colourful parrots were constantly in evidence, flying up out of the bushes or off the track in front of me.

Each of these sanctuaries is unique to its region and offers insights into the diversity of our land. All are driven by people passionate about regaining what we once had everywhere. Some, like the new Brook-Waimarama project by Nelson, are on a large scale; others, like a remarkable riparian planting scheme I visited in Rotorua, are driven by just a few visionary individuals.

Sometimes I envied what other sanctuaries have to offer, yet as I walked Orokonui’s valley track alongside the rushing stream after the big rain recently, I was happy to be back in our own lush bush with its big rimu, its tiny, filmy ferns, and wet pongas sparkling in the sunlight filtering down through the trees. After all, conservation is not a competition: it is a necessity.

57,"Rare deer caught on film for first time in a decade

Farmers are now aware that hog deer do not pose a threat to rice crops.

Farmers are now aware that hog deer do not pose a threat to rice crops. Supplied

Four endangered hog deer have been recorded using camera traps for the first time in a decade in Kratie province, offering hope that the population of the species may be on the rise.

According to a WWF Cambodia statement issued yesterday, three adult females and one male were photographed in the evening and early morning using an automatically triggered camera placed in the core protection zone of a 2,678-hectare area.

“The nocturnal animals were seen grazing on rice saplings and vegetation,” the statement read. “The WWF-Cambodia research team has also found evidence of young hog deer footprints around the camera trap sites.”

WWF-Cambodia researcher Channa Phan said the rice field owner who reported the deer sightings was originally opposed to protecting the species but is now one of the many community members involved in either protecting camera traps or forming part of community patrol teams.

“The rice field owners are now aware of the fact hog deer do not destroy rice crops, are useful to the ecosystem, and can create opportunities for future eco-based tourism,” said Mr Channa.

He added the photos of female and male deer, plus juvenile footprint sightings, indicate that populations can be recovered.

Hog deer, listed as a globally endangered species on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature’s “Red List”, were thought to be extinct in Cambodia until 2006, when they were rediscovered in Kratie province.

However, the rare species has not been seen or photographed in the wild since then.

The main threats to the hog deer include hunting and snaring for bush meat consumption, habitat loss, charcoal production, and land clearance for agriculture.

WWF-Cambodia country director Seng Teak said the sightings were fabulous news and clearly reflect the hard work of community members, as well as the joint effort between government and WWF field teams over the last few years.

“However, hunting pressure remains a challenge and we must eliminate it via close collaboration with communities, increasing our boots on the ground, and implementing effective law enforcement,” Mr Teak

59,"Rainforest Trust and partners Habio, A.C. and the Turtle Conservancy have purchased the 43,243-acre privately-owned Rancho San Ignacio to establish the Mexican Bolson Tortoise Preserve, a key site that falls within the globally recognized Mapimi Biosphere Reserve. Its flat desert floor is punctuated by a series of small mountains and hosts a globally important Bolson Tortoise population that was under extreme threat from habitat loss, encroachment from cattle herders and industrial-scale agriculture.

Designated in 1977, the Mapimi Biosphere Reserve aimed to highlight the importance of both the Bolson Tortoise and the unique remnant of the Chihuahuan Desert grassland ecosystem that it occupies. The area is not only important for the Bolson Tortoise, but also 200 species of birds, 39 reptiles, 28 mammals and five amphibians. This area was among the first biosphere reserves designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Latin America. Unlike formal protected areas, UNESCO sites represent an area of global significance and often do not come with specific legal protection. For this reason, many Biosphere Reserves are provided additional legal protection. In the case of the Mapimi Biosphere Reserve, the aim was to add to the global recognition by ensuring a core, fully protected area at the center of the reserve, thereby providing a global stronghold for the tortoise.

The Bolson Tortoise is the largest tortoise species in North America and can grow to be around 18 inches in length. Based on the fossil record, its range once extended as far north as south-western Arizona and Oklahoma in the U.S., but today the most significant populations are limited to an area around the new Mexican Bolson Tortoise Preserve and broader Mapimi Biosphere Reserve. While the Bolson Tortoise population within the limits of the reserve is recovering from drastic exploitation in the mid-20th century, it is still threatened throughout the rest of its range.

“The Bolson Tortoise really is an incredible species, and being able to contribute to its survival is very important to us at Rainforest Trust,”

said James Lewis, Rainforest Trust Director of Conservation Programs. “The Bolson Tortoise clearly would have had a significant impact on the ecosystems that it lived within, and hopefully we will slowly see this positive impact return as populations grow in the Bolson Tortoise Preserve and slowly spill out into the broader Biosphere Reserve. As is key with so many of the protected areas that Rainforest Trust helps to create, the Bolson Tortoise Preserve will be managed in such a way that ensures its long term success by working alongside local institutions and communities.”

The support of our generous friends around the world and the SAVES Challenge made this project a success. A special thank you to Rainforest Trust Board Member Eric Goode for his leadership gift.

The morning walkers in Naintal were awestruck to see a Himalayan serow — scientific name Capricornis Thar — wandering on the town streets on Monday.

The news spread like a wildfire in the sleepy town. A large number of people gathered to see the animal. It was no less than a drama then, as the deer stood idle on a slope in the Sher Ka Danda area in the cold morning, many people clicked its photographs. Some youngsters even tried to take remote selfie with the animal. When some dogs tried to chase the animal, the deer scared them away with its horns.

Mahindra Pal, a senior advocate who saw the animal being chased by the street dogs, informed the forest department. After an hour of drama, the forest department employees arrived and shooed away the animal to the woods.

“We tried to rescue the deer, but it was too aggressive,” said Hira Singh Shahi, a forester. “The deer was perhaps eight years old. The animal falls under the Schedule 1 of the extinct species list,” he said.

Dharam Singh Meena, district forest officer, said Himalayan serows are found in the outer forests around Nainital. “The instances of such animals venturing into the town area happen because they are attracted to leftover food and garbage in the city,” he said.

It is not an isolated incident of an animal straying into the town. In the past, a black Himalayan bear strayed into the town in July 2016, swam across the Naini lake and then headed towards forest. In the same month, a young leopard entered a hotel room, where a couple was resting.

Facebook is a handy social media platform for keeping touch with friends and relatives and for keeping abreast of developments. Sadly, the site has also become a convenient tool for wildlife traffickers to reach an ever wider pool of potential buyers for their ill-gotten fare.

This has long been the case in Malaysia, where wildlife traffickers have resorted to selling rare, “exotic” and endangered species on social media. Over a year ago the anti-trafficking watchdog TRAFFIC revealed that the hugely popular social media platform has become a hot bed in countries like Malaysia and Vietnam for the illegal trade in protected species as part of a booming exotic pet trade conducted online.

Sadly, the situation is just as bad in several other countries as well in Southeast Asia. A case in point is the Philippines. TRAFFIC says that within a few weeks between June and August in 2015 more than 5,000 reptiles from 115 species were offered for sale in 90 Facebook groups. Everything from critically endangered crocodiles to rare tortoises is being peddled on the site with impunity as the social media giant has done little to address the problem effectively, the NGO says.

“This magnitude of commerce in live wild animals online is just mind boggling,” says Serene Chng, program officer for TRAFFIC in Southeast Asia. “This small snapshot reinforces how social media has taken over as the new epicentre of [the] wildlife trade.”

Among the species on sale, during the period of study, were the endemic and critically endangered Philippine crocodile (Crocodylus mindorensis) and the Philippine forest turtle (Siebenrockiella leytensis). Also on sale were several CITES Appendix I-listed non-native species, including radiated tortoises (Astrochelys radiate), Bengal monitor lizards (Varanus bengalensis), black spotted turtles (Geochlemys hamiltonii) and Dumeril’s boa (Acrantophis dumerili). All these foreign animals appear to have been smuggled illegally into the country.

“Facebook is the platform of choice for illegal traders in the Philippines because of its popularity and insufficient internal monitoring enforcement,” TRAFFIC says. Buyers and sellers use “internet-based services to ensure privacy and connectivity,” the NGO adds. “Most deals were closed via Facebook messenger, away from any prying eyes, making it difficult for effective monitoring of illicit online activity. At least [in] one case a trader was documented using a ride-sharing service to deliver wildlife to a buyer.”

62,"Uninhabited islands in New Zealand, such as Tiritiri Matangi, are offering wildlife the protection they need to thrive.

Just hop on a 75-minute ferry ride from downtown Auckland, New Zealand and you will end up on an unspoiled island home to 87 different species of birds. Tiritiri Matangi is one of several of New Zealand’s offshore islands that has become a wildlife sanctuary, offering predator-free habitat where threatened native species can have a chance to rebound. This uninhabited island is one of two still open to the public and represents the benefits restoration can have on an ecosystem.

Tiritiri Matangi was established as a wildlife sanctuary in response to the introduction of invasive species to New Zealand. For native birds, this conservation measure came as a welcome relief. Many native New Zealand birds do not fly and therefore cannot easily escape predators that have been introduced by humans. But why would there be birds that can’t fly in the first place? The answer has to do with the way New Zealand was formed.

Before New Zealand existed the earth was a supercontinent—a formation known as “Gondwanaland.” Eventually this continent was broken apart by tectonic activity, and New Zealand split off before mammals arrived on the scene. Birds had the island to themselves and for millions of years, they evolved in the absence of land predators. Their most significant predators were falcons and Swamp Harriers that would swoop down from the sky to grab them. The birds learned that the best way to avoid being eaten was to sit still against the ground; over time, the birds were flying less in favor of the safer option of scuttling among island vegetation.

This strategy worked well until the Māori arrived along with novel predators. Once invasive rats and feral dogs began to make their homes on the island, the native birds’ tactic of sitting quietly on the ground was not going to work anymore. This wasn’t the full extent of the damage–more was soon to come.

Next came the Europeans, who brought with them cats, ferrets, and stoats, which further altered the ecosystem dynamics. The presence of invasive species brought down native species populations and forced native birds to retreat into remote mountain valleys or offshore islands to avoid predation. Species like the North Island Saddleback took dramatic hits; for this species, the population was reduced to 500, all on Hen Island.

Luckily people began to notice the destruction unfolding and the urgent need for conservation measures. Thomas Potts, a naturalist from Dunedin, proposed initiating island sanctuaries for at risk species in the 1870s. The first permanent refuge was set up in 1895 on Little Barrier Island. This island is now home to the Little Spotted Kiwi, the Red Crowned Parakeet, the Fantail, the Stitchbird and many more native New Zealand Birds.

Tiritiri Matangi has come a long way in just 30 years. It was once barren; it had been a farm so most of the natural vegetation had been removed and replaced. From 1984-94 thousands of volunteers planted 283,000 trees on the island. The re-vegetation was very successful; native flora such as Red-flowering Pohutukawas and Flax plants now cover the island.

The next conservation intervention was the eradication of the invasive Polynesian Rat in 1993 from Tiritiri Matangi. the invasive rodent was destroying seedlings and competing with native birds for food. Today, New Zealand has proposed Predator Free 2050, an ambitious conservation project: with a first goal of eradicating all of the island nation’s nature reserves of invasive predators by 2025. Tiritiri Matangi already has a head start since it is largely free of invasive species.

The results from turning offshore uninhabited islands in New Zealand into wildlife sanctuaries have been extraordinary. Tiritiri Matangi Island has turned into one of the few unspoiled wildlife sanctuaries where native birds can recover. Birds such as the Takahē, a bird so rare it was thought to be extinct, can today be seen strutting around on the island. This is a sign of hope that threatened species can recover if given the proper protection, and highlights the importance of invasive-free island ecosystems for extinction prevention efforts.

63,"Bioinspired soft machines made of highly deformable materials are enabling a variety of innovative applications, yet their locomotion typically requires several actuators that are independently activated. We harnessed kirigami principles to significantly enhance the crawling capability of a soft actuator. We designed highly stretchable kirigami surfaces in which mechanical instabilities induce a transformation from flat sheets to 3D-textured surfaces akin to the scaled skin of snakes. First, we showed that this transformation was accompanied by a dramatic change in the frictional properties of the surfaces. Then, we demonstrated that, when wrapped around an extending soft actuator, the buckling-induced directional frictional properties of these surfaces enabled the system to efficiently crawl.

( A ) We considered a fiber-reinforced elastomeric soft actuator that extends axially upon inflation. ( B ) A kirigami skin was fabricated by embedding an array of cuts into a thin plastic sheet. ( C ) A kirigami-skinned soft crawler was built by wrapping the kirigami skin around the actuator. ( D ) Cross-sectional view of a kirigami-skinned soft crawler. ( E ) Inflation of the actuator resulted in a buckling-induced pop-up texture similar to that of a snake’s skin. Inset: A typical volume-control actuation protocol with a maximum volume V max . ( F ) Close-up views of a kirigami skin with triangular cuts at a different level of supplied volume V (note that V max = 24 ml is the maximum supplied volume). ( G ) Snapshots showing the rectilinear gait of a female Dumeril’s boa (Acrantophis dumerili). The snake actively tilts the ventral scales to increase frictional anisotropy and enhance anchoring (video courtesy of H. Marvi and D. Hu).

Inspired by the friction-assisted locomotion of snakes ( 1 , 5 , 7 ) and by the recent advances in engineered surfaces with programmable tribological behavior ( 22 – 25 ), we introduce here a smart and flexible skin with anisotropic frictional properties that enables a single soft actuator to propel itself. To this end, we took advantage of kirigami, the ancient Japanese art of paper cutting, whose principles have recently emerged as promising tools to realize highly stretchable and morphable structures ( 26 – 29 ). We realized the skin by embedding an array of properly designed cuts into a planar plastic sheet ( Fig. 1A ) and then wrapping it around a soft actuator (see Fig. 1 , B to D). Upon inflation, the elongation of the actuator triggered a mechanical instability in the kirigami skin that in turn induced the pop-up of a three-dimensional (3D) morphology similar to that of a snake’s skin ( Fig. 1 , E and F). The highly directional 3D features induced by buckling significantly altered the frictional properties of the kirigami skins and enabled our simple machine to move forward. The buckling-induced pop-up process observed in our kirigami skin resembles the ability of the snakes to actively actuate their scales ( Fig. 1F and movie S1) to tune their frictional properties ( 5 ).

The flexibility of soft-bodied animals has recently inspired the design of new class of soft robots that are easy and inexpensive to fabricate yet still can achieve complex motions ( 10 – 14 ). However, efforts to replicate natural frictional properties in synthetic systems have been limited ( 15 , 16 ). The skin of the vast majority of soft robots consists of an unstructured flexible membrane that lacks directional frictional properties. As a result, multiple actuators activated independently are typically required to achieve locomotion ( 16 – 21 ).

Nature offers many examples of slender limbless organisms that take advantage of both the flexibility of their body and the frictional properties of their skin to efficiently move and explore the surrounding space ( 1 – 5 ). For example, snakes rely on the substantial reconfiguration in the shape of their body ( 6 ) and on the frictional anisotropy of their skin ( 7 ) to propel themselves. Not only microscopic features ( 8 , 9 ) but also the macroscale structure and arrangement of their ventral scales contribute to such anisotropic friction ( 5 ), because their preferred orientation makes sliding in the forward direction much easier than in the backward one.

RESULTS

We considered a soft fluidic actuator comprising an elastomeric tube made of silicone rubber (Smooth-On Inc., Ecoflex 00-30; shear modulus μ a ≃ 30 kPa) with a length of 164 mm and a triangular cross section with edges of 25 mm (see Fig. 1, B and C). To maximize its elongation during inflation and constrain any other mode of deformation, we surrounded the tube with stiff Kevlar fibers arranged in a helical pattern with small pitch (so that the fibers were almost aligned with the circumferential direction—see the Supplementary Materials for details). We found that the actuator extended by 25% when inflated with a maximum volume of V max = 24 ml of air. However, because symmetry resulted in equal movements of both actuator ends during inflation and deflation, this system did not move forward when placed on a substrate (see movie S2).

Next, we covered the actuator with kirigami skins (see Fig. 1D and movie S3) and investigated their effect on its ability to move. Our kirigami skins were fabricated by laser cutting 9 by 32 centimeter-scale unit cells arranged on a triangular lattice with spacing of l = 4.5 mm and hinge width of δ = 0.7 mm into polyester plastic sheets (Artus Corporation; Young’s modulus of E = 4.33 GPa, see fig. S2). Inspired by the shapes observed in ventral scales of snakes (22), we considered four different cuts (see Fig. 2A): (i) linear cuts, (ii) triangular cuts, (iii) circular cuts, and (iv) trapezoidal cuts. For all assembled kirigami-skinned crawlers, we first characterized their elongation (ε) and pressure (P) as a function of the supplied volume (V) and then investigated how inflation affected the frictional force when they moved on a substrate. To this end, we pulled (i.e., moved backward) and pushed (i.e., moved forward) the crawlers inflated by different amounts of air against a rough surface (polyurethane foam) while monitoring the resistive force (F fr ). Effective coefficients of friction in backward (μ b ) and forward (μ f ) directions were then extracted from these measurements as (1)where F N ≃ 0.2 N is the crawler’s weight, 〈 ⋅ 〉 denotes the mean value, and and are the local peaks of F fr recorded during pulling and pushing, respectively (see the Supplementary Materials for details).

Insets: 3D-scanned surface profiles of the skins at the supplied volume V/V max = 1.

Although the pattern with linear cuts has been used frequently to design highly stretchable systems (26, 29), we found that the corresponding kirigami skin severely limited the extensibility of the actuator [i.e., ε = (L − L 0 )/L 0 < 0.05, L 0 , and L denoting the undeformed and deformed lengths of the perforated part of the skin (Fig. 2B)] and made it very stiff (see Fig. 2C). This is because the antisymmetric out-of-plane buckling mode typical of this kirigami sheet is characterized by alternating up and down (see fig. S6B) buckled ligaments (26) and therefore is suppressed by the presence of the actuator. Hence, no features pop up upon inflation (see inset in Fig. 2F), the crawler slides smoothly in both directions, and the frictional force recorded during pulling and pushing reaches similar values, which are not affected by the supplied volume V (see red lines in Fig. 2, D and E), yielding μ f (V) ≃ μ b (V) ≃ 0.75 − 1 (see Fig. 2F).

By contrast, we found that the other three skins only moderately limited the extensibility of the soft actuator (i.e., ε ≃ 0.12 ~ 0.18, see Fig. 2B) and resulted in a pressure-elongation curve characterized by an initial linear regime, a pressure plateau, and a final stiffening. While in the initial linear regime, all hinges bent in-plane, and the skins remained flat; the sudden departure from linearity to a plateau stress was caused by the out-of-plane buckling of the hinges, which induced the formation of a 3D pattern similar to that of a snake’s skin with all features homogeneously popping outward (see insets in Fig. 2, G to I, and fig. S8). This buckling-induced pop-up significantly altered the measured frictional force. Before the instability (i.e., for supplied volume ratios V/V max < 0.25), the crawlers slid smoothly in both forward and backward directions, and μ b ≃ μ f ≃ 1 ~ 1.5 for all three systems (the slight increase in μ b and μ f compared to the case of the skin with linear cuts was due to the sharper features of the cuts). However, above the instability threshold (i.e., for supplied volume ratios V/V max > 0.25), the popping out of the features defined by the cuts led to a jerking motion in backward direction, with the crawlers that alternatively stuck to the substrate and slid over it. This stick-slip regime was also apparent from the measured frictional force, which presented a discrete sequence of sharp drops (see Fig. 2E). Moreover, the instability-induced pop-up process resulted in a significant increase of the magnitude of F fr measured during pulling (see Fig. 2E) so that μ b >> μ f for supplied volume ratios V/V max > 0.25. Therefore, our results indicate that buckling can be exploited to transform the frictional properties of a surface from isotropic to highly anisotropic. However, for this transformation to happen, it is necessary that all features pop up in the same direction (i.e., toward the crawlers’ tail). To demonstrate this important point, we considered a kirigami skin with half of the triangular cuts pointing to the head of the crawler and the remaining pointing to its tail (we refer to this pattern as the mirrored triangular pattern). In this case, buckling triggered a pop-up process, and the symmetry of the resulting 3D pattern induced a significant increase of both μ f and μ b and did not introduce any frictional directionality (i.e., μ b ~ μ f , see fig. S6C).

Having characterized the tribological behavior of our kirigami-skinned crawlers, we then investigated how friction affected their ability to crawl. To this end, we monitored the position of the crawlers placed on a rough surface (polyurethane foam) as they were inflated by supplying a volume of air V max = 24 ml and deflated by extracting the same amount of fluid at a rate of 300 ml/min (see movie S4). In Fig. 3A, we overlay initial and final positions of the crawlers after six inflation cycles, whereas in Fig. 3B, we report the evolution of the displacement of their centers of mass (solid lines), tails (dashed lines), and heads (dotted lines). These results indicate that the crawlers with kirigami skins exhibiting directional frictional properties (i.e., those with circular, triangular, and trapezoidal cuts) were capable of propelling themselves much more efficiently than the other ones. Specifically, if we indicated with u cycle , the displacement recorded at the end of each cycle, then we found that u cycle /L 0 = 0, 0.015, 0.068, 0.08, and 0.12 for the kirigami-skinned crawlers with linear, mirrored triangular, triangular, circular, and trapezoidal cuts, respectively. Although the poor performance of the kirigami-skinned crawler with linear cuts can be attributed to its very limited extensibility, the very short distance traveled by the crawler with the mirrored triangular cuts points to the importance of the anisotropic frictional properties introduced by the buckled kirigami skins. Last, we note that the efficiency of our kirigami-skinned crawlers with anisotropic frictional properties (i.e., those with triangular, circular, and trapezoidal cuts) was mainly determined by the stretchability of their skin. The skin with trapezoidal cuts was more stretchable than those with circular and triangular cuts and, therefore, enabled the crawler to have a longer stride and move further.

Error bars indicate SD of the measured anchor points during six inflation/deflation cycles.

To further understand how the frictional properties of our kirigami skins affect locomotion, we focused on the position of the anchor point (x a ) at which the crawlers gripped the substrate (i.e., the instantaneous stagnation point along the crawler body) to pull themselves forward and prevent backward sliding (6). By balancing the frictional forces exerted by the substrate on the skin (while neglecting inertial forces due to the slow nature of the crawling motion), we show that (see the Supplementary Materials for details) (2)which provides explicit relations between the position of the anchor point and the frictional properties of the kirigami skin. Equation 2 indicates that, to maximize the distance traveled by the crawlers, the ratio μ b /μ f should be as large as possible. In this case, x a /L approaches ±0.5, and anchoring occurs at the tail during inflation/elongation and at the head during deflation/shortening, completely preventing backward sliding. Moreover, Eq. 2 also shows that for μ b ~ μ f , the anchor point is located at the center of mass of the crawlers (i.e., x a /L ~ 0). In this case, the head and tail of the crawlers move by the same amount (but in opposite directions) during inflation and deflation, and there is no advancement. In Fig. 3C, we compared the position of the anchor point extracted by our tests with that predicted by Eq. 2 using the experimentally measured friction coefficients reported in Fig. 2 (F to I). We found that the trends observed in our experiments are well captured by our simple model. When the kirigami skin has isotropic frictional properties (as for the patterns with mirrored triangular cuts during the entire inflation/deflation process and with circular, triangular, and trapezoidal cuts before buckling), then x a /L is about 0. By contrast, if μ b >> μ f (as for the skins with triangular, circular, and trapezoidal cuts after buckling), then the anchor point moves toward the tail and the head of the crawler during inflation and deflation, respectively.

The results reported in Fig. 3 (A to C) show that, by taking advantage of the directional frictional properties induced in the kirigami skins by buckling, even a single soft actuator can propel itself. They also indicate that the conditions used in our experiments were not optimal, because even for our best kirigami-skinned crawlers, the anchor points were located near their centers of mass for volume ratios V/V max < 0.25. This limitation can be overcome by not fully deflating the actuators so that they always operate in the region where the skin has anisotropic frictional properties. In Fig. 3E, we report the measured (markers) and predicted (continuous lines) total displacement (u tot ) when a total volume V tot = 120 ml of air was supplied by cyclically inflating and deflating them between the maximum volume V max = 24 ml and the minimum volume V min ∈ [0,V max ] (see movie S5 and the Supplementary Materials for details). We found that there is an optimum value of the minimum volume V min for which the crawlers move more efficiently. Whereas for smaller values of the minimum volume V min, the lack of anisotropic frictional properties resulted in smaller total displacement u tot , when V min was increased above the optimum value, the limited change in length experienced by the crawlers during the cycles became the limiting factor.

To date, we have considered kirigami skins that were initially flat and in which buckling induced the reversible and repeatable formation of a 3D directional texture, but plastic deformation at the ligaments can also be harnessed to generate a permanent 3D morphology (28) and, therefore, to improve the efficiency of the crawlers. To demonstrate this, we considered a kirigami skin with triangular cuts, and before wrapping it around the actuators, we applied a large stretch so that in the post-buckling regime, plastic strains developed in the ligament between the cuts, creating a permanent pop-up pattern (see insets of Fig. 3E). We found that this plastically deformed skin affected the response of the system in two ways. On the one hand, it increased the elongation that the crawler experienced at the beginning of the inflation process (Fig. 3E). On the other hand, its permanent directional texture resulted in highly anisotropic frictional properties through the entire actuation process (Fig. 3F). Hence, the efficiency in locomotion for this crawler was optimal when the supplied volume was cyclically varied between 0 and 12 ml (Fig. 3G), resulting in ~22% improvement in comparison to the best performance of the corresponding crawler with a purely elastic kirigami skin.",Kirigami skins make a simple soft actuator crawl,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vcm9ib3RpY3Muc2NpZW5jZW1hZy5vcmcvY29udGVudC8zLzE1L2VhYXI3NTU1LmZ1bGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/3/15/eaar7555/F1.large.jpg,2018-02-21,"{'sent': 'We harnessed kirigami principles to significantly enhance the crawling capability of a soft actuator.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['kirigami']}}","Bioinspired soft machines made of highly deformable materials are enabling a variety of innovative applications, yet their locomotion typically requires several actuators that are independently activated. We harnessed kirigami principles to significantly enhance the crawling capability of a soft actuator. We designed highly stretchable kirigami surfaces in which mechanical instabilities induce a transformation from flat sheets to 3D-textured surfaces akin to the scaled skin of snakes. First, we showed that this transformation was accompanied by a dramatic change in the frictional properties of the surfaces. Then, we demonstrated that, when wrapped around an extending soft actuator, the buckling-induced directional frictional properties of these surfaces enabled the system to efficiently crawl.

The snake actively tilts the ventral scales to increase frictional anisotropy and enhance anchoring (video courtesy of H. Marvi and D. Hu).

Inspired by the friction-assisted locomotion of snakes ( 1 , 5 , 7 ) and by the recent advances in engineered surfaces with programmable tribological behavior ( 22 – 25 ), we introduce here a smart and flexible skin with anisotropic frictional properties that enables a single soft actuator to propel itself. To this end, we took advantage of kirigami, the ancient Japanese art of paper cutting, whose principles have recently emerged as promising tools to realize highly stretchable and morphable structures ( 26 – 29 ). We realized the skin by embedding an array of properly designed cuts into a planar plastic sheet ( Fig. 1A ) and then wrapping it around a soft actuator (see Fig. 1 , B to D). Upon inflation, the elongation of the actuator triggered a mechanical instability in the kirigami skin that in turn induced the pop-up of a three-dimensional (3D) morphology similar to that of a snake’s skin ( Fig. 1 , E and F). The highly directional 3D features induced by buckling significantly altered the frictional properties of the kirigami skins and enabled our simple machine to move forward. The buckling-induced pop-up process observed in our kirigami skin resembles the ability of the snakes to actively actuate their scales ( Fig. 1F and movie S1) to tune their frictional properties ( 5 ).

The flexibility of soft-bodied animals has recently inspired the design of new class of soft robots that are easy and inexpensive to fabricate yet still can achieve complex motions ( 10 – 14 ). However, efforts to replicate natural frictional properties in synthetic systems have been limited ( 15 , 16 ). The skin of the vast majority of soft robots consists of an unstructured flexible membrane that lacks directional frictional properties. As a result, multiple actuators activated independently are typically required to achieve locomotion ( 16 – 21 ).

Nature offers many examples of slender limbless organisms that take advantage of both the flexibility of their body and the frictional properties of their skin to efficiently move and explore the surrounding space ( 1 – 5 ). For example, snakes rely on the substantial reconfiguration in the shape of their body ( 6 ) and on the frictional anisotropy of their skin ( 7 ) to propel themselves. Not only microscopic features ( 8 , 9 ) but also the macroscale structure and arrangement of their ventral scales contribute to such anisotropic friction ( 5 ), because their preferred orientation makes sliding in the forward direction much easier than in the backward one.

RESULTS

We considered a soft fluidic actuator comprising an elastomeric tube made of silicone rubber (Smooth-On Inc., Ecoflex 00-30; shear modulus μ a ≃ 30 kPa) with a length of 164 mm and a triangular cross section with edges of 25 mm (see Fig. 1, B and C). To maximize its elongation during inflation and constrain any other mode of deformation, we surrounded the tube with stiff Kevlar fibers arranged in a helical pattern with small pitch (so that the fibers were almost aligned with the circumferential direction—see the Supplementary Materials for details). We found that the actuator extended by 25% when inflated with a maximum volume of V max = 24 ml of air. However, because symmetry resulted in equal movements of both actuator ends during inflation and deflation, this system did not move forward when placed on a substrate (see movie S2).

Next, we covered the actuator with kirigami skins (see Fig. 1D and movie S3) and investigated their effect on its ability to move. Our kirigami skins were fabricated by laser cutting 9 by 32 centimeter-scale unit cells arranged on a triangular lattice with spacing of l = 4.5 mm and hinge width of δ = 0.7 mm into polyester plastic sheets (Artus Corporation; Young’s modulus of E = 4.33 GPa, see fig. S2). Inspired by the shapes observed in ventral scales of snakes (22), we considered four different cuts (see Fig. 2A): (i) linear cuts, (ii) triangular cuts, (iii) circular cuts, and (iv) trapezoidal cuts. For all assembled kirigami-skinned crawlers, we first characterized their elongation (ε) and pressure (P) as a function of the supplied volume (V) and then investigated how inflation affected the frictional force when they moved on a substrate. To this end, we pulled (i.e., moved backward) and pushed (i.e., moved forward) the crawlers inflated by different amounts of air against a rough surface (polyurethane foam) while monitoring the resistive force (F fr ). Effective coefficients of friction in backward (μ b ) and forward (μ f ) directions were then extracted from these measurements as (1)where F N ≃ 0.2 N is the crawler’s weight, 〈 ⋅ 〉 denotes the mean value, and and are the local peaks of F fr recorded during pulling and pushing, respectively (see the Supplementary Materials for details).

Although the pattern with linear cuts has been used frequently to design highly stretchable systems (26, 29), we found that the corresponding kirigami skin severely limited the extensibility of the actuator [i.e., ε = (L − L 0 )/L 0 < 0.05, L 0 , and L denoting the undeformed and deformed lengths of the perforated part of the skin (Fig. 2B)] and made it very stiff (see Fig. 2C). This is because the antisymmetric out-of-plane buckling mode typical of this kirigami sheet is characterized by alternating up and down (see fig. S6B) buckled ligaments (26) and therefore is suppressed by the presence of the actuator. Hence, no features pop up upon inflation (see inset in Fig. 2F), the crawler slides smoothly in both directions, and the frictional force recorded during pulling and pushing reaches similar values, which are not affected by the supplied volume V (see red lines in Fig. 2, D and E), yielding μ f (V) ≃ μ b (V) ≃ 0.75 − 1 (see Fig. 2F).

By contrast, we found that the other three skins only moderately limited the extensibility of the soft actuator (i.e., ε ≃ 0.12 ~ 0.18, see Fig. 2B) and resulted in a pressure-elongation curve characterized by an initial linear regime, a pressure plateau, and a final stiffening. While in the initial linear regime, all hinges bent in-plane, and the skins remained flat; the sudden departure from linearity to a plateau stress was caused by the out-of-plane buckling of the hinges, which induced the formation of a 3D pattern similar to that of a snake’s skin with all features homogeneously popping outward (see insets in Fig. 2, G to I, and fig. S8). This buckling-induced pop-up significantly altered the measured frictional force. Before the instability (i.e., for supplied volume ratios V/V max < 0.25), the crawlers slid smoothly in both forward and backward directions, and μ b ≃ μ f ≃ 1 ~ 1.5 for all three systems (the slight increase in μ b and μ f compared to the case of the skin with linear cuts was due to the sharper features of the cuts). However, above the instability threshold (i.e., for supplied volume ratios V/V max > 0.25), the popping out of the features defined by the cuts led to a jerking motion in backward direction, with the crawlers that alternatively stuck to the substrate and slid over it. This stick-slip regime was also apparent from the measured frictional force, which presented a discrete sequence of sharp drops (see Fig. 2E). Moreover, the instability-induced pop-up process resulted in a significant increase of the magnitude of F fr measured during pulling (see Fig. 2E) so that μ b >> μ f for supplied volume ratios V/V max > 0.25. Therefore, our results indicate that buckling can be exploited to transform the frictional properties of a surface from isotropic to highly anisotropic. However, for this transformation to happen, it is necessary that all features pop up in the same direction (i.e., toward the crawlers’ tail). To demonstrate this important point, we considered a kirigami skin with half of the triangular cuts pointing to the head of the crawler and the remaining pointing to its tail (we refer to this pattern as the mirrored triangular pattern). In this case, buckling triggered a pop-up process, and the symmetry of the resulting 3D pattern induced a significant increase of both μ f and μ b and did not introduce any frictional directionality (i.e., μ b ~ μ f , see fig. S6C).

To this end, we monitored the position of the crawlers placed on a rough surface (polyurethane foam) as they were inflated by supplying a volume of air V max = 24 ml and deflated by extracting the same amount of fluid at a rate of 300 ml/min (see movie S4). In Fig. 3A, we overlay initial and final positions of the crawlers after six inflation cycles, whereas in Fig. 3B, we report the evolution of the displacement of their centers of mass (solid lines), tails (dashed lines), and heads (dotted lines). These results indicate that the crawlers with kirigami skins exhibiting directional frictional properties (i.e., those with circular, triangular, and trapezoidal cuts) were capable of propelling themselves much more efficiently than the other ones. Specifically, if we indicated with u cycle , the displacement recorded at the end of each cycle, then we found that u cycle /L 0 = 0, 0.015, 0.068, 0.08, and 0.12 for the kirigami-skinned crawlers with linear, mirrored triangular, triangular, circular, and trapezoidal cuts, respectively. Although the poor performance of the kirigami-skinned crawler with linear cuts can be attributed to its very limited extensibility, the very short distance traveled by the crawler with the mirrored triangular cuts points to the importance of the anisotropic frictional properties introduced by the buckled kirigami skins.

The skin with trapezoidal cuts was more stretchable than those with circular and triangular cuts and, therefore, enabled the crawler to have a longer stride and move further.

To further understand how the frictional properties of our kirigami skins affect locomotion, we focused on the position of the anchor point (x a ) at which the crawlers gripped the substrate (i.e., the instantaneous stagnation point along the crawler body) to pull themselves forward and prevent backward sliding (6). By balancing the frictional forces exerted by the substrate on the skin (while neglecting inertial forces due to the slow nature of the crawling motion), we show that (see the Supplementary Materials for details) (2)which provides explicit relations between the position of the anchor point and the frictional properties of the kirigami skin. Equation 2 indicates that, to maximize the distance traveled by the crawlers, the ratio μ b /μ f should be as large as possible. In this case, x a /L approaches ±0.5, and anchoring occurs at the tail during inflation/elongation and at the head during deflation/shortening, completely preventing backward sliding. Moreover, Eq. 2 also shows that for μ b ~ μ f , the anchor point is located at the center of mass of the crawlers (i.e., x a /L ~ 0). In this case, the head and tail of the crawlers move by the same amount (but in opposite directions) during inflation and deflation, and there is no advancement. In Fig. 3C, we compared the position of the anchor point extracted by our tests with that predicted by Eq. 2 using the experimentally measured friction coefficients reported in Fig. 2 (F to I). We found that the trends observed in our experiments are well captured by our simple model. When the kirigami skin has isotropic frictional properties (as for the patterns with mirrored triangular cuts during the entire inflation/deflation process and with circular, triangular, and trapezoidal cuts before buckling), then x a /L is about 0. By contrast, if μ b >> μ f (as for the skins with triangular, circular, and trapezoidal cuts after buckling), then the anchor point moves toward the tail and the head of the crawler during inflation and deflation, respectively.

The results reported in Fig. 3 (A to C) show that, by taking advantage of the directional frictional properties induced in the kirigami skins by buckling, even a single soft actuator can propel itself. They also indicate that the conditions used in our experiments were not optimal, because even for our best kirigami-skinned crawlers, the anchor points were located near their centers of mass for volume ratios V/V max < 0.25. This limitation can be overcome by not fully deflating the actuators so that they always operate in the region where the skin has anisotropic frictional properties. In Fig. 3E, we report the measured (markers) and predicted (continuous lines) total displacement (u tot ) when a total volume V tot = 120 ml of air was supplied by cyclically inflating and deflating them between the maximum volume V max = 24 ml and the minimum volume V min ∈ [0,V max ] (see movie S5 and the Supplementary Materials for details). We found that there is an optimum value of the minimum volume V min for which the crawlers move more efficiently. Whereas for smaller values of the minimum volume V min, the lack of anisotropic frictional properties resulted in smaller total displacement u tot , when V min was increased above the optimum value, the limited change in length experienced by the crawlers during the cycles became the limiting factor.

To date, we have considered kirigami skins that were initially flat and in which buckling induced the reversible and repeatable formation of a 3D directional texture, but plastic deformation at the ligaments can also be harnessed to generate a permanent 3D morphology (28) and, therefore, to improve the efficiency of the crawlers. To demonstrate this, we considered a kirigami skin with triangular cuts, and before wrapping it around the actuators, we applied a large stretch so that in the post-buckling regime, plastic strains developed in the ligament between the cuts, creating a permanent pop-up pattern (see insets of Fig. 3E). We found that this plastically deformed skin affected the response of the system in two ways. On the one hand, it increased the elongation that the crawler experienced at the beginning of the inflation process (Fig. 3E). On the other hand, its permanent directional texture resulted in highly anisotropic frictional properties through the entire actuation process (Fig. 3F). Hence, the efficiency in locomotion for this crawler was optimal when the supplied volume was cyclically varied between 0 and 12 ml (Fig. 3G), resulting in ~22% improvement in comparison to the best performance of the corresponding crawler with a purely elastic kirigami skin.",NA
64,"The Royal Takin Preserve in Thimpu, Bhutan, is the only facility with animals on exhibit in Bhutan. This 19-acre park houses various antelope and deer species native to the country, especially the national animal: the Bhutan takin.

David Emanuel designed Princess Diana’s wedding dress for her wedding to the Prince of Wales in 1981 and when he was asked he gave his candid opinion of Meghan Markle’s stunning gown. Mr Emanuel said: ""I think Diana would have approved."" Meghan’s royal wedding dress was designed by British designer Clare Waight Keller for French fashion house Givenchy. Ms Keller is the first female artists director of the fashion house.

The gown itself is simple, elegant white, but has an elaborate veil with flowers that from each of the 53 Commonwealth nations at Meghan’s request, according to Kensington Palace. The dress features pure lines and an open bateau neckline framing the shoulders, emphasising Meghan’s slender waist. The train draped in soft folds with a triple silk organza underskirt. Mr Emanuel said the trite was “clever” as she Meghan also requested to have two of her personal favourites added: a California poppy and wintersweet, which grows in the grounds of where her and Prince Harry live at Nottingham Cottage of Kensington Palace.

Silchar: Residents of Rongmei village in Binnakandi Part II fondly remembered Haipou Jadonang, a spiritual leader and political activist, on his death anniversary recently.

He was born on June 10, 1905 at Puiluan village in Tamenglong district in Manipur. He was the activist claiming himself to be Naga Raj against British rule in tribal areas mostly in Manipur, Nagaland and Assam.

He fought against the imposition of taxes and asked his followers to pay taxes to him for the fiscal year 1931-32 and urged them to fight for national prestige and social change. On February 19, 1931, he was arrested by the British political agent J C Higgins in Lakhipur. He was imprisoned in Silchar jail after being arrested while he was returning from Bhuban Cave with Rani Gaidinliu and 600 other followers.

A month later, Jadonang was brought to Imphal jail on March 19. He was declared guilty of the murder at a trail headed by authority of British occupation of India on June 13, 1931. He was hanged to death on August 29, 1931 at 6 am on the banks of Nambul river behind Imphal jail. The meeting was over by Kangbung Rongmei. Among others who spoke at length on the life and times of the great leader included Gopal Rongmei, Kagachung Rongmei, Thomas Rongmei and Purnima Rongmei.

Quotes

The Creator had put us on this land, land that you call Southern Nevada. He taught us to keep the land sacred and to keep it healthy. We were also taught the ways to heal ourselves and others. These teachings are what we practice today; it is our way of life. All lands are sensitive and sacred and should be treated with respect. Some parts of the land give us food while other places give us medicine. If these lands are destroyed or contaminated they will not provide for us the things that we need. Some health problems cannot be healed by your western medicine, yet this land provides us the medicine to heal those health problems. This land is sacred and also provides ways for us to travel in safety. I’ve seen instances where the land had provided my family with a safe journey. I have used medicine from this land and seen how much this medicine works. We are not the only creatures that this land provides for. The creatures that live in this area, not only on the ground but in the sky and in the water, the land provides for. The plants are also residents of this land. All of these things are alive also the land is alive and it breathes just the same as you and me. Without these creatures and the plants we would be without food, medicine, and shelter. We would not be provided with even the clothes that we had worn, in the past.

– Calvin Meyers, Moapa Southern Paiute , cited in Little Springs Lava Flow Ethnographic Investigation

Northern Paiute:

Deeply grounded in their environment, the Northern Paiutes believe that power (pooha) resides in natural objects such as animals, plants and geographical features. This strong connection to the environment is evident in the names of different bands. For example, Pyramid Lake Paiutes are called Kuyuidokado (Cui-ui eaters), after the Cui-ui fish, found nowhere else in the world.

The Northern Paiute live in areas including Lovelock, McDermitt, Mason Valley, Smith Valley, Pyramid Lake, Reno-Sparks, Stillwater, Fallon, Summit Lake and Walker River. Unlike many Native Americans throughout the country, the Pyramid Lake Paiute and the Walker River Paiute never faced complete relocation. Their ancestors have lived there for millennia. The Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation is home to the only Scenic Byway in the country completely within a tribal reservation.

The Northern Paiute all share the desire to make the present and the future better than their challenging past while teaching younger generations appreciation of their cultural and linguistic heritage.

Signature Events

Pine Nut Festival

Every third weekend of September, several hundred American Indians and visitors gather at the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation in Schurz to participate in a spiritual ceremony that celebrates life and the harvest. The festival’s many events include an Indian rodeo, powwow dance, stick games and pine nut dance. During the pine nut dance, dancers move on sacred ground in a circle around a staff with eagle feathers and tobacco offerings for what is called the pine nut blessing. The spiritual ceremony dates back more than one hundred years to a time when the pine nut was winter subsistence for Great Basin Indians. Today, the dance is a way to honor the tribe’s ancestors, preserve native traditions and revive spiritual practices.

Places of special interest

Scenic Byway Visitors Cultural Center

The Pyramid Lake Scenic Byway Visitors Cultural Center is located on the south side of Pyramid Lake, in the town of Nixon. The Cultural Center offers a great display of local American Indian artifacts that show the history of the Kooyooe Tukaddu people. The center is open Monday through Friday during the winter and Monday through Saturday in the summer.

http://www.nevadaindianterritory.com/nevada-tribes/northern-paiute/

The Southern Paiute:

Since at least 1100 A.D., the Southern Paiute lived in 15 bands across southeastern Nevada and neighboring states. To survive the desert environment, they drank from springs, hunted wild game and harvested plants.

Two groups of federally recognized Southern Paiute bands live in Nevada: The Moapa Band and The Las Vegas Paiute Band. The Pahrump Band of Paiute also lives in the area. The native languages of the Southern Paiutes and Northern Paiutes are different but related.

The Southern Paiutes operate the Las Vegas Paiute Golf Resort with three 18-hole courses—each rated 4 ½ stars by Golf Digest—and a restaurant with views of the Sheep Mountains. In addition, the Moapa Paiute Travel Plaza with its 2,500-square-foot casino and fireworks store greets visitors on their way to Valley of Fire State Park. The Moapa Paiutes also are developing the first large-scale solar project on tribal land, which will provide tribal revenue and jobs.

Signature Events

Snow Mountain Powwow

The Las Vegas Paiute Tribe celebrates American Indian culture with its Annual Snow Mountain Powwow. Dancers in colorful traditional dress, artisans and singers from across the United States and Canada gather at this three-day event. The powwow offers a unique shopping experience with jewelry, pottery, flutes, traditional Indian music and baskets available for purchase. Food items include fry bread served with honey and Indian tacos. Some of the best dancers in Indian Territory perform at this event.

‘City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes’ Airing on Clark County Television

In recognition of Native American Heritage Month, Clark County Television (CCTV) is playing “City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes,” a chronicle of the Southern Nevada Paiutes, the indigenous people of the Las Vegas Valley and American Southwest.

These hardy people survived thousands of years of harsh conditions in their native desert until the rapid acceleration of westward expansion, powered by the railroads, brought an end to their traditional lifestyles. In the 20th century, after years of federal back-and-forth policies toward Native Americans, the Paiutes eventually regained some of their traditional lands and a colony in the heart of downtown Las Vegas – hence, the name of this documentary, “A City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes.”

Director Stan Armstrong and Screenwriter Terrence Williams saw in this project an opportunity to connect not only with their own distant native ancestry, but with that of our entire nation — to understand our nation not as a collection of cultures arbitrarily separated by ethnicity, language or culture, but as one people, with many tribes, through the exploration of the beautiful, moving world of the Southern Nevada Paiutes and the Circle Dance which unites us all, they said.

As the documentary demonstrates, the Paiute people, their Ute cousins and all the other tribes throughout Nevada and across the nation, face severe, sometimes systemic social, economic and political problems that have been present since the first contact between Native Americans and European settlers.

“This19th-century holocaust against the indigenous peoples of America is a shameful stain, along with slavery, on our noble experiment in liberty,” Armstrong said. “It is only by confronting that history, by preserving these experiences, and now treasuring the contributions of living Native American culture that we can begin to ‘do right always,’ as our state’s Native Prophet once said.”

“All is not tragedy,” Armstrong said. “The Paiutes are not museum relics. They are a vibrant people with a proud history and a long-term, singular role in the development of Native American spirituality. The aim of ‘A City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes’ is to let them tell their story to all of the peoples of America, to carry the lessons from their culture and soul into the 21st century, when perhaps our nation tribe needs them most.”

Quotes

The Creator had put us on this land, land that you call Southern Nevada. He taught us to keep the land sacred and to keep it healthy. We were also taught the ways to heal ourselves and others. These teachings are what we practice today; it is our way of life. All lands are sensitive and sacred and should be treated with respect. Some parts of the land give us food while other places give us medicine. If these lands are destroyed or contaminated they will not provide for us the things that we need. Some health problems cannot be healed by your western medicine, yet this land provides us the medicine to heal those health problems. This land is sacred and also provides ways for us to travel in safety. I’ve seen instances where the land had provided my family with a safe journey. I have used medicine from this land and seen how much this medicine works. We are not the only creatures that this land provides for. The creatures that live in this area, not only on the ground but in the sky and in the water, the land provides for. The plants are also residents of this land. All of these things are alive also the land is alive and it breathes just the same as you and me. Without these creatures and the plants we would be without food, medicine, and shelter. We would not be provided with even the clothes that we had worn, in the past.

– Calvin Meyers, Moapa Southern Paiute , cited in Little Springs Lava Flow Ethnographic Investigation

Northern Paiute:

Deeply grounded in their environment, the Northern Paiutes believe that power (pooha) resides in natural objects such as animals, plants and geographical features. This strong connection to the environment is evident in the names of different bands. For example, Pyramid Lake Paiutes are called Kuyuidokado (Cui-ui eaters), after the Cui-ui fish, found nowhere else in the world.

The Northern Paiute live in areas including Lovelock, McDermitt, Mason Valley, Smith Valley, Pyramid Lake, Reno-Sparks, Stillwater, Fallon, Summit Lake and Walker River. Unlike many Native Americans throughout the country, the Pyramid Lake Paiute and the Walker River Paiute never faced complete relocation. Their ancestors have lived there for millennia. The Pyramid Lake Indian Reservation is home to the only Scenic Byway in the country completely within a tribal reservation.

The Northern Paiute all share the desire to make the present and the future better than their challenging past while teaching younger generations appreciation of their cultural and linguistic heritage.

Signature Events

Pine Nut Festival

Every third weekend of September, several hundred American Indians and visitors gather at the Walker River Paiute Tribe reservation in Schurz to participate in a spiritual ceremony that celebrates life and the harvest. The festival’s many events include an Indian rodeo, powwow dance, stick games and pine nut dance. During the pine nut dance, dancers move on sacred ground in a circle around a staff with eagle feathers and tobacco offerings for what is called the pine nut blessing. The spiritual ceremony dates back more than one hundred years to a time when the pine nut was winter subsistence for Great Basin Indians. Today, the dance is a way to honor the tribe’s ancestors, preserve native traditions and revive spiritual practices.

Places of special interest

Scenic Byway Visitors Cultural Center

The Pyramid Lake Scenic Byway Visitors Cultural Center is located on the south side of Pyramid Lake, in the town of Nixon. The Cultural Center offers a great display of local American Indian artifacts that show the history of the Kooyooe Tukaddu people. The center is open Monday through Friday during the winter and Monday through Saturday in the summer.

The Southern Paiute:

Since at least 1100 A.D., the Southern Paiute lived in 15 bands across southeastern Nevada and neighboring states. To survive the desert environment, they drank from springs, hunted wild game and harvested plants.

Two groups of federally recognized Southern Paiute bands live in Nevada: The Moapa Band and The Las Vegas Paiute Band. The Pahrump Band of Paiute also lives in the area. The native languages of the Southern Paiutes and Northern Paiutes are different but related.

The Southern Paiutes operate the Las Vegas Paiute Golf Resort with three 18-hole courses—each rated 4 ½ stars by Golf Digest—and a restaurant with views of the Sheep Mountains. In addition, the Moapa Paiute Travel Plaza with its 2,500-square-foot casino and fireworks store greets visitors on their way to Valley of Fire State Park. The Moapa Paiutes also are developing the first large-scale solar project on tribal land, which will provide tribal revenue and jobs.

Signature Events

Snow Mountain Powwow

The Las Vegas Paiute Tribe celebrates American Indian culture with its Annual Snow Mountain Powwow. Dancers in colorful traditional dress, artisans and singers from across the United States and Canada gather at this three-day event. The powwow offers a unique shopping experience with jewelry, pottery, flutes, traditional Indian music and baskets available for purchase. Food items include fry bread served with honey and Indian tacos. Some of the best dancers in Indian Territory perform at this event.

‘City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes’ Airing on Clark County Television

In recognition of Native American Heritage Month, Clark County Television (CCTV) is playing “City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes,” a chronicle of the Southern Nevada Paiutes, the indigenous people of the Las Vegas Valley and American Southwest.

These hardy people survived thousands of years of harsh conditions in their native desert until the rapid acceleration of westward expansion, powered by the railroads, brought an end to their traditional lifestyles. In the 20th century, after years of federal back-and-forth policies toward Native Americans, the Paiutes eventually regained some of their traditional lands and a colony in the heart of downtown Las Vegas – hence, the name of this documentary, “A City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes.”

Director Stan Armstrong and Screenwriter Terrence Williams saw in this project an opportunity to connect not only with their own distant native ancestry, but with that of our entire nation — to understand our nation not as a collection of cultures arbitrarily separated by ethnicity, language or culture, but as one people, with many tribes, through the exploration of the beautiful, moving world of the Southern Nevada Paiutes and the Circle Dance which unites us all, they said.

As the documentary demonstrates, the Paiute people, their Ute cousins and all the other tribes throughout Nevada and across the nation, face severe, sometimes systemic social, economic and political problems that have been present since the first contact between Native Americans and European settlers.

“This19th-century holocaust against the indigenous peoples of America is a shameful stain, along with slavery, on our noble experiment in liberty,” Armstrong said. “It is only by confronting that history, by preserving these experiences, and now treasuring the contributions of living Native American culture that we can begin to ‘do right always,’ as our state’s Native Prophet once said.”

“All is not tragedy,” Armstrong said. “The Paiutes are not museum relics. They are a vibrant people with a proud history and a long-term, singular role in the development of Native American spirituality. The aim of ‘A City Within a City: The History of the Las Vegas Paiutes’ is to let them tell their story to all of the peoples of America, to carry the lessons from their culture and soul into the 21st century, when perhaps our nation tribe needs them most.”

70,"This huge yet little-known South American wilderness is under threat. But plans to turn it into a sustainable tourism hub will help protect its people and wildlife

In the far north of Argentina lies a vast and extremely hot lowland known as the Gran Chaco. Were you to find yourself in it, as I did, you might kayak across a lily-filled lagoon and stumble into a solitary mansion peeking out above an endless sea of green.

It was here, at Estancia La Fidelidad, that eccentric rancher Manuel Roseo lived until 2011, when he was brutally murdered by criminals hoping to take his large (and little-touched) property. Thanks to the quick actions of Argentinian conservationists, provincial officials and the federal government, that tragedy had a silver lining with the birth of a new national park that could just shine a light on a forgotten South American wilderness.

El Impenetrable national park opened to the public in August 2017, following a telenovela’s worth of drama that included not only Roseo’s murder but the hunt for his missing heirs and a long legal battle to expropriate his land. At 128,000 hectares, it’s now the largest national park in northern Argentina and a beacon of hope for the entire Gran Chaco, which fans out into Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil (where it is connected to the Pantanal region) and is South America’s second-largest forest ecosystem after the Amazon.

While the Amazon has become a rallying cry for environmentalists, the bulbous silk floss trees, towering cacti and bushy bramble of the Chaco are disappearing in relative silence. Never as well-known – or as protected – as the Amazon, the Chaco is fast becoming the domain of cattle ranches and soya farms.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The park is a wet oasis in an otherwise semi-arid area

When my plane landed in the regional capital Resistencia (via Buenos Aires) I had expected a dusty frontier town. Instead, I found a surprisingly lush city that fashions itself as an open-air art museum.

Resistencia’s neat and orderly streets are home to some 630 public sculptures, thanks to the Unesco-supported Bienal Internacional de Esculturas (sculpture biennial), and its residents frequent places like the eclectic El Fogón de los Arrieros, a cultural centre-meets-cabinet of curiosities with walls lined with outsider art that puts on evenings filled with tango, jazz and opera.

I hadn’t come all this way to tarry in Resistencia, but found it hard to leave. I knew that the transition from this arty enclave into the wilds of greater Chaco province would be stark and startling, and that my ultimate destination, 250 miles away, would be far removed from the comforts of modern civilisation.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Salmon-coloured roseate spoonbills

I spent one evening in town before hopping in a 4x4 (arranged by Daniel Gaona, of Vagabundos Viajes), the following morning. The landscape outside my window on the road out of Resistencia was pancake-flat and swampy green. Salmon-coloured roseate spoonbills waded in muddy puddles, while howler monkeys paraded through riverside trees. Then, rather jarringly, large cattle ranches and soya farms interrupted the pristine surroundings.

The World Land Trust claims that one hectare of Gran Chaco forest is lost every minute to these twin causes, yet there remain large tracts of land where South America’s big five – jaguars, pumas, tapirs, giant anteaters and giant armadillos – still roam free. To get there, I had to bump down the dirt roads that penetrate the untamed bush of this “impenetrable” forest, trading the thick, sticky air of the Chaco’s eastern half for the skin-sizzling heat of its arid core.

I chose to follow La Ruta de la Cultura Qom, a heritage route launched in 2013 to drive tourism to little-visited communities of the Qom, an indigenous group native to these forests. In the village of Fortín Lavalle, I met Juan Honorio Arguelles of Fundación Gran Chaco, an NGO working with local indigenous communities on reforestation and sustainable development projects.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Indigenous Qom people weave baskets with palm leaves

Arguelles introduced me to three local weavers the foundation sponsors and we joined them on a walk through prickly forests to gather the palm fronds they use to weave their baskets. As we strolled through the densely textured vegetation, the women pointed out medicinal plants they use: the shiny leaves of the cocu help with gallbladder problems, a tea made from molle leaves soothes bronchitis and the wispy “old man’s beard” is a moss that tackles everyday foot odours.

“The forest has always provided the essentials for the indigenous communities of the Chaco,” Arguelles explained. “Our goal is to give them the tools they need to organise themselves, share their culture and have a sustainable existence right here, because the future lies in the forest.”

I travelled west that afternoon from tiny Fortin Lavalle to the agricultural city of Juan José Castelli, the gateway to El Impenetrable. I spent the night at its only lodge, the modern Hotel Portal Del Impenetrable, before departing, at long last, for the park.

El Impenetrable is a thick expanse of semi-arid and riparian forests with an herbaceous aroma and the kind of plants and trees that stick up for themselves, with spiky trunks and thorny branches. The Bermejo and Bermejito rivers border the park, making it a wet oasis in the otherwise dry region.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fortín Lavalle

Birding is a top draw (there are roughly 350 species here), and to spot some I decided to camp under the shade of gnarled, 300-year-old algarrobo trees at Campamento Los Algarrobos, a riverside campground near the village of Nueva Población, on the park’s south-west edge.

Paddling down the murky green Bermejito that afternoon in one of the camp’s kayaks, I spotted great black hawks, little yellow cattle tyrants, slender anhingas (snakebirds) and prehistoric-looking southern screamers.

Back on the coral-coloured land the following morning, I ran across white-lipped peccaries (a hog-like animal), a sunbathing yacare caiman, a fast-moving geoffroy’s cat and a massive hole dug by a giant armadillo – though it, like most of the park’s big game, proved elusive.

Leonardo Juber, El Impenetrable’s 36-year-old superintendent, told me that many of the animals here are so used to being hunted that they’re not yet habituated to harmless wildlife-watchers. He plans to open a series of three-sided animal hides with attached campsites along at least two of the park’s lagoons to make wildlife viewing more viable.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Leonardo Juber, El Impenetrable’s superintendent

“The Chaco is one of the regions with the most biodiversity not only in Argentina, but in all of South America,” he said as we hiked the short Sendero Conejo de los Palos, one of the park’s first trails. It traverses a plain of large, columnar cardón cacti, and is a popular area for Chacoan mara (a rabbit-like rodent).

Back in Juan José Castelli the next evening, I made a beeline for Finca Don Miguel. This new farm-to-table restaurant is emblematic of the region’s tourism hopes. It lies on the family farm of rising chef Alina Ruiz and specialises in regional cuisine, including roast squash, jerky stew and fantastic alfajor cookies made from the seeds of algarrobo trees.

The gregarious Adrián Contreras joined me for dinner. A fast-talking transplant from Buenos Aires, he’s in charge of Master Plan El Impenetrable, a project to turn this undeveloped region into a hub of sustainable tourism. He told me that step one (due for completion in the first half of 2019) is to build an interactive interpretation centre in Miraflores, a village near the park entrance, and to make the local Qom and Wichí communities caretakers of four new eco-lodges on the park’s edge. The communities will receive appropriate training, equipment (like kayaks and stoves) and spaces to sell their crafts.

Contreras admits that there is still much work ahead to arm El Impenetrable with the infrastructure it needs (and deserves) to lure the less intrepid. But it’s an ambitious plan, and it may be exactly what the Gran Chaco has been waiting for: a new economic driver that sees the forest as an asset worth keeping.

Stratus Rooftop Lounge and Red Owl Tavern are both located inside the Hotel and both of these establishments are setting the bar very high for other eateries in the city.

Red Owl Tavern and Stratus Rooftop Lounge deliciously mix the past with the present

Being at the epicenter of historic Philadelphia, Red Owl Tavern aims to revive that classic tavern experience that was around during the birth of our Nation with an upscale modern touch. The combination of Executive Chef Robert Surdam’s enticing and savory dishes with Lead Bartender Kyle Darrow’s innovative and refreshing cocktails make Red Owl Tavern a one-of-a-kind experience.

At ROT details are important, down to the last sip of a Peach Tree cocktail. Each meal and drink has been crafted to look just as good as it tastes. It’s comfort food from Philly made with an international twist, and cocktails made with fresh ingredients and bold flavors. ROT is open for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. Check out the menu at redowltavern.com

On top of the hotel is another gem; Stratus Rooftop Lounge takes your experience to an all new height, literally. Being a historic building the rooftop is massive and the atmosphere is unlike anywhere else. The location gives a sense of exclusivity; famed Los Angeles designer Gulla Jonsdottir designed Stratus to feel inspiring yet comfortable, with lush textures, swaying greenery, and moveable walls for year-round indulging.

The cocktails are out of this world. The new menu captures all the flavors and essences of fall including their No S’more Parties in LA (Graham infused Basil Hayden’s Bourbon, toasted marshmallow syrup and chocolate bitters) and their Baked Bellini (Ketel One vodka, roasted sweet potato cordial, prosseco and cinnamon sugar). Their food pairs perfectly as well ranging from savory small plates to flatbreads. Check out the menu at stratuslounge.com.

‘A big hairy thing with too many legs’ is what a beast supposedly is, according to Ron Weasley, who had taken the trouble of writing down his opinions all over Harry Potter’s copy of ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,’ before understanding that there are more aspects to beasts than he realizes. Although not as mysterious as the beasts from the wizarding world, the beasts of Bengal arealmost as difficult to discover.

Being home to roughly 712 species of amphibians, reptiles, mammals and marine mammals, Bangladesh is a must-visit destination for all the wildlife photographers out there. Starting from the Bengal tiger to the lesser known Bengal fox, the beasts of Bengal are characterized by far more than just what Weasley had initially thought.

The Royal Bengal Tiger

Found in the Sundarbans, lives to be the national animal of Bangladesh, however it only numbers up to 440 in Bangladesh with a decreasing trend in population.

The Sun Bear

This one is a bear found in tropical forest habitats and has been recently sighted in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.

The team that captured its photos also managed to capture in frames the Himalayan Serow, Asian Golden Cat, Sambar Deer, Leopard Cat and Dhole, of which the Dhole is the most endangered Asiatic top predator as of 2010.

Arakan Forest Turtle

Locals in the Chittagaong Hill Tracts led conservationists to a new population of Arakan Forest Turtle. Once thought extinct, the critically endangered species was assumed only to survive in neighbouring Myanmar.

The Cheetal Deer

Probably the most widely known deer in Bangladesh, the cheetal deer

found in the Sundarbans. This is the kind of deer we see in a sort of golden-ish hue, complete with white spots and antlers.

The Bengal Fox

A relatively small fox with elongated muzzle, found in the southeast of Bangladesh. Although not endangered, the lack of proper habitat acts as a major threat to this species.

The Capped Langur

Widely found in Lawachara National Park,The Capped Languris another species threatened by habitat loss. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests, and can be sighted in parts of Sylhet.

Having described all the fantastic beasts of Bengal, one should add that most of them are inclined towards being adorable rather than beastly, and thus should be protected so as not to become endangered.

76,"Figure 1. Location of Wonegizi, North-eastern Lofa County, Liberia

The Potentials of Wonegizi as a Protected Area (PA) in the development of the communities, districts and Lofa County is in the process of gazettement. This is the process when all stakeholders cooperate and make joyous efforts to make the Protected Area in Law. As a citizen of Lofa and two times Managing Director of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) in two difference administration, it is a very good news for me and welcoming news for communities of Wonegizi. It will be a remised if I do not tell the story as it is.

Wonegizi Protected Area to be known as the Wonegizi Multi-Use Reserve (MUR) is located in western Liberia adjacent to the Ziama Biosphere Reserve classified as the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve. The proposed protected Wonegizi has been designated as Multiple Use Nature Reserve next to proposed protected area of Wologizi as a strict nature reserve, which has the potential of becoming a transboundary area which could provide tremendous benefits as a ""Peace Park."" Peace Parks are land spaces between the borders of two countries where citizens interact peacefully and avoid violence and any acts of aggression.

The Wonegizi proposed protected area (Figure 1) is a part of the tropical forest in the Upper Guinea region lying from Guinea to Togo. In this region Liberia shares the highest portion, about 43%, of the tropical forest cover, while Ivory Coast shares the next, 16%. According to the findings of scientists meeting in Cape Coast, Ghana in 1999, the Liberian portion of this Upper Guinea Forest is very rich in biodiversity. This simply means that there are abundant and various species of plants (flora) and animals (fauna). These scientists also agreed that the biodiversity of the region is also globally significant, meaning that whatever affects it may have implications for the rest of the world. The point to recognize is that Wonegizi landscape is in a country with rich and globally significant biodiversity. Wonegizi has very high relevant potentials in biodiversity.

There remains two significant forest blocks that determine the significance of the biodiversity content of the 43% of Liberia's share in the Upper Guinea Forest: The Southeastern Block and The Northwest ern Block. The Government of Liberia and partners have already recognized the importance and potentials of the Southeastern Block by establishing and managing several protected areas including the Sapo National Park and the Grebo-Krahn Forest National Park. Meanwhile, the East Nimba Nature Reserve, The Lake Piso Multi-purpose Reserve have been established. In order to tap the potentials of the Western block, the Gola Forest National Park was established in 2015, thus bringing into existence five of the seven protected areas (Figure 2) envisaged by GOL to accomplish the conservation objective under the 3 C sustainable forest management policy.

Figure 2. Proposed protected areas of Liberia

To achieve the objective of the conservation policy, a network of protected areas is to be established under the protected area network law of 2003. All protected areas established under this Law before the policy reform law of 2006 have been classified as a network of protected areas, while those protected areas established after policy reform law are referred to the Expanded protected areas network (EXPAN), and these include: Lake Piso Multi-Purpose Reserve, Gola National Park, and Grebo-Krahn Forest National Park. The establishment of Wonegizi Mult-purpose Use Reserve and Wologizi Strict Nature Reserve will bring the number of protected areas to seven proposed by the GOL.

To be become a protected area for multiple uses, the FDA and development partners have been conducting studies to justify why Wonegizi should become a protected area. Findings from these studies indicate that tremendous potentials of Wonegizi as a protected area for the development of Lofa County. The Wonegizi Protected Area has 13 communities that will be directed impacted by the establishment of the Wonegizi Multiplue Use Reserve. Nine of the 13 communities are located in Zorzor District, 2 in Voinjama District and 2 in Quardu-Gboni District. These communities will benefit from activities in core zones such as carbon credits, hunting, farming and production of timber products.

Western Chimpanzee

The WMUR contains 5 key species which are under threat. They include: Jentink's duiker, Diana monkey, West African red colobus, green-tailed bristlebill and yellow-bearded greenbul. Also, it contains 2 vulnerable bird species: Nimba flycatcher and the white-necked rockfowl or picathartes. Additionally, corridors and buffer zones will be provided for large mammals such as western chimpanzees, forest elephants, pygmy hippo, sooty mangabey, etc. to facilitate their mobility.

Picarthartes

In 2013 survey, 374 plant species were identified, of which 66 (18%) are Upper Guinea endemics. In national comparison, about 2.3% of total flowering or vascular plants (2900) in Liberia. Examples of the species are: Anubias gracilis, Dicranolepis laciniata, Diospyros heudelotii, Millettia warneckei, Paramacrolobium coeruleum, Pseudoprosopis sericea and Samanea dinklagei. Allanblackia parviflora. According to James T. Kpadeyea, a botanist from the Wonegizi area, some of the plants have medicinal values.

Potentials and intended benefits of WMUR should be highlighted:

WMUR is intended to be multiple use reserve meaning all the beneficiary communities will be allowed to use the landscape for livelihood enhancement in normal circumstances;

The landscape will be divided into economic zones which will allow beneficiaries to derive benefits the zones under supervised procedures for hunting, farming, harvest of nontimber forest products; and*-

in the case of REDD+ project zone, carbon benefits will be derived by communities which will reduce emission and increase carbon sink.

In the are of tourism, many tourist assets will be created and tourist guards trained to engage in the management of tourism in the landscape.

Wonegizi Protected Area to be known as the Wonegizi Multi-Use Reserve (MUR) is located in western Liberia adjacent to the Ziama Biosphere Reserve classified as the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Reserve. The proposed protected Wonegizi has been designated as Multiple Use Nature Reserve next to proposed protected area of Wologizi as a strict nature reserve, which has the potential of becoming a transboundary area which could provide tremendous benefits as a ""Peace Park."" Peace Parks are land spaces between the borders of two countries where citizens interact peacefully and avoid violence and any acts of aggression.

The Wonegizi proposed protected area (Figure 1) is a part of the tropical forest in the Upper Guinea region lying from Guinea to Togo. In this region Liberia shares the highest portion, about 43%, of the tropical forest cover, while Ivory Coast shares the next, 16%. According to the findings of scientists meeting in Cape Coast, Ghana in 1999, the Liberian portion of this Upper Guinea Forest is very rich in biodiversity. This simply means that there are abundant and various species of plants (flora) and animals (fauna). These scientists also agreed that the biodiversity of the region is also globally significant, meaning that whatever affects it may have implications for the rest of the world. The point to recognize is that Wonegizi landscape is in a country with rich and globally significant biodiversity. Wonegizi has very high relevant potentials in biodiversity.

There remains two significant forest blocks that determine the significance of the biodiversity content of the 43% of Liberia's share in the Upper Guinea Forest: The Southeastern Block and The Northwest ern Block. The Government of Liberia and partners have already recognized the importance and potentials of the Southeastern Block by establishing and managing several protected areas including the Sapo National Park and the Grebo-Krahn Forest National Park. Meanwhile, the East Nimba Nature Reserve, The Lake Piso Multi-purpose Reserve have been established. In order to tap the potentials of the Western block, the Gola Forest National Park was established in 2015, thus bringing into existence five of the seven protected areas (Figure 2) envisaged by GOL to accomplish the conservation objective under the 3 C sustainable forest management policy.

Figure 2. Proposed protected areas of Liberia

To achieve the objective of the conservation policy, a network of protected areas is to be established under the protected area network law of 2003. All protected areas established under this Law before the policy reform law of 2006 have been classified as a network of protected areas, while those protected areas established after policy reform law are referred to the Expanded protected areas network (EXPAN), and these include: Lake Piso Multi-Purpose Reserve, Gola National Park, and Grebo-Krahn Forest National Park. The establishment of Wonegizi Mult-purpose Use Reserve and Wologizi Strict Nature Reserve will bring the number of protected areas to seven proposed by the GOL.

To be become a protected area for multiple uses, the FDA and development partners have been conducting studies to justify why Wonegizi should become a protected area. Findings from these studies indicate that tremendous potentials of Wonegizi as a protected area for the development of Lofa County. The Wonegizi Protected Area has 13 communities that will be directed impacted by the establishment of the Wonegizi Multiplue Use Reserve. Nine of the 13 communities are located in Zorzor District, 2 in Voinjama District and 2 in Quardu-Gboni District. These communities will benefit from activities in core zones such as carbon credits, hunting, farming and production of timber products.

Western Chimpanzee

The WMUR contains 5 key species which are under threat. They include: Jentink's duiker, Diana monkey, West African red colobus, green-tailed bristlebill and yellow-bearded greenbul. Also, it contains 2 vulnerable bird species: Nimba flycatcher and the white-necked rockfowl or picathartes. Additionally, corridors and buffer zones will be provided for large mammals such as western chimpanzees, forest elephants, pygmy hippo, sooty mangabey, etc. to facilitate their mobility.

Picarthartes

In 2013 survey, 374 plant species were identified, of which 66 (18%) are Upper Guinea endemics. In national comparison, about 2.3% of total flowering or vascular plants (2900) in Liberia. Examples of the species are: Anubias gracilis, Dicranolepis laciniata, Diospyros heudelotii, Millettia warneckei, Paramacrolobium coeruleum, Pseudoprosopis sericea and Samanea dinklagei. Allanblackia parviflora. According to James T. Kpadeyea, a botanist from the Wonegizi area, some of the plants have medicinal values.

Potentials and intended benefits of WMUR should be highlighted:

WMUR is intended to be multiple use reserve meaning all the beneficiary communities will be allowed to use the landscape for livelihood enhancement in normal circumstances;

The landscape will be divided into economic zones which will allow beneficiaries to derive benefits the zones under supervised procedures for hunting, farming, harvest of nontimber forest products; and*-

in the case of REDD+ project zone, carbon benefits will be derived by communities which will reduce emission and increase carbon sink.

In the are of tourism, many tourist assets will be created and tourist guards trained to engage in the management of tourism in the landscape.

78,"Some plants can no longer survive in the wild, but hand-pollinated seeds allow them to live on in your home patch

There is something fascinatingly weird about us gardeners. For as much as horticulture is all about the therapeutic art of nurturing and caring for plants, it is also often just as much about the feverish need to amass collections of them.

From the 19th-century oligarchs who would send teams of plant hunters to scour the earth for the undiscovered to 21st-century urban flat dwellers like me who will spend hours (and far too much money) on internet auction sites and rare plant markets to track down elusive varieties, this pursuit of rarity seems for many an intrinsic part of what it is to be a gardener. All too often, however, this desire can put pressure on wild populations, as plants are over-collected to fuel this insatiable demand.

There is a solution. If you have this hunger for growing the weird and wonderful, look to plants that are so rare they are actually extinct in the wild.

For those with only a windowsill, things don’t get much better than the Hawaiian palm Brighamia insignis. Its stout, fleshy, silvery sheened trunk is topped with a lush crown of lobed, apple-green leaves, making it look like something out of a sci-fi film. In early summer, mature plants throw out a spray of elegant white, star-shaped flowers with funnel-like throats. Sadly it is this elegance that was part of their undoing. With such long throats to their flowers, they could only be pollinated by a moth that evolved alongside them. When that became extinct, it doomed the plants to relying on humans to propagate them. Fortunately hand-pollinated plants are now sold widely in the houseplant trade, with a percentage of funds going to conserve its native habitat.

For those with a sunny conservatory, angel’s trumpet, or brugmansia, is a dramatic shrub from the high Andes, sending out dozens of sweetly scented hanging trumpets in a range of pastels. All seven species in this genus are thought to be functionally extinct in the wild, as although they are capable of setting viable fruit, the seeds within remain trapped inside a tough husk and undispersed. It is thought this vital ecological service was once carried out by giant sloths, hunted to extinction millennia ago. Fortunately, indigenous people prize these species for religious and ritual use, which has helped keep them going.

Finally, for those with garden space, my pick is a ginkgo. Despite being one of the world’s most ancient plants, predating dinosaurs, they are believed to be totally extinct in the wild. The last remaining forest stand of them in their native east Asia, was recently found to not be wild at all, but an ancient plantation tended to by monks. With beautiful fish-tail leaves that turn butter yellow in the autumn, wonderful architectural structure and potential medicinal value (the leaves are used to make a tea believed to enhance memory), you can’t ask for much more. If you don’t have much space, ginkgos make good candidates for pots, which dramatically restrict their growth rate.

Horticulture is the only thing keeping many of these species alive, so by choosing to grow these plants you are playing a direct part in their conservation. It is how to get some of the rarest plants on earth in your collection, in a sustainable way.

79,"No one is certain we’ll actually make it to see Monty, a 900-year-old Montezuma bald cypress tree that’s been rooted in the Rio Grande basin since before the Aztecs rose to power, or what will happen once we get there.

Ernest Herrera, a wildlife biologist in south Texas, is one of two scientists taking me to see the tree. University of Texas biology researcher Flor Martinez and Jackie Treviño, Herrera’s former supervisor and an environmental organizer, are with us, too. All three of them were born and raised along the U.S.-Mexico border, in the Rio Grande Valley.

While we were sitting at the gas station that morning, they joked that it was good they had me, “a white girl,” with them this time. They’d all been told, via friends and the valley’s environmentalist network, that people had been recently detained by Border Patrol for visiting Monty. They’d been told not to return.

“Even folks from the region who are documented are approached, questioned, and even detained,” Treviño says. “Without question, if you go to some of these wild spaces, you are surveilled and viewed as suspect simply for being there.”

Monty stands a few miles east of McAllen, Texas, and a few miles north of Reynosa, Mexico, the border’s busiest sector. The tree is just 200 yards south of the earthen levee that runs parallel to the Rio Grande, about a mile from its bank on the edge of the river’s floodplain.

Montezuma bald cypresses require a lot of water, so much so that the Aztecs named the species ahuehue, “old man on the water”; its seeds will only germinate in water or wet soil. As time and human intervention have moved the river’s flow about a mile away, it’s near impossible to get the tree enough nutrients.

With the wall, the federal government is taking control of the Rio Grande Valley’s final surviving tracts of native ground and turning it into a no-man’s-land. For the people who call this place home, Monty, the abuelo of the Rio Grande, represents what’s at stake in the fight over the president’s “big, beautiful” barrier.

The Department of Homeland Security is building the wall on the levee in accordance with the 1970 U.S.-Mexico treaty, which prohibits physical barriers within the floodplain. The existing segments, authorized by the 2006 Secure Fence Act, provide a good example of what is to come—in March 2018, Congress approved $600 million for 33 more miles of border wall here.

The slope on the southern side of the levee has been shaved down to make a dead-vertical rise as tall as a single-story house and plastered with cement. Eighteen-foot rust-colored metal slats stand on top, framing the road that runs up and over the levee.

Less than 5 percent of the Rio Grande Valley’s native ecosystem remains unchanged or undeveloped since the 1500s.

In addition to providing habitat for the endangered ocelot, a wild cat native to the area, and the star cactus, more than 500 different bird species can be found here. It’s the confluence of two migratory paths that extend north toward Canada and south toward Mexico. The World Birding Center’s headquarters are located in the valley, in Bentsen-Rio Grande State Park, and thousands of people flock here each year to see red-crowned parrots, highlighter orange Altamira orioles, silky green jays, white-tipped doves, and more.

The Rio Grande Valley also supports one of the highest concentrations of butterflies in the country and is home to the National Butterfly Center. Nearly 150 U.S. butterfly species have no habitat left other than what’s here. According to the center, many won’t fly over a wall. Unfortunately, for both the wildlife and the people dependent on the millions of ecotourism dollars it supports each year, the earthen levee bisects both the National Butterfly Center and Bentsen-Rio Grande State Park.

About 70 percent or more of both sanctuaries will be sequestered on the south side of the wall if the president’s national emergency supersedes the congressional package. “What will happen to the animals then?” Max Munoz, the National Butterfly Center’s grounds manager, asked me.

Environmental experts have been clear: an impenetrable physical barrier cutting across the river basin will be nothing short of devastating, kick-starting the death of the remaining native ecosystem. Nevertheless, the administration has waived 23 environmental laws under the 2005 Real ID Act in order to expedite construction.

Multiple lawsuits have been filed on behalf of environmental and civil rights groups since construction equipment and surveyors were spotted here in early February. In response, the congressional package signed on February 14 includes provisions that will prohibit the construction of border-wall segments within two other wildlife sanctuaries and one historic landmark, but it still grants $1.375 billion for 55 miles of new border wall in these wildlife refuges and the area where Monty sits.

Herrera, Martinez, Treviño, and I drove up and over the levee and through the metal slats to reach Monty. When I stopped the car in a shallow patch of dirt on the other side of the wall, Treviño jumped out and skipped straight to the tree.

Herrera walked up to Monty and placed his palm at the base of a beach-ball-sized knot growing from its trunk. “Stress,” he says. Herrera points out that one of Monty’s three main branches is dying or dead.

Within five minutes, a Border Patrol helicopter begins circling overhead.

“Just ignore it,” Herrera says.

The southernmost 150 miles of the river basin known as the Rio Grande Valley is not actually a valley—it’s a delta. In the early 1900s, Anglo landowners rebranded the fertile river basin as a valley to attract ranchers and investors; their campaign transferred landownership from a Latino majority to an Anglo majority within a matter of years, even though almost the entire population remained Hispanic. Today, more than a third of Rio Grande Valley residents are living in poverty, nearly three times the national average.

“It’s easy to target these communities,” Martinez says. “[Proponents of the border wall don’t] care that they don’t have access to nature. It doesn’t matter, because it’s so easy to take it from them. It’s so easy for them to not have a voice.”

Treviño proudly calls herself a “valley kid.” She was born and raised in the river delta. So were her mom and dad, though on opposite sides of the river.

She sees the increased militarization of the Rio Grande basin and the wall cutting through it as part of a larger pattern of culture erasure, depriving future generations of valley kids of the opportunity to see the parallels between the land and themselves.

“I could see myself reflected in the thornscrub and in the native birds and in the native butterflies,” Treviño said. “The idea of my children not being able to access that is very heartbreaking.”

Monty has become a symbol for that feeling, rooted in the deep well of resilience that also supplies the Hispanic community the river delta. Last month, dozens of people affiliated with the No Border Wall Movement carried 50 jugs of water to the base of Monty’s trunk and soaked it.

After the helicopter pulls up from circling over us, I suggest we walk down the dirt road to the top of the levee.

All of a sudden, a Border Patrol suburban is raising dust at our feet. A woman leans out of the window. “What are you doing here?”

Treviño puts on her sweetest smile. “We’re just here visiting the tree, just enjoying nature!”

The woman eyes us all. “OK,” she says. “Be careful.” She repeats: “Be careful.”

It’s not just Monty, the green jays, or the ocelot that people like Treviño, Herrera, and Martinez are working to defend. It’s the health of their own roots, too; their nativity is threatened by the administration’s rhetoric and relentless pursuit of a border wall.

“These are things we can reverse, these are things we can fix. It’s a matter of speaking up and going out and doing what we can,” Herrera says.

Before we leave Monty, Herrera puts his hand on its trunk once more. I ask if it’s going to die because of the knot and the dead branch. “Oh, no,” he says. “It won’t completely die. It’s old and strong, but it could use some help.”",The 900-Year-Old Abuelo at the Border Wall,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEFgeVoDocRhklsyP9OYQ2owqFggEKg0IACoGCAow2IsBMIAdMOOarwM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.outsideonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/full-page/public/2019/03/05/monty-the-tree_h.jpg?itok=3Lze0kWu,2019-03-20,"{'sent': 'No one is certain we’ll actually make it to see Monty, a 900-year-old Montezuma bald cypress tree that’s been rooted in the Rio Grande basin since before the Aztecs rose to power, or what will happen once we get there.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Montezuma', 'Monty', 'Rio Grande']}}","No one is certain we’ll actually make it to see Monty, a 900-year-old Montezuma bald cypress tree that’s been rooted in the Rio Grande basin since before the Aztecs rose to power, or what will happen once we get there.

While we were sitting at the gas station that morning, they joked that it was good they had me, “a white girl,” with them this time. They’d all been told, via friends and the valley’s environmentalist network, that people had been recently detained by Border Patrol for visiting Monty. They’d been told not to return.

“Even folks from the region who are documented are approached, questioned, and even detained,” Treviño says. “Without question, if you go to some of these wild spaces, you are surveilled and viewed as suspect simply for being there.”

Monty stands a few miles east of McAllen, Texas, and a few miles north of Reynosa, Mexico, the border’s busiest sector. The tree is just 200 yards south of the earthen levee that runs parallel to the Rio Grande, about a mile from its bank on the edge of the river’s floodplain.

Montezuma bald cypresses require a lot of water, so much so that the Aztecs named the species ahuehue, “old man on the water”; its seeds will only germinate in water or wet soil. As time and human intervention have moved the river’s flow about a mile away, it’s near impossible to get the tree enough nutrients.

With the wall, the federal government is taking control of the Rio Grande Valley’s final surviving tracts of native ground and turning it into a no-man’s-land. For the people who call this place home, Monty, the abuelo of the Rio Grande, represents what’s at stake in the fight over the president’s “big, beautiful” barrier.

The Department of Homeland Security is building the wall on the levee in accordance with the 1970 U.S.-Mexico treaty, which prohibits physical barriers within the floodplain. The existing segments, authorized by the 2006 Secure Fence Act, provide a good example of what is to come—in March 2018, Congress approved $600 million for 33 more miles of border wall here.

The slope on the southern side of the levee has been shaved down to make a dead-vertical rise as tall as a single-story house and plastered with cement. Eighteen-foot rust-colored metal slats stand on top, framing the road that runs up and over the levee.

Less than 5 percent of the Rio Grande Valley’s native ecosystem remains unchanged or undeveloped since the 1500s.

In addition to providing habitat for the endangered ocelot, a wild cat native to the area, and the star cactus, more than 500 different bird species can be found here. It’s the confluence of two migratory paths that extend north toward Canada and south toward Mexico. The World Birding Center’s headquarters are located in the valley, in Bentsen-Rio Grande State Park, and thousands of people flock here each year to see red-crowned parrots, highlighter orange Altamira orioles, silky green jays, white-tipped doves, and more.

The Rio Grande Valley also supports one of the highest concentrations of butterflies in the country and is home to the National Butterfly Center. Nearly 150 U.S. butterfly species have no habitat left other than what’s here. According to the center, many won’t fly over a wall. Unfortunately, for both the wildlife and the people dependent on the millions of ecotourism dollars it supports each year, the earthen levee bisects both the National Butterfly Center and Bentsen-Rio Grande State Park.

About 70 percent or more of both sanctuaries will be sequestered on the south side of the wall if the president’s national emergency supersedes the congressional package. “What will happen to the animals then?” Max Munoz, the National Butterfly Center’s grounds manager, asked me.

Environmental experts have been clear: an impenetrable physical barrier cutting across the river basin will be nothing short of devastating, kick-starting the death of the remaining native ecosystem. Nevertheless, the administration has waived 23 environmental laws under the 2005 Real ID Act in order to expedite construction.

Multiple lawsuits have been filed on behalf of environmental and civil rights groups since construction equipment and surveyors were spotted here in early February. In response, the congressional package signed on February 14 includes provisions that will prohibit the construction of border-wall segments within two other wildlife sanctuaries and one historic landmark, but it still grants $1.375 billion for 55 miles of new border wall in these wildlife refuges and the area where Monty sits.

Herrera, Martinez, Treviño, and I drove up and over the levee and through the metal slats to reach Monty. When I stopped the car in a shallow patch of dirt on the other side of the wall, Treviño jumped out and skipped straight to the tree.

Herrera walked up to Monty and placed his palm at the base of a beach-ball-sized knot growing from its trunk. “Stress,” he says. Herrera points out that one of Monty’s three main branches is dying or dead.

Within five minutes, a Border Patrol helicopter begins circling overhead.

“Just ignore it,” Herrera says.

The southernmost 150 miles of the river basin known as the Rio Grande Valley is not actually a valley—it’s a delta. In the early 1900s, Anglo landowners rebranded the fertile river basin as a valley to attract ranchers and investors; their campaign transferred landownership from a Latino majority to an Anglo majority within a matter of years, even though almost the entire population remained Hispanic. Today, more than a third of Rio Grande Valley residents are living in poverty, nearly three times the national average.

“It’s easy to target these communities,” Martinez says. “[Proponents of the border wall don’t] care that they don’t have access to nature. It doesn’t matter, because it’s so easy to take it from them. It’s so easy for them to not have a voice.”

Treviño proudly calls herself a “valley kid.” She was born and raised in the river delta. So were her mom and dad, though on opposite sides of the river.

She sees the increased militarization of the Rio Grande basin and the wall cutting through it as part of a larger pattern of culture erasure, depriving future generations of valley kids of the opportunity to see the parallels between the land and themselves.

“I could see myself reflected in the thornscrub and in the native birds and in the native butterflies,” Treviño said. “The idea of my children not being able to access that is very heartbreaking.”

Monty has become a symbol for that feeling, rooted in the deep well of resilience that also supplies the Hispanic community the river delta. Last month, dozens of people affiliated with the No Border Wall Movement carried 50 jugs of water to the base of Monty’s trunk and soaked it.

After the helicopter pulls up from circling over us, I suggest we walk down the dirt road to the top of the levee.

All of a sudden, a Border Patrol suburban is raising dust at our feet. A woman leans out of the window. “What are you doing here?”

Treviño puts on her sweetest smile. “We’re just here visiting the tree, just enjoying nature!”

The woman eyes us all. “OK,” she says. “Be careful.” She repeats: “Be careful.”

It’s not just Monty, the green jays, or the ocelot that people like Treviño, Herrera, and Martinez are working to defend. It’s the health of their own roots, too; their nativity is threatened by the administration’s rhetoric and relentless pursuit of a border wall.

“These are things we can reverse, these are things we can fix. It’s a matter of speaking up and going out and doing what we can,” Herrera says.

Before we leave Monty, Herrera puts his hand on its trunk once more. I ask if it’s going to die because of the knot and the dead branch. “Oh, no,” he says. “It won’t completely die. It’s old and strong, but it could use some help.”",POLICY
80,"T he road to Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park is as flat as the rest of Texas and lined with palm trees — the tall, slender kind that arc elegantly against clear blue skies. “These are Washingtonia palms,” Patti Rubio says, one hand on the wheel, the other taping the window with her knuckle. “Some people, they’ll be like: ‘I know I’m home when I see the palms!’ But man, I see them, and the indigenous woman in me cries.”

Rubio, an environmental educator and local birding expert, talks with her whole body. When animals and plants are the subject, her large brown eyes widen, her smile broadens. But when politics come up, she rounds her shoulders and her mouth droops, unless she’s particularly enraged — then she snaps into a focused scowl, like she is right now.

Rubio works at the National Butterfly Center, a swath of privately protected land down the road from the state park. We’ve come to Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park so she can show me what makes this region of Texas, the very southeast tip, so special: its rare birds, the millions of butterflies, and the most contentious section of the U.S.-Mexico border.

We turn left onto South Bentsen Palm Drive, and she raps her knuckle against the window again as we pass a cluster of broad and stocky ebony trees, which are native to the Rio Grande Valley, she tells me. She points to a dirt pull-out, semi-hidden and shaded by the trees. Border Patrol, she says, that’s where they like to idle in their cars, though on this February morning, it’s empty. A few minutes later we pass a large stable, where Border Patrol keeps their horses, and a few minutes after that, we slow to a stop at the entrance of the state park.

Both Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park and the National Butterfly Center protect tracts of rare ecosystems along the banks of the Rio Grande River. Until two years ago, state park employees were likely the only uniformed people you’d encounter on a birding expedition or a stroll on the trails. But since the 2016 elections, Border Patrol agents are now seen with increasing frequency, as both wildlife sanctuaries extend to the edge of the water in what happens to be the busiest sector of the U.S.-Mexico border. According to Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) data, 162,000 people were apprehended in November 2018 between the cities of McAllen and Reynosa, north and south of the wildlife refuges, respectively.

The militarization of the Rio Grande Valley — ever present helicopters, patrolling agents, limited access to public and private land — has further intensified since March 2018, when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was authorized to build sections of physical barriers between McAllen and Reyonsa, on the edge of the river’s floodplain, which is anywhere between one and two miles inland and just a few hundred yards south of both sanctuaries’ visitor centers. If the wall is built, as much as 70 percent of the protected land will soon become a “no man’s land” sandwiched between the wall and the actual border line, inaccessible to private or public parties.

Rubio is part of a coalition of local folks trying to stop the wall’s construction, particularly the segments that will cut straight through these sensitive ecological areas. It feels like the Rio Grande Valley’s final frontier, in many ways; less than 5 percent of the region’s native ecosystem remains.

“Honestly, I’m exhausted,” Rubio says of her resistance-organizing efforts. “That’s the story of our lives down here, we can’t afford to stop.”

She explains their fight to preserve what’s left of the native ecosystem isn’t only about the health of the south-Texas flora and fauna; it’s also about preserving the value of their heritage and culture. Hundreds of thousands of folks in the Rio Grande Valley, like Rubio, have generational roots running far deeper than the roots of Washingtonia palms; these people have been landscaped and pruned, uprooted and manipulated just as much as the fertile river delta.

Though this area has been called the Rio Grande Valley for the past 100 years and folks today (including Rubio) identify proudly as “valley kids,” it’s not, by any definition, a valley — it’s the final 150 miles of the Rio Grande River before it spills into the Gulf of Mexico, a flat, sediment-rich riparian zone that’s been home to hundreds of flora and fauna species for centuries.

A 900-year-old Montezuma Cypress tree, for example, is rooted within the floodplain, now just 200 yards south of a section of wall that’s already been built. Endangered animals like the ocelot and plants like the star cactus have no more habitat in the U.S. (and in some cases, the world) than what remains protected right now in the Rio Grande river delta. But if DHS plans move forward as outlined in federal documents and bolstered by President Trump’s recent “national emergency” announcement, the delta will be the next site for border wall construction.

The wall is scheduled to be built on top of an earthen levee system that already exists, tracing the northern edge of the river’s floodplain, in compliance with a 1970 U.S.-Mexico treaty that prevents barrier construction within flood zones. The levees were originally intended to help create a protected natural highway of sorts for the ocelot to find mates and food, but last year, the president waived 23 environmental laws in order to expedite construction.

“Wildlife has no chance,” Rubio says. “Animals will either die of dehydration or they’ll die of starvation. They’re not going to be able to migrate to find a mate, they’re not going to be able to move safely… every living space needs space — [and] just like us, every living thing needs space.”

Before Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park became a state park, the land belonged to the Bentsen Family, whose patriarch, Lloyd Bentsen (father of the famed Texas Senator of the same name) moved to Texas from South Dakota in 1918 on the hunt for ranching, energy development and real estate opportunities. At that time, the majority of folks in the region were a mix of descendants from Spanish settlements, Mexican migrants and members of the indigenous Carrizo/Comecrudo tribe.

The elder Bentsen was part of a cohort of Anglo ranchers that introduced the term “valley” to the region as a branding mechanism — they wanted to draw more wealth and development to the area and launched a campaign eventually known as the “Magic Valley Movement.”

They gave the Valley a makeover. Native Sabal palms, shorter and with thicker fronds, were uprooted; the Washingtonia palms lined the streets instead. Grasses were planted. Roads were widened. Cheap labor, cheap land and cheap water were advertised perks. Within a decade, land ownership flipped from majority Latino to majority Anglo.

“They brought in an outside non-native plant to exploit people, and that’s what hurts,” Rubio explains. “Sometimes I look at Washingtonians, and the only thing I see is people that were taken advantage of. It does hurt because my grandparents, my aunts and uncles, my mother, they worked in the field and they weren’t given what they should have been given as far as respect, breaks, money.”

The Sabal palms were too short, too stocky for Anglo landscaping preferences. The thorn bush forests native to the delta are never treated with romantic flair like other Western landscapes. Often, Rubio feels like American society is pressuring her to get a makeover, too. Her brown skin, her glossy voluminous hair — many of her physical characteristics aren’t appreciated in a lot of mainstream American media. She sees that reflected in the world around her, too. “When I was little,” Rubio tells me, “I put Clorox in water in a sink, and I tried to bleach my skin, because I thought I was ugly because I was brown.” When her submerged forearms started to burn, she thought, “Oh good, it’s working. I’m gonna be pretty.”

She continues, “There’s this feeling of being inferior because I’m a woman of color, and the thing is, I’m not inferior, and because I’m a woman of color does not mean anything less than the person to the left or the right of me, and it just so happens the universe decided, ‘Guess what? You’re going to be this lovely shade of brown,’ and that’s just so it’s not the same old thing. That’s all it is.”

But when you aren’t taught to see value or beauty in your natural self, nor value or beauty in the natural landscape of your home, where do you cultivate a sense of value, or even an understanding of who you are in the context of where you live? Neither of us know.

Rubio and I enter Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park (on foot, no private cars are allowed) and pay the $5 admission fee. We hop in a 12-person minibus outside the visitor center, driven by a state park employee who will point out the birds and plants along the way.

First, though, we have to drive up and over the earthen levee in order to access the vast majority of the park, and the richest birding spots. Two Border Patrol trucks are idling on the levee as we drive by, their exhaust pipes emitting visible grayish fumes.

“Looks like they really care about the environment,” I say, and Rubio snorts. The state park employee can’t help but smile either. I ask the driver what’ll happen when border wall construction starts here. He declines to comment. Construction equipment and surveyors were seen in the wildlife refuge plots adjacent to the park and the National Butterfly Center at the beginning of February, just two weeks prior to this visit.

At this time, we’re all still in the throes of the longest government shutdown in history, so tensions everywhere in the Valley are high — it’s a largely democratic pocket of Texas and the majority of elected officials and folks native and non-native alike who live here year-round are outwardly opposed to even the general concept of a border wall. Rubio, like many, grew up walking back and forth across the river with her family, going out to dinner, attending church, shopping and going to the doctor in Mexico. While the militarization has made that life no longer possible, animals still depend on the ability to move freely north and south of the river, across invisible lines.

Despite the high rate of apprehended, undocumented immigrants and a poverty rate three times the national average, McAllen has consistently ranked as one of the safest cities of its size in the nation. Many folks rely on the millions of dollars of ecotourism the region generates each year. The wall would present economic and social changes to which many locals would have difficulty adjusting. Because many of them are poor and most of them are brown, Rubio believes the federal government isn’t paying those in the Rio Grande Valley the same attention or care other more privileged communities might receive. After helping support and organize the Standing Rock camp in North Dakota in 2016, Rubio sees similar power structures at play, now in her own hometown.

As we wind around the state park in the van, we’re surrounded by mesquite and ebony trees, thick tamaulipan thornscrub is sprinkled in between. We pass egg-yolk yellow Altamira orioles; green jays call out their cheh cheh cheh; large, proud and pheasant-like chachalacas squawk; a javelina (a rodent that looks like a wiry-haired pig and is as large as a medium-sized dog) waddles across a grass clearing. If you want an idea of what Texas once looked like, before the Spanish colonizers, before the Anglo ranchers, this is perhaps the best, last place left to see it.

Truth is, if the wall goes up, the park will most likely close. The National Butterfly Center, too. With so much of both sanctuaries’ land on the southern side of the levee, the fragmentation of the ecosystem will be devastating. While environmental- and human-rights groups have filed lawsuits against the federal administration, no legal action has been taken on behalf of local people.

The only solace Rubio finds now is in nature. While the Washingtonias distress her, she’s had no choice but to adapt to life under their shadow. “The only thing that brings me comfort is knowing that nature is at least benefiting [from the palms], and as we take away habitat, some are truly going to depend on that one tree to reproduce, to have their nest, to have their clutch.”

We leave the park and drive back out to South Bentsen Palm Drive. Rubio’s phone immediately starts ringing and vibrating. “Sorry, gotta look at this,” she says, pulling over.

As she sifts through the flood of messages — we’d had no cell service in the park — I watch Rubio’s shoulders, buoyed by our time in the park, round and fold again. Her lips purse into a scowl. She’s helping plan an upcoming protest. “I gotta get back home and deal with this,” she says — it’s not just flora and fauna that find peace in protected nature areas.

A few days later, on Feb. 14, the federal government reopened with a bipartisan congressional package that, at face value, might have seemed like a win for locals like Rubio. While the bill does include $1.375 billion for 55 additional miles of new border wall, it explicitly prohibits construction on the levees in Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park and the National Butterfly Center.

But it doesn’t feel like a win for Rubio. As construction and clear-cutting on the southern side of the earthen levee is still a possibility, it’s only a matter of time before the impacts of fragmentation take a toll on the rest of the remaining ecosystem. The 900-year-old Montezuma Cypress won’t be protected.

The day after the government reopened, the president declared a “national emergency,” which would then eliminate any congressional protection of the state park and butterfly sanctuary. Though Congress voted to deny the emergency with a bill, the president vetoed the bill on March 14 and continues to push for the wall’s construction across the Rio Grande Valley.

Three days after the president’s national emergency declaration, Rubio joined a few dozen folks at the base of the 900-year-old tree. They carried in jugs of water, soaking its base. For a photo, they held up a banner that read: “Roots break walls.”

Rubio told me the slogan “has meaning behind many things, like culture, heritage and the environmental part. [You know] how we see plants growing through concrete? That’s us.”","River first, border second",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJvdWxkZXJ3ZWVrbHkuY29tL25ld3Mvcml2ZXItZmlyc3QtYm9yZGVyLXNlY29uZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.boulderweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Web-cover-3.28.19.jpg,2019-03-28,"{'sent': 'T he road to Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park is as flat as the rest of Texas and lined with palm trees — the tall, slender kind that arc elegantly against clear blue skies.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['arc', 'Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park'], 'GPE': ['Texas']}}","T he road to Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park is as flat as the rest of Texas and lined with palm trees — the tall, slender kind that arc elegantly against clear blue skies. “These are Washingtonia palms,” Patti Rubio says, one hand on the wheel, the other taping the window with her knuckle. “Some people, they’ll be like: ‘I know I’m home when I see the palms!’ But man, I see them, and the indigenous woman in me cries.”

As she sifts through the flood of messages — we’d had no cell service in the park — I watch Rubio’s shoulders, buoyed by our time in the park, round and fold again. Her lips purse into a scowl. She’s helping plan an upcoming protest. “I gotta get back home and deal with this,” she says — it’s not just flora and fauna that find peace in protected nature areas.

A few days later, on Feb. 14, the federal government reopened with a bipartisan congressional package that, at face value, might have seemed like a win for locals like Rubio. While the bill does include $1.375 billion for 55 additional miles of new border wall, it explicitly prohibits construction on the levees in Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park and the National Butterfly Center.

But it doesn’t feel like a win for Rubio. As construction and clear-cutting on the southern side of the earthen levee is still a possibility, it’s only a matter of time before the impacts of fragmentation take a toll on the rest of the remaining ecosystem. The 900-year-old Montezuma Cypress won’t be protected.

The day after the government reopened, the president declared a “national emergency,” which would then eliminate any congressional protection of the state park and butterfly sanctuary. Though Congress voted to deny the emergency with a bill, the president vetoed the bill on March 14 and continues to push for the wall’s construction across the Rio Grande Valley.

Three days after the president’s national emergency declaration, Rubio joined a few dozen folks at the base of the 900-year-old tree. They carried in jugs of water, soaking its base. For a photo, they held up a banner that read: “Roots break walls.”

Rubio told me the slogan “has meaning behind many things, like culture, heritage and the environmental part. [You know] how we see plants growing through concrete? That’s us.”",POLICY
81,"The Monte Mojino Reserve, in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains, is mainly tropical dry forest. This forest type is one of the world’s most threatened ecosystems. Only 5% of tropical dry forests anywhere overlap with protected areas — putting this habitat and the species that rely on it in danger of extinction.

Rainforest Trust has worked with local partner Naturaleza y Cultura Sierra Madre since 2004 to protect and expand Monte Mojino. This month, the two organizations purchased 1,299 acres of vital habitat in the area.

The reserve is home to many notable species, including the Endangered Lilac-crowned Amazon. This parrot needs to nest in cavities, which old trees provide. But outside protected areas, such trees are falling prey to wood extraction and deforestation for cattle grazing. Poachers also target Lilac-crowned Amazons for trade. Growing Monte Mojino expands both habitat and anti-poaching safeguards, reducing two threats to this colorful and threatened bird.

The ecosystem also contains the Goode’s Thornscrub Tortoise. Researchers discovered this species in the reserve in 2016 and named it for Rainforest Trust Board Member Eric Goode. Plant-wise, the Virgin’s Palm, a rare and threatened cycad species grows in the area. Only 500-1,000 trees remain in the world, all of them in a small patch in northwestern Mexico. The area also sits on the border between the Nearctic and the Neotropical regions. Hence, it is both unique and important to global biodiversity.

Despite its ecological value, the area faces many threats. Wildfires and climate change endanger the ecosystem, but proper management can ease some of these stressors. In addition, cattle ranching is both extensive and an important part of the local economy. Thus, the local partner is engaging with communities to involve them in conservation and recognize its benefits. Besides environmental education and work opportunities, Naturaleza y Cultura is also working with children and creating a local women’s artisan cooperative. These initiatives have created a good working relationship between the partner and many of the communities and ranchers.

“Protecting this unique ecosystem was vitally important,” said Dr. Paul Salaman, CEO of Rainforest Trust. “From threatened parrots to endemic cycads, this area of Mexico is unlike anywhere else in the world and now safeguarded from growing threats.”

This project was made possible through donations to our Conservation Action Fund.

82,"When Jon Paul Rodriguez arrived on Venezuela’s Caribbean coast, the plight of the imperilled yellow-shouldered parrot was dire. Then it got even worse.

A decision to transform Margarita Island into a duty-free zone lured thousands of tourists and further reduced the habitat of the bird, coveted as a pet and routinely netted by poachers.

Three decades on, Mr Rodriguez, 51, and his Provita organisation have turned the situation around and the number of parrots has soared from just 650 to 1,700. They did this by changing people’s attitudes towards the birds, recruiting poachers to be “eco guardians” who carry out a round-the-clock watch on their nests, and establish local pride in the environment. That this was achieved amid political upheaval and even violence was all the more striking.

This week, the efforts of Mr Rodriguez and his team were recognised in London when he was named the winner of Whitley Fund for Nature’s gold award. Sometimes referred to as the “Green Oscars”, the awards honour conservationists and activists working in the most difficult circumstances. A prize of £60,000 ($78,000) will allow Mr Rodriguez’s work to continue and even expand.

Edward Whitley, founder of the Whitley fund, of which Sir David Attenborough is a trustee, said: “Jon Paul’s work has been crucial in turning the situation around for the yellow-shouldered parrot. He has worked with local communities for more than 30 years and has led his team with commitment.”

Speaking while on a recent visit to New York, Mr Rodriguez said his approach to conservation, which placed the community at the centre of efforts, had been inspired by projects elsewhere around the world in which people were made to feel they had a stake.

“Over the last two decades we hear been able to restore the birds,” he told The Independent. “We do 24-hour nest protection. We have a team of eco guardians. In the past they were poachers who caught the parrots, but now they work with us to save the birds.

“Poaching still goes on in other parts of the country – there is a domestic market for the parrots as pets, and some international trade. We can offer the poachers something different to bust and boom. We employ them for several months, when previously these men would have been fighting to catch the birds. Then we do everything we can to find employment for them doing the rest of the year.”

Venezuela is one of the richest bird habitats in the world, with 1,383 confirmed species – of which 45 are endemic. The Venezuelan troupial is its national bird.

Birds of Venezuela, a 1978 guide written by Rodolphe Meyer de Schaunesee and William Phelps, and which contains vibrant colour plates drawn by Guy Tudor, says: “The richness of the Venezuelan avifauna is attested to by the fact that about 44 per cent of all species found in South America occur within the boundaries of the republic.”

Mr Rodriguez, who was presented with his award by Princess Anne at the Royal Geographical Society, said Venezuela was once a regular destination for international birdwatchers. But tourism had fallen off as the country’s problems had exacerbated, with opposition leader Juan Guaido seeking to oust president Nicolas Maduro with the support of the US and several other countries. More than 3 million people have fled the country, and this week the capital, Caracas, saw violence as supporters of Mr Guaido clashed with security forces.

Mr Rodriguez said that away from the capital, people’s interaction with the authorities was more straightforward. He said a crucial step in safeguarding the yellow-shouldered parrot was to have it recognised as as the official, regional bird of the state of Nueva Esparta.

“We are lucky to have the support of of international groups and organisations,” he said. “This allows us to weather local challenges.”

Mr Rodriguez won his original Whitley Award in 2003 in support of his work, and has received several further funding grants from WFN since then.

He said the Whitley gold award would greatly contribute to increasing his international visibility and projecting him to the global conservation arena.

Six other conservationists have also been honoured with awards – Ghana’s Caleb Ofori-Boateng, Bulgaria’s Nikolai Petkov, Madagascar’s Vatosoa Rakotondrazafy, Argentina’s José Sarasola, Indonesia’s Wendi Tamariska and Costa Rica’s Ilena Zanella.

In 2016, Mr Rodriguez was elected Chair of IUCN’s Species Survival Commission, a global conservation organisation founded in 1948 and which has its secretariat in Switzerland. He was the first person from outside Europe or North America to hold this position.

He said he dreamed of a future for Venezuelan birdwatching and conservation in which international visitors paid for a package that included a week on the Caribbean beaches, and then three or four days in the forest, getting close up with nature.

“The country is uniquely located at the tip of South America, and there were all these different habitats – Amazon, Andean, Orinocan. In a relatively small area, you get all this diversity,” he said.

It is a sombre thought that your favourite parrot species has a high chance of being threatened with extinction in the wild. Sadly, 28 per cent of all parrot species are classified as Threatened under IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) criteria, making them one of the most imperilled bird families in the world.

Agriculture, logging, hunting, and trapping for the pet trade markets are all major threats to parrots, with the highest percentage of threatened species – 37 per cent – being found in the Neotropical region. Here, the high numbers of parrots sold in markets of large South American cities is evidence that capture can be to satisfy the domestic demand for pets. Without doubt the poaching of parrots constitutes a major threat, but the relative impacts of domestic consumption versus international trade still require greater clarity.

Assessments of the impact of poaching on wild parrot populations still rely substantially on qualitative rather than quantitative data. Therefore, further research intended to measure simultaneously the actual abundances of parrots in the wild and numbers of parrots poached can help to determine with greater accuracy the true impact of poaching on different populations and species of parrots. At the same time, more research is needed to assess the actual impact of parrot poaching compared to that of habitat loss and degradation. Many species may be considerably affected negatively by logging and agriculture, while others may adapt well to human-altered habitats.

The necessary research on a large geographical scale is now under way in a project supported by the Loro Parque Fundación. The researchers, based in Spain but all experienced in field work with parrots, have an enormous distance to travel. There are 22 study areas to survey, in South and Central America and the Caribbean, from Mexico and Hispaniola in the north to Chile and Argentina in the south. These areas cover a variety of continental and island biomes from lowlands to highlands, and from tropical dry forests to mountain rainforests. The study areas were selected to include different biomes and parrot communities as well as different countries and cultures, since the intensity of both habitat loss and parrot poaching may vary between them.

Within each study area the researchers are conducting roadside surveys of the parrots and their habitats. This means driving slowly along mostly unpaved roads, which cover apparently well-conserved habitats as well as altered ones, agricultural land and urbanized areas, avoiding the middle of the day when parrot activity is reduced. They stop each time parrots are heard or sighted to identify the species, flock size, their activity and distance to the observer using a laser rangefinder. When parrots are foraging, their behaviour, the foodplant species, parts of the plant eaten and eventual seed dispersions are recorded to advance the knowledge of their ecological functions. Habitats crossed through the roadside transects are scored into five types in a gradient of habitat deterioration, from natural habitat to urban (areas occupied by small villages and human settlements). The length (in km) of each patch of the habitat of the five types is recorded, as is the number of observed parrots of each species in the patch.



Researcher Pedro Romero looking for parrots in a deforested area (Jose Luis Tella).

Information about parrot poaching is gathered from informal interviews with people living in local communities and isolated houses evenly distributed through the study areas and conducted outside of the roadside survey times. People are usually unaware of the illegality of parrot poaching, so they are not reluctant to be interviewed and to show their pets to the researchers. When possible, the researchers take photos of the pets and ask the owners if they caught them or bought them (in such case where and at what cost), if the parrot was caught as chick or adult and how, the current age of the parrot, the welfare conditions of pets, if the parrot is free (with wing feathers cut) or caged, which member of the family takes care of the pet, if they caught more parrots and what was their destination (sold or given away, to whom and to where). The researchers also ask whether they had more parrots before and if they died, escaped, were predated or were sold, and what was the age of the parrot at that time.



Turquoise-fronted and Southern Mealy Amazons for sale at a market in Bolivia (Mauricio Herrera).

The project benefits from the inclusion of the researchers' unpublished information obtained during the previous seven years of conducting field work in different countries, biomes and parrot communities, with about 35,000 km covered for systematic roadside census, about 160,000 parrots recorded in the wild and thousands recorded as pets, of 65 species ranging in size from the smallest parrotlets to the largest macaws. Some results already published, about the endangered Red-fronted Macaw endemic to inter-Andean valleys of Bolivia, show that the species is not currently threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation but rather by the intensive capture of both nestlings and adults for use as pets. Most macaws are kept by the trappers at home as pets, and only a small fraction (2.8 per cent) are transported to be sold in Los Pozos market, the main wildlife market of Bolivia situated in Santa Cruz de la Sierra (where the Loro Parque Fundación independently financed a study of the species and volume of parrots in trade there). The researchers' study suggests that the real volume of parrots poached is much higher than that estimated by simply surveying Los Pozos market.

In addition to the findings of the research, an important element will be public awareness, and therefore the results are expected to be disseminated in international conferences, high-impact scientific journals, popular journals and a diversity of media outlets. The dissemination of the findings to local collaborating NGOs, local communities and other stakeholders across different Latin American countries will be a priority. This is because a number of successor projects is expected, namely that Latin American NGOs and conservationist groups will locally apply the most needed conservation actions highlighted by the current project. The results are eagerly awaited.",The impacts of habitat loss and poaching on Neotropical parrots,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpcmRndWlkZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2NvbnNlcnZhdGlvbi90aGUtaW1wYWN0cy1vZi1oYWJpdGF0LWxvc3MtYW5kLXBvYWNoaW5nLW9uLW5lb3Ryb3BpY2FsLXBhcnJvdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.birdguides-cdn.com/cdn/articles/4-Pet-A-festiva-with-indigenous-people-in-Peru_Juan-Carlos-Huayllapuma-CIFOR_.jpg?&width=1200&height=630&mode=crop,2019-05-04,"{'sent': 'Sadly, 28 per cent of all parrot species are classified as Threatened under IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) criteria, making them one of the most imperilled bird families in the world.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['28 per cent'], 'ORG': ['IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of Nature'], 'CARDINAL': ['one']}}","636d486c-2cbe-4d67-81e7-eada42ebbcf8

When possible, the researchers take photos of the pets and ask the owners if they caught them or bought them (in such case where and at what cost), if the parrot was caught as chick or adult and how, the current age of the parrot, the welfare conditions of pets, if the parrot is free (with wing feathers cut) or caged, which member of the family takes care of the pet, if they caught more parrots and what was their destination (sold or given away, to whom and to where). The researchers also ask whether they had more parrots before and if they died, escaped, were predated or were sold, and what was the age of the parrot at that time.

The project benefits from the inclusion of the researchers' unpublished information obtained during the previous seven years of conducting field work in different countries, biomes and parrot communities, with about 35,000 km covered for systematic roadside census, about 160,000 parrots recorded in the wild and thousands recorded as pets, of 65 species ranging in size from the smallest parrotlets to the largest macaws. Some results already published, about the endangered Red-fronted Macaw endemic to inter-Andean valleys of Bolivia, show that the species is not currently threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation but rather by the intensive capture of both nestlings and adults for use as pets. Most macaws are kept by the trappers at home as pets, and only a small fraction (2.8 per cent) are transported to be sold in Los Pozos market, the main wildlife market of Bolivia situated in Santa Cruz de la Sierra (where the Loro Parque Fundación independently financed a study of the species and volume of parrots in trade there). The researchers' study suggests that the real volume of parrots poached is much higher than that estimated by simply surveying Los Pozos market.

In addition to the findings of the research, an important element will be public awareness, and therefore the results are expected to be disseminated in international conferences, high-impact scientific journals, popular journals and a diversity of media outlets. The dissemination of the findings to local collaborating NGOs, local communities and other stakeholders across different Latin American countries will be a priority. This is because a number of successor projects is expected, namely that Latin American NGOs and conservationist groups will locally apply the most needed conservation actions highlighted by the current project. The results are eagerly awaited.",POACHING
84,"A conservationist striving to protect hammerhead sharks in Costa Rica has been honored with a prestigious Whitley Award* by HRH The Princess Royal on May 1.

Ilena Zanella, Co-founder of marine conservation organization Misión Tiburón (Shark Mission), is working to protect scalloped hammerhead sharks from illegal fishing.

Her work is based in the Golfo Dulce, located at the South of the Province of Puntarenas. one of the only four tropical fjords in the world where the nutrient cycle means its waters teem with wildlife, including whales and dolphins.

Following nine years of research and shark tagging in the area, Ilena proved the site is a crucial nursery habitat for young scalloped hammerhead sharks. The site was declared a Scalloped Hammerhead Shark Sanctuary in May 2018 due to her research, including a 4,000-hectare “no-take” zone – this is the first shark sanctuary in Costa Rica.

Sharks are under constant threat from illegal fishing in the coastal wetlands of Costa Rica’s Golfo Dulce. Young sharks are vulnerable to a variety of nets, while in oceanic waters, adults are captured by longlines.

The GOLFO DULCE is one of only four tropical fjords in the world. The unique nutrient cycling at this site means its waters are teeming with life.

With her Whitley Award, Ilena will work with local communities to reduce the use of juvenile scalloped hammerheads as fishing bait and improve detection of illegal fishing activity. She aims to strengthen relationships between coastguards and fishers to halve illegal catch of hammerheads, and plans to establish an Education Station to engage students in conservation.

“During my early work I visited many fishing communities, and in almost every community I visited, I found dead juvenile hammerhead sharks. This alarmed me a lot and, since then, I started to work on the identification and protection of hammerhead nursery areas. With my Whitley Award, I hope to engage communities in the protection of the scalloped hammerhead shark and I would like the local people to feel proud of the new Golfo Dulce sanctuary,” said Ilena.

Ilena collaborates with other Whitley Award winners to strengthen protection for hammerheads throughout their life across the Eastern Tropical Pacific corridor – a swim-way which connects migratory shark populations in Costa Rica, Ecuador, Colombia and Panama.

“The conservation of marine life has been a popular topic in the media thanks to programmes like Blue Planet II. We’re especially honored to be supporting Ilena and her organization, which is committed to protecting sharks from the beginning of their life, ensuring safe natural habitats for them to grow and develop, in collaboration with other Whitley Award winners in Latin America,” said Edward Whitley, Founder of the Whitley Fund for Nature.

88,"Vampire finches!

For half the year, a little brown bird on the northernmost islands of the Galapagos uses its wickedly sharp beak to pick at seeds, nectar and insects. But when the climate dries out, it drinks blood. Yes, there is such a thing as a vampire finch. Yes, it is what it sounds like. Galapagos finches have been used since Darwin’s time to illustrate evolution in action. Even among them, Geospiza septentrionalis is an outlier, one of the few birds in the world to intentionally draw and drink blood. And the species is found only on Wolf and Darwin islands, two of the most remote and off-limits places in the entire archipelago.

The vampire finch has a method. First, one bird hops on the back of a resting nazca booby, pecks at the base of the seabird’s wing, and drinks. Blood stains the booby’s white feathers. Other finches crowd around to wait their turn, or to watch and learn. Because adult boobies can fly away, the attacks are seldom fatal. The only casualties are chicks that flee from the finches on foot and, unable to find their way back, starve.

Drinking blood is an unusual diet, and research published last year showed vampire finches have evolved specialised bacteria in their guts to aid digestion. Even more surprising, according to a paper last week in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, is that some of these bacteria are similar to ones found in the vampire bats of Central and South America.

Se Jin Song, a biologist at the University of California San Diego and the study’s lead author, had previously studied the convergent evolution of gut bacteria. Do disparate animals with the equivalent of fad diets – eating only ants and termites, for instance – develop similar gut microbiota over evolutionary time? Vampire finches, first spotted in 1964, provided Song with a chance to look across the guts of blood-drinkers from different branches of the tree of life. “When I found out about vampire finches I was pretty shocked,” she said.

Blood-drinking finches don’t have it easy. They only resort to their vampiric diet in lean times, and blood is dangerously high in salt and iron – and low in essential nutrients such as B vitamins. Vampire bats face the same dietary challenges. As Song’s team showed in their paper, the two gut microbiomes did have one ingredient in common that could help with digesting blood: high levels of Peptostreptococcaceae, a group of bacteria thought to help process sodium and iron.

Song’s co-authors, Jaime Chaves, of the University of San Francisco de Quito, in Ecuador, and Daniel Baldassare, a fellow biologist, are testing whether the finches have also evolved any of the pain-numbing or anti-clotting proteins that vampire bats use on their victims.

French wine with a 900-year-old vintage

Savagnin blanc – not to be confused with the sauvignon blanc the sommelier recommended with your cheese course – is a fruity, acidic grape from the hills of Jura, near France’s border with Switzerland. And if you sample the region’s white wines, you’ll be tasting the exact same grape, down to the genetic level, that has gone into its wines for some 900 years.

“It’s kind of frozen in time,” said Nathan Wales, an archaeologist and lead author of a new paper in the journal Nature Plants. “I had assumed that they were just recycling the names, and lineages would come and go, but we can see that’s not the case.”

The study followed an analysis of the DNA of 28 grape seeds found in wells and latrines at various archaeological sites in France, where crushed wine grapes were dumped, or simply excreted by animals or people who ate them. Wales’ team then compared those sequences to GrapeReSeq, a genetic bank for contemporary wine grapes.

Their findings reinforce how winemakers can devote centuries of loyalty to certain varieties of grapes. Faced with the choice of letting nature takes its course and allowing new grape varieties to develop, or sticking with a reliable fruit by grafting vines to create perfect clones, most growers have spent the last 10 or 20 centuries learning how to better produce what works.

The new DNA results are consistent with historical records, which had suggested viticulture in this region goes back at least 2,000 years. Back in the first century, when Roman vineyards dotted southern France, Pliny the Elder described 91 grape varieties. He also described the grafting technique still commonly used for cloning grapevines. But it hasn’t been easy to link the Roman names he used to current vines.

Wales’ team found continuity that might reach back to Pliny’s age. In La Madeleine, a church complex in the city of New Orleans, a seed found in an almost 1,000-year-old cesspit turned out to be an exact match for modern-day savagnin blanc.

Great memories... and even better noses

Elephants keep surprising us. They live complex social lives, cooperate, show altruism and grieve their dead. And now, in the latest evidence of their sophisticated cognitive abilities, elephants appear to be able to distinguish relative amounts of food merely by smell, researchers say. The findings, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, suggests elephants’ olfactory worlds are richer and more informative than ours.

Many tests of animal cognition rely on vision – an elephant or a crow is shown, say, two buckets with different amounts of food, and prompted to choose between them. Some species do quite well at this task, suggesting they can make visual estimates of quantity. Others don’t seem to notice the difference. But such visual tests overlook that other senses, like smell and hearing, may be even more important to how some animals navigate the world.

Elephants raise their trunks up like a submarine periscope to sniff their environment, potentially gathering information to aid in decision-making, said Joshua Plotnik, a professor of psychology at Hunter College in New York, an author of the new study. To see if elephants could distinguish different amounts of food using only scent, Plotnik and his colleagues devised a series of experiments that were performed at the Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp and Resort in Chiang Rai, Thailand.

Six Asian elephants were presented with pairs of plastic buckets, one of which had more sunflower seeds than the other, in a range of ratios. The buckets were covered with lids that the elephants could not see through, but with holes that smells could escape through. The elephants were allowed to choose one bucket to open and eat.

As researchers analysed the elephants’ selections, they found something surprising in some of the tests. “Remarkably, when we put two different quantities in the buckets, the elephants consistently chose the quantity that had more over less,” Plotnik said.

Deep-sea dragonfish’s transparent teeth are stronger than piranhas’

Unassuming dragonfish lurk more than 1,600ft under the surface of the ocean. Dark, eel-like and roughly 3.5in long, these deep-sea creatures glow with bioluminescence and have evolved a sensory system that allows them to detect even the subtlest movements in the ocean’s shadowy realms, then attract and capture their prey.

In a new paper published in the journal Matter, scientists demonstrated another layer of complexity to the dragonfish: the thin, jagged teeth of the species Aristostomias scintillans are made of nanoscale-size crystal particles. The composition of these nanocrystals make the dragonfish’s fangs transparent and stronger than the teeth of some of the fiercest fish predators, including great white sharks and piranhas.

The new findings have intrigued both marine biologists and material scientists. Dragonfish aren’t strong swimmers, so researchers have wondered how they eat. For material scientists, understanding the details of dragonfish teeth could help lead to new synthetic materials that are both strong and transparent, said Emanuela Del Gado, a material physicist at Georgetown University in Washington DC.

Marc A Meyers, lead author of the new paper and a materials scientist at the University of California, San Diego, has long studied animals for inspiration to develop novel materials. In the beaks of toucans, the shells of abalones and leatherback turtles, and the scales of pangolins and alligators, he has discovered structures that, when synthesised or mimicked in the lab, could have potential real-world applications.

When Meyers and his colleagues took a closer look at the dragonfish teeth using electron microscopy, they were surprised to discover tiny crystals, ranging from five to 20 nanometers in diameter, embedded throughout the teeth. “At first, we thought that it was some type of glass,” Meyers said. The structure differed from the enamel in human teeth.

The composition of these nanocrystals make the teeth not only strong but transparent. Dragonfish may have evolved such teeth to help them become effective predators. “Their wide-open mouth, armed with transparent, sabre-like teeth, effectively disappear in the surrounding blackness,” said Jacqueline Webb, a fish biologist at the University of Rhode Island. Neither Webb nor Del Gado were involved in the study.

Finding patterns in nature

Next time you go outside, take a minute to look at your local leaf arrangements. You’ll probably notice a few different patterns. In basil plants, each leaf is about 90 degrees – a quarter-turn – from the last, a template called “decussate”. Bamboo leaves are directly opposite each other, or “distichous”, while the spiral aloe plant forms a swirl that follows the Fibonacci sequence.

And then there’s Orixa japonica. The shrub, which is common in Japan, has glossy green leaves that are arranged asymmetrically, in a kind of spinning stagger-step. If you begin with the oldest leaf and move up the twig, the next will be 180 degrees away. The third leaf is 90 degrees from the second, the fourth 180 degrees from the third, and the fifth 270 degrees from the fourth. After that, the sequence starts again.

A few other unrelated plants, including the red-flowered torch lily of South Africa and a popular flowering tree called the crepe myrtle, also display this leaf layout, which is called “orixate” after its main showcase. It’s a “peculiar pattern” previously unexplained by science, said Munetaka Sugiyama, a plant physiologist at the University of Tokyo. In a study published in PLOS Computational Biology, Sugiyama and his colleagues present the first mathematical model that successfully accounts for this unusual arrangement.

Sugiyama, who often walks past Orixa japonica shrubs at his university’s botanical gardens, has long been intrigued by leaf arrangements, or phyllotaxis. But it was “just my hobby”, he said, until he found a kindred spirit in Takaaki Yonekura, now a graduate student. About five years ago, he joined Sugiyama’s lab, and the two began studying orixate patterns.

“I was so excited at the topic,” Yonekura said. The researchers started with an existing phyllotaxis equation called the Douady and Couder 2 model, or DC2. Developed in 1996, the DC2 model is based on the assumption that each leaf exerts a chemical “inhibitory power” on the area surrounding it – a sort of force field that prevents other leaves from growing. The force peters off with distance until it disappears, allowing new leaves to form.",Science news in brief: From blood-sucking finches to 900-year-old grapes,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEHIGD3MeHwwc4cKXqCzgqC8qFggEKg4IACoGCAowzdp7ML-3CTCtyxU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/06/19/16/science-news-brief-1.jpg,2019-06-19,"{'sent': 'Galapagos finches have been used since Darwin’s time to illustrate evolution in action.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Darwin']}}","Vampire finches!

For half the year, a little brown bird on the northernmost islands of the Galapagos uses its wickedly sharp beak to pick at seeds, nectar and insects. But when the climate dries out, it drinks blood. Yes, there is such a thing as a vampire finch. Yes, it is what it sounds like. Galapagos finches have been used since Darwin’s time to illustrate evolution in action. Even among them, Geospiza septentrionalis is an outlier, one of the few birds in the world to intentionally draw and drink blood. And the species is found only on Wolf and Darwin islands, two of the most remote and off-limits places in the entire archipelago.

The vampire finch has a method. First, one bird hops on the back of a resting nazca booby, pecks at the base of the seabird’s wing, and drinks. Blood stains the booby’s white feathers. Other finches crowd around to wait their turn, or to watch and learn. Because adult boobies can fly away, the attacks are seldom fatal. The only casualties are chicks that flee from the finches on foot and, unable to find their way back, starve.

Drinking blood is an unusual diet, and research published last year showed vampire finches have evolved specialised bacteria in their guts to aid digestion. Even more surprising, according to a paper last week in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, is that some of these bacteria are similar to ones found in the vampire bats of Central and South America.

Se Jin Song, a biologist at the University of California San Diego and the study’s lead author, had previously studied the convergent evolution of gut bacteria. Do disparate animals with the equivalent of fad diets – eating only ants and termites, for instance – develop similar gut microbiota over evolutionary time? Vampire finches, first spotted in 1964, provided Song with a chance to look across the guts of blood-drinkers from different branches of the tree of life. “When I found out about vampire finches I was pretty shocked,” she said.

Blood-drinking finches don’t have it easy. They only resort to their vampiric diet in lean times, and blood is dangerously high in salt and iron – and low in essential nutrients such as B vitamins. Vampire bats face the same dietary challenges. As Song’s team showed in their paper, the two gut microbiomes did have one ingredient in common that could help with digesting blood: high levels of Peptostreptococcaceae, a group of bacteria thought to help process sodium and iron.

Song’s co-authors, Jaime Chaves, of the University of San Francisco de Quito, in Ecuador, and Daniel Baldassare, a fellow biologist, are testing whether the finches have also evolved any of the pain-numbing or anti-clotting proteins that vampire bats use on their victims.

French wine with a 900-year-old vintage

Savagnin blanc – not to be confused with the sauvignon blanc the sommelier recommended with your cheese course – is a fruity, acidic grape from the hills of Jura, near France’s border with Switzerland. And if you sample the region’s white wines, you’ll be tasting the exact same grape, down to the genetic level, that has gone into its wines for some 900 years.

“It’s kind of frozen in time,” said Nathan Wales, an archaeologist and lead author of a new paper in the journal Nature Plants. “I had assumed that they were just recycling the names, and lineages would come and go, but we can see that’s not the case.”

The study followed an analysis of the DNA of 28 grape seeds found in wells and latrines at various archaeological sites in France, where crushed wine grapes were dumped, or simply excreted by animals or people who ate them. Wales’ team then compared those sequences to GrapeReSeq, a genetic bank for contemporary wine grapes.

Their findings reinforce how winemakers can devote centuries of loyalty to certain varieties of grapes. Faced with the choice of letting nature takes its course and allowing new grape varieties to develop, or sticking with a reliable fruit by grafting vines to create perfect clones, most growers have spent the last 10 or 20 centuries learning how to better produce what works.

The new DNA results are consistent with historical records, which had suggested viticulture in this region goes back at least 2,000 years. Back in the first century, when Roman vineyards dotted southern France, Pliny the Elder described 91 grape varieties. He also described the grafting technique still commonly used for cloning grapevines. But it hasn’t been easy to link the Roman names he used to current vines.

Wales’ team found continuity that might reach back to Pliny’s age. In La Madeleine, a church complex in the city of New Orleans, a seed found in an almost 1,000-year-old cesspit turned out to be an exact match for modern-day savagnin blanc.

Great memories... and even better noses

Elephants keep surprising us. They live complex social lives, cooperate, show altruism and grieve their dead. And now, in the latest evidence of their sophisticated cognitive abilities, elephants appear to be able to distinguish relative amounts of food merely by smell, researchers say. The findings, reported in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, suggests elephants’ olfactory worlds are richer and more informative than ours.

Many tests of animal cognition rely on vision – an elephant or a crow is shown, say, two buckets with different amounts of food, and prompted to choose between them. Some species do quite well at this task, suggesting they can make visual estimates of quantity. Others don’t seem to notice the difference. But such visual tests overlook that other senses, like smell and hearing, may be even more important to how some animals navigate the world.

Elephants raise their trunks up like a submarine periscope to sniff their environment, potentially gathering information to aid in decision-making, said Joshua Plotnik, a professor of psychology at Hunter College in New York, an author of the new study. To see if elephants could distinguish different amounts of food using only scent, Plotnik and his colleagues devised a series of experiments that were performed at the Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp and Resort in Chiang Rai, Thailand.

Six Asian elephants were presented with pairs of plastic buckets, one of which had more sunflower seeds than the other, in a range of ratios. The buckets were covered with lids that the elephants could not see through, but with holes that smells could escape through. The elephants were allowed to choose one bucket to open and eat.

As researchers analysed the elephants’ selections, they found something surprising in some of the tests. “Remarkably, when we put two different quantities in the buckets, the elephants consistently chose the quantity that had more over less,” Plotnik said.

Deep-sea dragonfish’s transparent teeth are stronger than piranhas’

Unassuming dragonfish lurk more than 1,600ft under the surface of the ocean. Dark, eel-like and roughly 3.5in long, these deep-sea creatures glow with bioluminescence and have evolved a sensory system that allows them to detect even the subtlest movements in the ocean’s shadowy realms, then attract and capture their prey.

In a new paper published in the journal Matter, scientists demonstrated another layer of complexity to the dragonfish: the thin, jagged teeth of the species Aristostomias scintillans are made of nanoscale-size crystal particles. The composition of these nanocrystals make the dragonfish’s fangs transparent and stronger than the teeth of some of the fiercest fish predators, including great white sharks and piranhas.

The new findings have intrigued both marine biologists and material scientists. Dragonfish aren’t strong swimmers, so researchers have wondered how they eat. For material scientists, understanding the details of dragonfish teeth could help lead to new synthetic materials that are both strong and transparent, said Emanuela Del Gado, a material physicist at Georgetown University in Washington DC.

93,"Rare tortoises, nesting and migratory birds, unique lizards and a variety of mammals are set to benefit from the recent purchase of a 18,850-acre former cattle ranch, Rancho Guimbalete, in Mexico’s Chihuahuan Desert. Rainforest Trust, Turtle Conservancy and its local affiliate HABIO, A.C. and Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC) partnered on a deal to purchase the ranch, which will be converted into a desert wildlife refuge.

Rancho Guimbalete, which is in the state of Coahuila on the northern edge of the Bolsón de Mapimí Biosphere Reserve, covers a large tract of mostly undamaged Chihuahuan desert vegetation and is home to a range of resident and migratory wildlife. This includes the Critically Endangered Bolson Tortoise, which “was recently uplisted from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature,” said Stephanie Wester, Latin America Conservation Officer at Rainforest Trust. “It is incredible that over 18,000 acres are now protected for this species and other wildlife.”

Rancho Guimbalete is also home to lizards that live only in the local sand dunes, nesting birds and migratory birds that stop to feed and rest at the seasonal wetlands and a variety of resident mammals, such as kangaroo rats, Mule Deer and Pumas. The ranch is also home to an incredible diversity of cacti, herbs and shrub species.

“Wild desert landscapes all over northern Mexico are being lost to overgrazing and, even worse, conversion to irrigated crop agriculture,” said Eric Goode, president of Turtle Conservancy. “These drylands cannot sustain agriculture for very long. But when exploiting them, native plants and animals are lost, and the landscape is forever changed for the worse. We lose wilderness, and we can never replace that.”

Under the leadership of HABIO, A.C., a Mexican NGO dedicated to biodiversity conservation in the country’s northern deserts, the ranch will now be managed primarily to protect the biodiversity found there. The ranch will also serve as a buffer zone for the neighboring Bolsón de Mapimí Biosphere Reserve, which the Mexican government established in 1977 and is a candidate Key Biodiversity Area. The site of global importance for the persistence of biodiversity.

“We are particularly grateful to the previous owners of the ranch, who used it to raise cattle but did it in an environmentally sensitive way,” said Peter Paul van Dijk, a senior associate scientist with GWC. “They prevented overgrazing and resisted the temptation to introduce damaging non-native grass species as fodder for their cows. Their care for the land safeguarded its biodiversity.”

In addition to putting an end to cattle grazing — which will help spur the recovery of grasslands habitat — HABIO, A.C. will implement management strategies that minimize erosion, encourage vegetation recovery, increase water availability for native wildlife and prevent agricultural land use.

“The purchase of Rancho Guimbalete by HABIO, so that it can be managed in the future for biodiversity conservation, represents a significant step forward for the conservation of the Bolsón de Mapimi’s unique biology and landscape,” said Judith Rios, treasurer of HABIO, A.C.

As many as 200 bird species, 70 mammal species, and 50 reptile and amphibian species potentially live in or use the ranch habitat, though future surveys will confirm the exact number of species that will benefit from the protection of the ranch. Habitat destruction and poaching are the biggest threats to the wildlife that live here, in addition to more severe droughts that result from climate change.

Rainforest Trust, Turtle Conservancy and its local affiliate HABIO, A.C. and Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC) partnered on a deal to purchase the ranch, which will be converted into a desert wildlife refuge.

Rancho Guimbalete, which is in the state of Coahuila on the northern edge of the Bolsón de Mapimí Biosphere Reserve, covers a large tract of mostly undamaged Chihuahuan desert vegetation and is home to a range of resident and migratory wildlife. This includes the Critically Endangered Bolson Tortoise, which “was recently uplisted from Vulnerable to Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature,” said Stephanie Wester, Latin America Conservation Officer at Rainforest Trust. “It is incredible that over 18,000 acres are now protected for this species and other wildlife.”

Rancho Guimbalete is also home to lizards that live only in the local sand dunes, nesting birds and migratory birds that stop to feed and rest at the seasonal wetlands and a variety of resident mammals, such as kangaroo rats, Mule Deer and Pumas. The ranch is also home to an incredible diversity of cacti, herbs and shrub species.

“Wild desert landscapes all over northern Mexico are being lost to overgrazing and, even worse, conversion to irrigated crop agriculture,” said Eric Goode, president of Turtle Conservancy. “These drylands cannot sustain agriculture for very long. But when exploiting them, native plants and animals are lost, and the landscape is forever changed for the worse. We lose wilderness, and we can never replace that.”

Under the leadership of HABIO, A.C., a Mexican NGO dedicated to biodiversity conservation in the country’s northern deserts, the ranch will now be managed primarily to protect the biodiversity found there. The ranch will also serve as a buffer zone for the neighboring Bolsón de Mapimí Biosphere Reserve, which the Mexican government established in 1977 and is a candidate Key Biodiversity Area. The site of global importance for the persistence of biodiversity.

“We are particularly grateful to the previous owners of the ranch, who used it to raise cattle but did it in an environmentally sensitive way,” said Peter Paul van Dijk, a senior associate scientist with GWC. “They prevented overgrazing and resisted the temptation to introduce damaging non-native grass species as fodder for their cows. Their care for the land safeguarded its biodiversity.”

In addition to putting an end to cattle grazing — which will help spur the recovery of grasslands habitat — HABIO, A.C. will implement management strategies that minimize erosion, encourage vegetation recovery, increase water availability for native wildlife and prevent agricultural land use.

“The purchase of Rancho Guimbalete by HABIO, so that it can be managed in the future for biodiversity conservation, represents a significant step forward for the conservation of the Bolsón de Mapimi’s unique biology and landscape,” said Judith Rios, treasurer of HABIO, A.C.

As many as 200 bird species, 70 mammal species, and 50 reptile and amphibian species potentially live in or use the ranch habitat, though future surveys will confirm the exact number of species that will benefit from the protection of the ranch. Habitat destruction and poaching are the biggest threats to the wildlife that live here, in addition to more severe droughts that result from climate change.

This purchase was made possible through the generous support of the Rainforest Trust Conservation Action Fund and SAVES Challenge, the Turtle Conservancy and Global Wildlife Conservation.

94,"Waterfalls are some of the most beautiful and impressive things in nature but, be careful, some of them might actually be man-made!

Here, we uncover five examples of man-made waterfalls from around the world and answer some common questions about waterfalls in general.

RELATED: 10 INCREDIBLE UNDERWATER ATTRACTIONS ACROSS THE GLOBE

What are the different types of waterfalls?

According to sites like worldatlas.com, there are actually up to 10 different classifications of a waterfall. These classifications tend to center around how water descends.

Natural waterfalls tend to fall into one of the following types:

Punchbowl Waterfalls - These have a wide catch pool at the bottom, and they tend to be more tranquil than other more violent falls. The name is derived from the falls of the same name in Eagle Creek, Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Oregon.

Plunge Waterfalls - As the name suggests, these type of waterfalls are characterized by a vertical flow of water that loses contact with exposed bedrock. Good examples are Blencoe Falls and Curtis Falls, in Australia.

Multi-step Waterfalls - Again, as the name suggests, these are waterfalls that cascade over a series of steps or tiers. Examples include the Ouzoud Falls in Morocco and the Fukuroda Falls in Japan.

Horsetail Waterfalls - ""The - ""The Horsetail Waterfall keeps contact with the hard rock behind it as it surges down to its pool. This type is a more common waterfall and [is found] almost everywhere in many countries from all around the world,"" according to worldatlas.com

Frozen Waterfalls - These are, obviously, waterfalls that have become frozen for some time.

F an Waterfalls - These waterfalls are characterized by a fan-like shape as the water descends into its pool. Examples include Virgin Falls in Canada and Dip Falls in Australia.

Chutes - These are pressurized waterfalls where large volumes of water are squeezed through a narrow passage. They tend to have very strong currents, and examples include Three Chites Galls in Yosemite

Cataracts - More on these later.

Cascades - ""The Cascade Waterfall has a series of rock levels on which it falls. It is also one of the more beautiful and gentle types of falls,"" according to - ""The Cascade Waterfall has a series of rock levels on which it falls. It is also one of the more beautiful and gentle types of falls,"" according to worldatlas.com . Examples include Murchison Falls in Uganda.

Block Waterfalls - Examples include the Blue Nile Falls in Ethiopia. These waterfalls are some of the more powerful and thunderous. They flow down their waterline from a wide river or stream.

- Examples include the Blue Nile Falls in Ethiopia. These waterfalls are some of the more powerful and thunderous. They Segmented - These waterfalls are formed from distinct, separate flows of water as it descends. Examples include Florence Falls in Australia.

What is a cataract waterfall?

According to the Encyclopedia Britannica, a cataract waterfall is ""a waterfall, especially one containing great volumes of water rushing over a precipice.""

These types of waterfall occur when large amounts of fast-moving water, fall off a cliff. They tend to be characterized by their sheer impressive size and power.

Cataract waterfalls are one of the most awe-inspiring natural sights in the world and one of the most impressive types of a waterfall you'll ever see.

""Famous among the world's cataract waterfalls are the [Iguazu] Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. The waterfall is known for having one of the highest flow rates of any in the world. It even tops the famous Victoria Falls along the borders of Zambia and Zimbabwe.

In 2014, Iguazu Falls recorded an all-time high in its flow rate, carrying 46,300 cubic meters per second — 33 times the usual water flow rate — after torrential rains,"" notes mnn.com.

5 of the world's biggest man-made waterfalls

Here are five of the world's most impressive and biggest man-made waterfalls. This list is far from exhaustive and is in no particular order.

1. This Chinese skyscraper has a big one

One of the world's largest man-made waterfalls can actually be found on a skyscraper in China. Making a striking addition to the building's facade, this 108-meter ""waterfall"" cascades from the Liebian International Building's top levels.

The skyscraper is located in the Chinese city of Guiyang and the architects’ vision was to “create a feeling of water and greenery, even when you are surrounded by skyscrapers.”

The waterfall is rarely turned on as it is 'eye wateringly' (pun intended) expensive to run.

2. Cascata delle Marmore is pretty impressive

The Cascata delle Marmore is an ancient artificial waterfall with a total height of 165 meters, which, according to sites like Amusingplanet.com, makes it the tallest man-made waterfall in the world.

It appears to have been created by the Romans as a means of mitigating perceived health risks from wetlands formed by the source of the waterfall, the river Velino. ""To remove that threat to the city of Rieti, in 271 BC, the Roman consul Manius Curius Dentatus ordered the construction of a canal (the Curiano Trench) to divert the stagnant waters into the natural cliff at Marmore,"" says Wikipedia.

The waterfall consists of three discrete sections with the topmost the tallest part at around 83 meters. It is located in the Italian region of Umbria, just under 8km from Terni.

3. Viktoriapark, Berlin is another impressive man-made waterfall

An urban park built in the Kreuzberg region of Berlin, Germany, Viktoriapark officially opened its doors to the public in 1894. One of its standout features is its impressive man-made waterfall.

Designed by Hermann Mächtig, the waterfalls are thought to have been inspired by natural examples around Germany. The waterfall ran for the first time in 1893 with the water pumps powered by gas motors.

The park and the waterfall's pumphouse were severely damaged during allied bombing in WW2 but were later repaired after the war.

4. The Jurong Bird Park has another big man-made waterfall

The Jurong Bird Park's Waterfall Aviary towers in Singapore house a large collection of exotic birds but also one of the largest man-made indoor waterfalls in the world. At 35 meters tall, about 13 stories, the waterfall is arguably as impressive as the wildlife there.

""A suspension bridge in the zone allows visitors to get a panoramic view of the surrounding landscape, and a hiking trail lets the visitors catch sight of some of the more reticent birds in action. Birds housed in the aviary include various species of African glossy starlings, turacos, and the White-necked rockfowl,"" according to Wikipedia.

5. Canonteign Falls in England is another impressive man-made waterfall

This 70-meter man-made waterfall was created in 1890 by diverting a stream over a natural cliff. It is officially one of the highest waterfalls in England and one of the world's tallest man-made ones too.

Called the Lady Exmouth Falls, they were named in honor of the 3rd Lady Exmouth and were built under her direction in the late 1800s.

""An impressive feat of engineering, the Lady Exmouth Falls were created by local miners under the direction of Lady Susan Exmouth after they had been made redundant following the closure of the estate's silver mines.

95,"Beyond the brink: A look at recent animal extinctions

Photo illustration

For better or worse, Homo sapiens have left their mark on the world. So much so that those in charge of our history are considering replacing Holocene—the label for our current geological period spanning the past 10,000 years—with Anthropocene, a term to describe a period where human activity has dominated the climate and environment on Earth.

Percentage of assessed species threatened with extinction • Amphibians: 40% • Mammals: 25% • Conifers: 34% • Birds: 14% • Sharks and rays: 31% • Reef corals: 33% • Selected crustaceans: 27%

Why is the distinction significant? Scientists believe we are now in the middle of the sixth mass extinction, this one triggered primarily by human activity. The race is on to discover and catalog all the world’s living organisms before it’s too late. Here’s a look at just a few of the animals we’ve lost in recent history.

International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List

Formed in 1948, the International Union for Conservation of Nature is a network of organizations and experts devoted to good global stewardship. Part of its mission includes managing the Red List, a catalog of species threatened with extinction. Established in 1964, the list divides species into nine categories: not evaluated, data deficient, least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild and extinct.

According to the Red List, scientists have assessed more than 96,900 species. Of these, more than 26,500 are considered potential candidates for extinction.

Nevada species spotlight

Dixie Valley toad (Bufo williamsi)

Quick List • Yuma clapper rail (Rallus longirostris yumanensis) • Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) • Southwestern willow flycatcher (Empidonax traillii extimus) • Tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor) • Cui-ui fish (Chasmistes cujus) • Carson wandering skipper (Pseudocopaeodes eunus obscurus)

In June, the Las Vegas Sun reported that U.S. wildlife officials agreed to consider protection for the Dixie Valley toad, a rare toad in Northern Nevada’s high desert. Featuring flecks of gold on its olive-colored skin, the 2-inch-long toad was discovered in 2007 in the thick underbrush of a spring-fed marsh in the Dixie Valley, where an ancient lake once covered 190,000 square miles.

One of the smallest “true toads,” the Dixie is found in an area covering fewer than 3 square miles in the marshy remnant of the lake bed east of Reno and is regularly threatened by development.

The Dixie Valley toad is also under threat from other factors including disease, predation from the non-native American bullfrog, habitat loss due to climate change and livestock grazing, etc.

Ways you can help

According to the National Wildlife Federation, up to one-third of U.S. species are at increased risk of extinction, and more than 1,300 U.S. plants and animals already have been federally listed as threatened or endangered and are protected under the Endangered Species Act. So how can you help?

Extinction is a problem we can’t simply fix by “saving the species” and keeping them in zoos. A captive population does not help maintain a fragile wild ecosystem. The hard truth is, once a species has made it high enough on the IUCN Red List, it will likely never recover.

So while it may be too late for some species, conservation is still a worthwhile effort to help others survive the delicate webs of a rapidly changing natural world.

1. Educate yourself, family and friends about endangered species in the area.

2. Donate to or volunteer with organizations such as the National Wildlife Federation or local agencies.

3. Make an effort to be zero waste by purchasing sustainable products, recycling, using less water and reducing your carbon footprint. Demand the same of corporations.

4. Put pressure on local politicians and organizations to defend natural spaces and support conservation policies.

5. Grow native plants to attract native species of insects, birds and other animals that bolster the ecosystem.

Extinct in the 21st century: World species spotlight

Quick list • Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) 2000 • Baiji, Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) 2007 • Spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) 2008 • Eastern cougar (Puma concolor couguar) 2011 • Japanese river otter (Lutra lutra whiteleyi) 2012 • Formosan clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa brachyura) 2013

Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii): 2012

Able to survive up to six months without food or water, Galápagos Islands tortoises were no match for humans. Settlers hunted the giant reptiles for meat and shell trophies, and grazing goats destroyed their habitat. The last of one subspecies was discovered in 1971, living all alone on Pinta Island. Scientists made efforts to mate the tortoise with other similar species, but to no avail. Lonesome George died June 24, 2012, at Galápagos National Park.

Spix’s macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii): 2000

Although not technically confirmed yet by the IUCN, the Spix’s macaw is considered possibly extinct in the wild because of habitat loss, capture, invasive threats, etc. According to the IUCN, although this species exists in several captive populations, the last known individual in the wild disappeared at the end of 2000. Any remaining population is likely to be too tiny to effectively repopulate. A native of Brazil, the species’ troubles were fictionalized in the film Rio, where Blu, the last captive male Spix’s macaw, must win over the heart of Jewel, the last wild female.

West African black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis longipes): 2011

This black rhinoceros subspecies numbered fewer than 10 by 2001 and was located in the forests of war-ravaged northern Cameroon. Once all over central Africa, the population fell because of poaching for its horn. After it hadn't been seen in more than a decade, the IUCN listed the rhino as extinct in 2011. No West African black rhinos are known in captivity.

Extinct in the 20th century: World species spotlight

Quick List • California grizzly (Ursus arctos californicus) 1922 • Thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) 1936 • Bali tiger (Panthera tigris balica) 1937 • Pig-footed bandicoot (Chaeropus ecaudatus) 1950s • Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) 1950s • Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) 1960s • Javan tiger (Panthera tigris sondaica) 1980s

Passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius): 1914

Found throughout North America and once so numerous their flocks blocked out the sun, the passenger pigeon was driven to extinction in a short span of 100 years. Because of the destruction the voracious migratory birds wrought on crops and trees (the sheer weight of their number when perching could break branches) communities hosted mass pigeon shoots to cull themâ€”plus their feathers looked good in hats. Then, when their remaining numbers were at a critical threshold, a deadly virus hit. With too few animals left to reproduce, the bird disappeared.

Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinenis): 1918

Similar is the story of the Carolina parakeet of the southeastern United States. Within the span of 100 years, the population of Carolina parakeets fell from several million to nothing, thanks in part to their eating things humans also like to eat, such as crops and orchard fruits. Highly social birds, they never left a fallen bird behind, which made them easy targets.

Quick list • Pyrenean ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) 2000 • Baiji, Yangtze River dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer) 2007 • Spotted green pigeon (Caloenas maculata) 2008 • Eastern cougar (Puma concolor couguar) 2011 • Japanese river otter (Lutra lutra whiteleyi) 2012 • Formosan clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa brachyura) 2013

Pinta Island tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii): 2012

Able to survive up to six months without food or water, Galápagos Islands tortoises were no match for humans. Settlers hunted the giant reptiles for meat and shell trophies, and grazing goats destroyed their habitat. The last of one subspecies was discovered in 1971, living all alone on Pinta Island. Scientists made efforts to mate the tortoise with other similar species, but to no avail. Lonesome George died June 24, 2012, at Galápagos National Park.

Spix’s macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii): 2000

Although not technically confirmed yet by the IUCN, the Spix’s macaw is considered possibly extinct in the wild because of habitat loss, capture, invasive threats, etc. According to the IUCN, although this species exists in several captive populations, the last known individual in the wild disappeared at the end of 2000. Any remaining population is likely to be too tiny to effectively repopulate. A native of Brazil, the species’ troubles were fictionalized in the film Rio, where Blu, the last captive male Spix’s macaw, must win over the heart of Jewel, the last wild female.

West African black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis longipes): 2011

This black rhinoceros subspecies numbered fewer than 10 by 2001 and was located in the forests of war-ravaged northern Cameroon. Once all over central Africa, the population fell because of poaching for its horn. After it hadn't been seen in more than a decade, the IUCN listed the rhino as extinct in 2011. No West African black rhinos are known in captivity.

Extinct in the 20th century: World species spotlight

Quick List • California grizzly (Ursus arctos californicus) 1922 • Thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) 1936 • Bali tiger (Panthera tigris balica) 1937 • Pig-footed bandicoot (Chaeropus ecaudatus) 1950s • Caspian tiger (Panthera tigris tigris) 1950s • Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) 1960s • Javan tiger (Panthera tigris sondaica) 1980s

Passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius): 1914

Found throughout North America and once so numerous their flocks blocked out the sun, the passenger pigeon was driven to extinction in a short span of 100 years. Because of the destruction the voracious migratory birds wrought on crops and trees (the sheer weight of their number when perching could break branches) communities hosted mass pigeon shoots to cull themâ€”plus their feathers looked good in hats. Then, when their remaining numbers were at a critical threshold, a deadly virus hit. With too few animals left to reproduce, the bird disappeared.

Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinenis): 1918

Similar is the story of the Carolina parakeet of the southeastern United States. Within the span of 100 years, the population of Carolina parakeets fell from several million to nothing, thanks in part to their eating things humans also like to eat, such as crops and orchard fruits. Highly social birds, they never left a fallen bird behind, which made them easy targets.

It looks like the result of an ill-fated breeding ­experiment involving an old feather duster and a supermarket chicken.

But this bald parrot has been introduced to another similar bird at Edinburgh Zoo to help save their species from ­extinction.

The red-fronted macaws, which are critically endangered in their native Bolivia, were rescued in customs seizures.

They were so stressed that they had plucked their own plumage and now struggle to fly.

While the female has an ­altogether bare chest and ­shoulders, the male has also removed vital flight feathers.

After being cared for in separate European zoos, neither has ­successfully bred in captivity.

But keepers at Edinburgh Zoo hope that by introducing the pair for the first time, they may bond.

With only a few hundred left, the species is in danger of ­disappearing from the wild and any offspring could play a vital role in its future.

Edinburgh Zoo’s animal ­collection manager Jo Elliot, who co-ordinates the European breeding programme for the species, said: “The red-fronted macaw is disappearing very rapidly.

“Just a few hundred are left in the wild in Bolivia.

“These two are older birds, which have never bred in captivity – so they’re really important genetically.

“We’ve brought them together and put them in a big, happy ­enclosure to give them a chance at breeding and reproducing.”

Jo said that feather plucking was a rare stress response among ­red-fronted macaws but can become habit-forming and ­continue even when the birds are happily settled.

If done repeatedly, feathers do not grow back and could prevent the birds from flying.

She added: “We don’t believe these birds are plucking actively any more but they’re scarred and they may not regrow feathers in those areas.” Red-fronted macaws are difficult to breed in captivity and it is not known whether the birds were shunned by their ­feathered counterparts because they lacked plumage.

But Jo said: “Parrots are very brightly coloured and they do use it as a means of social ­communication but how ­important that is for breeding we’re not really sure.

“These ones have been paired up before but, for whatever ­reason, they’ve never bred.

(Image: Saltire News)

“They’re now near the end of their breeding lifespan so this is their last chance. It’d be ­brilliant if they bred together.”

Red-fronted macaws measure up to 60cm in length.

Native only to a small region in Bolivia, the colourful species is persecuted as a crop pest.

Although there are efforts to conserve them in their native habitat, around 150 birds in the European breeding programme co-ordinated from Edinburgh currently form a back-up ­“insurance population”.

Jo added: “We had a lot of ­discussions about whether we should take these two on because they do have an odd appearance.

“We were concerned that people would look at them and think, ‘Oh my goodness, what have they done to those birds’, but we were more concerned in the end that they have the best possible ­opportunities for good welfare and the possibility of breeding.”",Edinburgh Zoo puts stressed-out rare birds together in bid to beat extinction,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiECeDZ9t5bvLqrzB6E4xea4cqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowrueiCTDmn7gCMIbTtwU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article19000003.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Bald-RedFrontedMacaws_SA_10JPG.jpg,2019-08-25,"{'sent': 'Sign up to FREE email alerts from Daily Record - daily Subscribe Thank you for subscribing', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Subscribe']}}","Sign up to FREE email alerts from Daily Record - daily Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email

101,"Our intrepid colleague and photographer Fabio went in search of the adorable snub nosed monkeys in Baima Snow Mountain National Park (白马雪山).

Ten facts about black snub-nosed monkeys

The species of primates was first discovered by scientists in the 1890s. Subsequently they weren't seen again, and thought to be extinct until 1962.

The Black Snub-Nosed Monkey was almost completely unknown by the scientific community until the 1990s.

They make their home at altitudes higher than any other primate except humans and can survive at altitudes up to 4700 meters.

The Black Snub-Nosed Monkey lives in very large super-groups which are made up of several families. Each of them has a single dominant male with many females.

Their favorite food is the Spanish moss that grows abundantly in the remote forests of South China but it takes a lot to regrow, forcing the monkeys to move fast and look for new sources of food.

The Black Snub-Nosed Monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti – 黑金丝猴), native of Yunnan, are not the same as the Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys (Rhinopithecus roxellana – 川金丝猴) that are native of Sichuan.

The Black Snub-Nosed Monkeys left in the wild are about 3000 while the Golden Snub-Nosed Monkeys range from 8,000 to 15,000. The Tonkin Snub-Nosed Monkey is yet another species that lives in northern Vietnam.

When it rains they sneeze quite often, due to their particular nose.

They give birth about once every two or three years.

The biggest threats for this species are habitat loss (due to the illegal logging and removal of dead trees) and illegal hunting.

See the monkeys for yourselves

If you want to see the Black Snub-Nosed Monkey in the wild it's possible to do so.

You can take a bus from Lijiang to Tacheng (4 hours) and stay at guesthouse or hotel. In the morning you can see the monkeys, when the rangers feed them. It is not yet very developed as a tourist destination and no English is spoken.

Alternatively you can book a tour with a local tour operator.

102,"Local hunting and illegal wildlife trade have decimated wildlife populations in forests throughout the tropics, and often, vulnerable species have been extirpated.

While evidence of human-driven animal extinctions date back to 125,000 years ago in Africa, the earliest records of human-driven extinctions in Asia date back to 40,000 years ago.

Compared to other Asian countries, India has strong wildlife protection laws, but wildlife law enforcement varies depending on the region, protected area and the legal status of the forest in question.

In this part-review, part-commentary, scientists Aparajita Datta and Rohit Naniwadekar from the Nature Conservation Foundation discuss their observations from working extensively in northeast India: the different socio-cultural aspects of hunting, the depth of indigenous knowledge and the importance of involving local communities in conservation.

Hunting poses a significant risk to wildlife persistence in four-fifths of the remaining tropical forests on earth. Eighty percent of these tropical forests lie within a 20-km radius of a human settlement, which is often the average distance a hunter would traverse to hunt. Local hunting and illegal wildlife trade can result in local extirpations and drive species to extinction. Wildlife populations have declined in forests throughout the tropics due to hunting, and often, vulnerable species have been extirpated, resulting in what is called the ‘empty forest syndrome’. These are forests that are structurally intact but functionally defunct. Such forests are more silent, there are fewer calls, few animal signs and tracks, one may also find undispersed fruits and seeds below tree canopies.

Many of the species targeted for hunting play important ecological roles in the ecosystem as carnivores, herbivores and seed dispersers. The extinctions are often size-biased as larger animals are more vulnerable to hunting. Loss of large vertebrates in the tropics, many of which are herbivores and seed dispersers, can have cascading impacts on plant communities.

Hunting in Asia

While evidence of human-driven animal extinctions date back to 125,000 years ago in Africa, the earliest records of human-driven extinctions in Asia date back to 40,000 years ago. It was probably around then that the slow-moving Giant Pangolin Manis paleojavanica was driven extinct by humans. Apart from the hunting of large vertebrates, like deer, pigs and bovids (the cow family, like the Indian gaur), from records dating back to 45,000 years, studies have documented human hunting of primates, civets, rodents, pythons, and monitor lizards, highlighting pervasive, historical hunting.

Diverse methods, including the use of dogs, bow & arrow, traps, and smoking of fossorial mammals are traditionally used for hunting. The use of guns for hunting is a more recent phenomenon. Apart from hunting for meat, collection of animal body parts has been of interest to humans for the last two thousand years. Many animal body parts are used in traditional costumes and ceremonies of different South-east Asian communities.

While hunting has been extensively studied in the Americas and Africa, information is relatively limited from Asia and is mostly restricted to illegal wildlife trade. A 2018 study identified hunting as the main immediate threat for Asia’s endangered vertebrates and indicated that animal populations had declined considerably since the eighties with many species extirpated from parts of former ranges. They contended that overhunting due to improved forest access, hunting technology, markets and higher demand for wild meat, medicinal products, pets, and of high-value species was unsustainable and law enforcement is weak.

Hunting in north-east India

Compared to other Asian countries, India has strong wildlife protection laws, but wildlife law enforcement varies depending on the region, protected area and the legal status of the forest in question. Enforcement in the hilly northeastern states has been mostly limited. North-east India is geographically and culturally similar to South-east Asia, where wildlife hunting for consumption and trade is extensive and more open. However, local hunting is prevalent in other parts of India as well; researchers have documented both in southern India and Western Himalaya. Anecdotal and media reports suggest intensive hunting also occurs in parts of eastern and central India.

The north-eastern region is known for its biological richness with two biodiversity hotspots – Indo-Myanmar and the Himalaya, and has a relatively low human population density. While it comprises only 8 percent of the country’s area, it makes up a fourth of India’s forest cover. Forest cover in most north-eastern states is between 50 to 90 percent. These states harbour important biodiversity, with high species richness within faunal groups (nine wild cat species, 21 small carnivore species, 13 large herbivore/ungulate species, 12 primate species). Namdapha National Park, for instance, has 140 mammal and over 400 bird species, apart from the smaller vertebrate and invertebrates still being documented.

North-east India is India’s biological frontier with exploration surveys leading to description of many new species. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, it is a region, barring the state of Assam, where wildlife hunting is pervasive. The region shares international borders with Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh, China and Bhutan, which are along forested mountain ridges posing challenges to controlling cross-border wildlife trade.

Apart from biodiversity, the cultural and linguistic diversity is also tremendous. More than 220 ethnic groups reside here. Hunting has strong cultural roots in north-east India. Many tribal communities in north-east India have dedicated annual hunting festivals. However, often they also have strong taboos on hunting with respect to season and animal species. Species that are reported as taboo include the elephant, hoolock gibbon and other primates, Himalayan serow, tiger (often wild cats in general), hornbills, and squirrels, but this varies within and between communities.

Taboos can also break down depending on context such as when animals crop-raid or kill livestock; or due to generational change, change in religion or advent of migrants/outsiders. The Mishmis and several other communities have elaborate rituals that are performed after most hunting trips. In most areas, hunting hornbills during their breeding season is avoided. It is believed that such a trespass would incur the curse of the incarcerated female and chick, which are dependent on the male for food.

Studies assessing hunting impacts on animals and ecosystems have picked up in the last decade. However, considering the scale of hunting in north-east India, it has been relatively less-studied. Hunted animals vary in body size from giant wood spiders to elephants. Several studies have recorded numbers of species hunted: 134 species (mammals, birds and reptiles) from Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, 23 mammal species in western Arunachal Pradesh, 33 mammal species in 3 different sites in Arunachal Pradesh, 43 mammal species hunted in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.

In a market survey, 35 bird species were recorded being sold in Nagaland. Given that even smaller birds (sunbirds, warblers) are often hunted and consumed, these numbers are an underestimate. While molluscs and amphibians are primarily hunted in the monsoon, the main hunting season for large vertebrates is winter when people are free from farming activities.

The motivations for hunting vary from local meat consumption, hunting for body parts of animals (e.g. Great Hornbills Buceros bicornis for its casque or tail feathers worn as part of traditional attire), for illegal wildlife trade (elephants and rhinoceros for their ivory and horn respectively), retaliatory killing of crop-raiding animals (e.g. wild pigs Sus scrofa), medicinal value of body parts, for cash to meet basic needs or as recreation.

Impacts of hunting

Although there is limited quantified data, hunting can have significant impacts on wildlife abundance and persistence in the region. Most studies have mainly documented numbers of species hunted and details of practices and patterns. Local people along the Indo-Myanmar border confirmed the presence of the Sumatran Rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis in the recent past, which have become extinct from the region. In Nagaland, a skull of the Sumatran Rhinoceros, hunted decades ago, was seen, highlighting that hunting pressures can drive large-bodied species to local extinction. During the ethnic conflict around Manas Tiger Reserve in the 1990s, one-horned rhinoceros were hunted out.

Clear impacts have been shown for some species such as reduction in hornbill encounter rates/densities between protected areas and less-protected Reserved forests although these comparisons are confounded by the occurrence of logging in the more hunted sites. Possible local extirpations of hornbills have been documented from good forested habitats in Arunachal and across other states in North-east India. Studies comparing large mammal abundances between protected areas and community-managed lands have also shown that large mammals fare better in protected areas, while abundances of large mammals can be poor even in protected areas or vary between protected areas depending on the protection efforts.

In northern Myanmar, a 2005 study showed that hunting was indiscriminate and based on relative abundance of species rather than preference or protection status. Encounter rates for hunted species were inversely related to proximity to human habitation. Wild meat consumption was higher in winter months and barking deer, primates and wild pigs were the top three consumed species.

Trade in bear body parts is high in Arunachal Pradesh with a survey recording 701 body parts from 99 individual bears of two bear species. Such offtake levels are likely to affect populations. A 2010 study reported a decline in Orange-bellied squirrel due to hunting for medicinal use.

Two important groups targeted by hunting are herbivores and seed dispersers, both of which play an important role in governing plant community structure in tropical forests. Loss of seed dispersers has been demonstrated to negatively impact regeneration of fleshy-fruited plants dependent on them for seed dispersal. This results in shifts in plant communities from predominantly animal-dispersed plant species to abiotically dispersed plant species. The impacts and role of reduced herbivory on plant communities is little understood in India.

However, the narrative and evidence may be different in certain areas for some species.

A 2018 study describes the long-distance annual winter hunts for the takin (Budorcas taxicolor) that the Adis undertake in the context of their relationship with spirits and the natural world. This hunt is physically and mentally challenging and has a special significance in the community. Each village has designated different areas where they can hunt takin in their community-managed forests. The system ensures that it is not a free-for-all. A certain number is hunted annually. The impacts of these offtakes on takin populations have not been quantified. Notwithstanding the moral considerations that conservationists/outsiders may have to the takin hunting (which is a threatened protected species), this example needs to be better understood for a more evidence-based understanding of hunting impacts. The study also points to the changes in this activity due to increased road access and external factors.

Currently, much evidence on impacts of hunting remains anecdotal and subjective, depending on the perspective of the observer. The ubiquitous display of animal trophies among tribal communities often results in a misleading idea of hunting extent and impact. But these trophies are usually obtained over a long period. Second, many hunted individuals and smaller species are thrown away and not kept for display.

While local people in the north-east tend to prefer the taste of wild meat, it is a misconception that meat-eating is a daily affair. Daily meals consist of rice and local vegetables and sometimes fish. Wild meat is eaten on rare occasions. Most meals were of vegetables (60%) with wild meat consumed in only 9% of meals in local households in northern Myanmar, found a 2005 study. Domestic livestock is reared, but is not used for regular consumption, and usually kept for festivals, weddings or for sale.

Knowledge gaps

The existing studies have focussed on the larger vertebrate groups, yet most have only documented the number of species hunted and other parameters of hunting patterns and practices with no quantification of off-take of targeted species and the impacts on abundance of target species. A few studies have shown differences in densities between hunted and better protected sites. However, there is a need to study off-take rates of different animal groups and its consequent impacts on wild animal populations. This is a drawback of studies on hunting in India where offtake rates have not been estimated (numbers and biomass hunted over a given area in a time period). This is unlike studies in South America/Africa where offtake rates have been quantified by following hunters on their hunting trips.

In India, hunting is illegal in most areas and is a difficult subject to study due to legal and ethical factors. Even fewer studies have undertaken assessments of hunting of small birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. Turtles, tortoises and species like the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) are likely to be extremely vulnerable due to offtake for the illegal wildlife trade. In 2006, we heard of collections of beetles/butterflies in a locality in Arunachal being undertaken to sell to museums. Local people were being given Rs. 10 by external agents for every beetle they collected.

It is equally important to conduct ethnographical studies to document the diversity of hunting techniques, rituals, taboos and other cultural aspects associated with hunting and determine the temporal changes and their impacts with the advent of advanced technology, improved access, and cultural changes (e.g. religious conversion). It would also be useful to understand how the transition in people’s lifestyles, shift to an urban and market economy, and education have changed hunting intensity and patterns. It would be important to understand the changes in demand/supply dynamics, the key drivers and institutional and local systems of governance to stop or regulate hunting. Some insights have emerged from a few interdisciplinary studies, however, much more is needed.

The debate over hunting, its impacts and how to address it

Hunting is illegal in most of India and is usually referred to as poaching. Given the moral, and ethical value judgements against hunting by people from most of the rest of India, any hunting, whether it is subsistence or commercial, or whether it has real negative impacts is considered undesirable by many wildlife conservationists/forest authorities.

There is concern over the wide range of targeted species and the high hunting intensity. People argue that hunting and consumption of wild meat is increasingly indefensible and unsustainable. Under this view, it is advocated that hunting must be stopped through recourse to the law and enforcement.

However, there are several other aspects to local hunting. First, we need to understand that many communities have a utilitarian worldview of nature. There is a relationship with nature, observations are made and knowledge is gained from proximity to nature. At the same time, nature is viewed as a resource to be used or consumed. Notwithstanding the concern for depleting wildlife, some reflection is warranted before imposition of value-judgements on people who have their own. It is important to understand the socio-economic contexts under which different levels of hunting occur and the external drivers.

Second comes cultural history. If national wildlife laws are not in consonance with local societal values and customs – there will be a lag and it will take time for people to change. Prior to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1971, hunting was acceptable in other parts of India. Several hunters from the princely class later became passionate conservationists. It was even fashionable to hunt in the fifties and sixties. Many practices and customs take time to change as the society’s values and the contexts change. Hunting cannot be always stopped suddenly. Enforcement is not the only way to reduce hunting, given the deep-rooted and often historical socio-cultural factors involved. It is challenging to convince people to give up an important part of their way of life.

Hunting for commercial trade (musk deer, tiger, elephant, bears, pangolins and the Tokay gecko) is a serious issue. However, this targeted hunting is usually limited to fewer people in each community/site. It is often difficult to distinguish between “subsistence” and commercial hunting. People who are not regular hunters may go trapping for otters, musk deer, and bears to get cash for ‘subsistence’ living (basic needs or medical treatment). As the health facilities are often inadequate, private hospitals are preferred. For example, one man needed Rs. 12,000 for an appendix surgery for his son. So, an otter was killed.

While hunting is against the law, even government officials and politicians hunt or seek to buy wild meat and use animal products. Paradoxically, sometimes they do not officially acknowledge that hunting is a problem and are uncomfortable with discussions on the subject, even though privately they acknowledge it as an important issue.

How is hunting being addressed

Illegal wildlife trade for species like the tiger, elephant, rhino has been controlled in certain Protected Areas using strict patrolling and even armed enforcement by the Forest Department. In and around the Pakke Tiger Reserve, the Nyishi community, forest department and scientists/researchers are working together, to strengthen wildlife conservation. Local institutions have banned hunting and instituted fines. This would have been unheard of earlier when hunting was socially more acceptable. The wildlife laws existed– but the awareness and the societal acceptance of the law was minimal. The changes took time and only law enforcement by the Forest Department would not have helped in bringing about this change.

There are other initiatives across north-east India that have resulted in control of hunting though there is no quantitative data to show the results of such initiatives. Some of these are self-driven by the communities with or without the support of conservationists and organizations and/or state institutions, while others have been driven by external organizations and state institutions. In Nagaland, many Community-Conserved Areas have been declared through community institutions with some being strengthened by external organizations.

Villagers in Khonoma, Nagaland enforce hunting regulations, which has resulted in persistence of tragopans and other wildlife. However, in general, the efficacy of these community-imposed hunting bans in terms of wildlife population recovery has not been assessed. In places like the Ziro valley, the Apatani community through strong community organizations (like Ngunu Ziro) are making efforts to retain their cultural and natural heritage. A 2010 study reported on the decline of the Orange-bellied squirrel due to hunting but also how this led to hunting restrictions through the traditional village council. There are more examples of hunting bans imposed by villages in community lands in Arunachal: by the Berung, the Adi community and in Arunachal Pradesh.

The local Forest Department authorities along with conservationists have worked with the Bugun community to declare part of their forests as the Sinchung Bugun Village Community Reserve. Prior to reserve declaration, studies indicated declines of large mammals (tiger, otters and gaur) had occurred due to hunting, however these community-managed lands harboured smaller species of conservation importance.

The mass killing of Amur falcons in Nagaland was highlighted by conservationists and immediate action helped to stop the slaughter – but the co-operation of the Forest Department, local communities, and different Non-Governmental Organizations was needed to change the ground situation. However, most hunting (barring the annual hunting festivals in some areas) is not of this scale – it is low-intensity and by fewer people.

Recent studies have tried to understand hunting from an anthropological/socio-cultural perspective and understanding human-animal relationships such as among the Miju Mishmi, Adi and Idu Mishmi. Their work has uncovered relationships that these communities have with nature and their view of wild animals, hunting practices and patterns, their dynamic regulatory practices and customary laws for hunting which provides a nuanced and inter-disciplinary understanding which has lessons that can be of value in addressing the contentious issue of hunting. Their work has underlined the value of local institutions that can play an important role in controlling hunting and the need for forest authorities and conservationists to engage with these institutions.

Aiyadurai (2018) says: “If the conservation groups take note of local people’s perceptions of animals, there could be a way forward to better and locally acceptable ways of conservation and that are likely to be more sustainable”. However, the role of these customary institutions is steadily being diluted through changes that are currently underway in Arunachal.

In most contexts, given other pressures on wildlife, hunting needs to be reduced or stopped. However, it is not always about law enforcement only and it requires a nuanced understanding and sensitivity. The few community-based conservation initiatives are important, but islands in terms of the bigger picture. There is a need to scale these efforts based on a more holistic inter-disciplinary understanding of hunting and ways to address it through engagement and dialogue with people. An interesting study by young Naga students suggests that education and awareness is important and a regional policy that takes into consideration conservation needs and local values/practices.

Most communities in the north-east are largely agriculturalists. Despite the changes, the extent of urbanization and development continues to remain much less than other parts of India, due to the geographical isolation and relative inaccessibility. However, there is an increasing rural and urban divide. Government policies often seek to wean people away from the forest. This may end up severing the relationships that people have had with nature.

Often, the best naturalists and observers of wildlife are the hunters. Sometimes hunting surveys have resulted in finding species that were not known to be present in the region. Several such ‘discoveries’ are often due to the natural history knowledge of hunters. They often tend to have more empathy and understanding. Unless we engage with them, we lose something of value.

We have worked with several remarkable tribal people who, once they had undergone a change of heart, became strong advocates for wildlife protection. It is important not to cut off dialogue with hunters who in many instances have become protectors and advocates for wildlife. By working with individuals from different communities we have come to understand to some extent, the individual motivations of hunters. Engaging with individuals directly and with their local institutions and customary laws maybe a more effective albeit difficult and slow strategy to bring about changes.

It is important that people continue to retain past connections with nature because unless people value that – it has fewer chances of remaining. Several examples of local initiatives are emerging and bring hope for conservation, not only because it helps wildlife but also because many people now appear to have a different relationship with nature out of concern, empathy, curiosity, and local pride. Many younger people are now engaged with ‘hunting’ and observing wildlife (including birds, butterflies and moths) with cameras and binoculars and taking pride in their natural heritage.

Compared to other Asian countries, India has strong wildlife protection laws, but wildlife law enforcement varies depending on the region, protected area and the legal status of the forest in question.

In this part-review, part-commentary, scientists Aparajita Datta and Rohit Naniwadekar from the Nature Conservation Foundation discuss their observations from working extensively in northeast India: the different socio-cultural aspects of hunting, the depth of indigenous knowledge and the importance of involving local communities in conservation.

Hunting poses a significant risk to wildlife persistence in four-fifths of the remaining tropical forests on earth. Eighty percent of these tropical forests lie within a 20-km radius of a human settlement, which is often the average distance a hunter would traverse to hunt. Local hunting and illegal wildlife trade can result in local extirpations and drive species to extinction. Wildlife populations have declined in forests throughout the tropics due to hunting, and often, vulnerable species have been extirpated, resulting in what is called the ‘empty forest syndrome’. These are forests that are structurally intact but functionally defunct. Such forests are more silent, there are fewer calls, few animal signs and tracks, one may also find undispersed fruits and seeds below tree canopies.

Many of the species targeted for hunting play important ecological roles in the ecosystem as carnivores, herbivores and seed dispersers. The extinctions are often size-biased as larger animals are more vulnerable to hunting. Loss of large vertebrates in the tropics, many of which are herbivores and seed dispersers, can have cascading impacts on plant communities.

Hunting in Asia

While evidence of human-driven animal extinctions date back to 125,000 years ago in Africa, the earliest records of human-driven extinctions in Asia date back to 40,000 years ago. It was probably around then that the slow-moving Giant Pangolin Manis paleojavanica was driven extinct by humans. Apart from the hunting of large vertebrates, like deer, pigs and bovids (the cow family, like the Indian gaur), from records dating back to 45,000 years, studies have documented human hunting of primates, civets, rodents, pythons, and monitor lizards, highlighting pervasive, historical hunting.

Diverse methods, including the use of dogs, bow & arrow, traps, and smoking of fossorial mammals are traditionally used for hunting. The use of guns for hunting is a more recent phenomenon. Apart from hunting for meat, collection of animal body parts has been of interest to humans for the last two thousand years. Many animal body parts are used in traditional costumes and ceremonies of different South-east Asian communities.

While hunting has been extensively studied in the Americas and Africa, information is relatively limited from Asia and is mostly restricted to illegal wildlife trade. A 2018 study identified hunting as the main immediate threat for Asia’s endangered vertebrates and indicated that animal populations had declined considerably since the eighties with many species extirpated from parts of former ranges. They contended that overhunting due to improved forest access, hunting technology, markets and higher demand for wild meat, medicinal products, pets, and of high-value species was unsustainable and law enforcement is weak.

Hunting in north-east India

Compared to other Asian countries, India has strong wildlife protection laws, but wildlife law enforcement varies depending on the region, protected area and the legal status of the forest in question. Enforcement in the hilly northeastern states has been mostly limited. North-east India is geographically and culturally similar to South-east Asia, where wildlife hunting for consumption and trade is extensive and more open. However, local hunting is prevalent in other parts of India as well; researchers have documented both in southern India and Western Himalaya. Anecdotal and media reports suggest intensive hunting also occurs in parts of eastern and central India.

The north-eastern region is known for its biological richness with two biodiversity hotspots – Indo-Myanmar and the Himalaya, and has a relatively low human population density. While it comprises only 8 percent of the country’s area, it makes up a fourth of India’s forest cover. Forest cover in most north-eastern states is between 50 to 90 percent. These states harbour important biodiversity, with high species richness within faunal groups (nine wild cat species, 21 small carnivore species, 13 large herbivore/ungulate species, 12 primate species). Namdapha National Park, for instance, has 140 mammal and over 400 bird species, apart from the smaller vertebrate and invertebrates still being documented.

North-east India is India’s biological frontier with exploration surveys leading to description of many new species. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, it is a region, barring the state of Assam, where wildlife hunting is pervasive. The region shares international borders with Myanmar, Nepal, Bangladesh, China and Bhutan, which are along forested mountain ridges posing challenges to controlling cross-border wildlife trade.

Apart from biodiversity, the cultural and linguistic diversity is also tremendous. More than 220 ethnic groups reside here. Hunting has strong cultural roots in north-east India. Many tribal communities in north-east India have dedicated annual hunting festivals. However, often they also have strong taboos on hunting with respect to season and animal species. Species that are reported as taboo include the elephant, hoolock gibbon and other primates, Himalayan serow, tiger (often wild cats in general), hornbills, and squirrels, but this varies within and between communities.

Taboos can also break down depending on context such as when animals crop-raid or kill livestock; or due to generational change, change in religion or advent of migrants/outsiders. The Mishmis and several other communities have elaborate rituals that are performed after most hunting trips. In most areas, hunting hornbills during their breeding season is avoided. It is believed that such a trespass would incur the curse of the incarcerated female and chick, which are dependent on the male for food.

Studies assessing hunting impacts on animals and ecosystems have picked up in the last decade. However, considering the scale of hunting in north-east India, it has been relatively less-studied. Hunted animals vary in body size from giant wood spiders to elephants. Several studies have recorded numbers of species hunted: 134 species (mammals, birds and reptiles) from Nagaland, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh, 23 mammal species in western Arunachal Pradesh, 33 mammal species in 3 different sites in Arunachal Pradesh, 43 mammal species hunted in Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.

In a market survey, 35 bird species were recorded being sold in Nagaland. Given that even smaller birds (sunbirds, warblers) are often hunted and consumed, these numbers are an underestimate. While molluscs and amphibians are primarily hunted in the monsoon, the main hunting season for large vertebrates is winter when people are free from farming activities.

The motivations for hunting vary from local meat consumption, hunting for body parts of animals (e.g. Great Hornbills Buceros bicornis for its casque or tail feathers worn as part of traditional attire), for illegal wildlife trade (elephants and rhinoceros for their ivory and horn respectively), retaliatory killing of crop-raiding animals (e.g. wild pigs Sus scrofa), medicinal value of body parts, for cash to meet basic needs or as recreation.

Impacts of hunting

Although there is limited quantified data, hunting can have significant impacts on wildlife abundance and persistence in the region. Most studies have mainly documented numbers of species hunted and details of practices and patterns. Local people along the Indo-Myanmar border confirmed the presence of the Sumatran Rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis in the recent past, which have become extinct from the region. In Nagaland, a skull of the Sumatran Rhinoceros, hunted decades ago, was seen, highlighting that hunting pressures can drive large-bodied species to local extinction. During the ethnic conflict around Manas Tiger Reserve in the 1990s, one-horned rhinoceros were hunted out.

Clear impacts have been shown for some species such as reduction in hornbill encounter rates/densities between protected areas and less-protected Reserved forests although these comparisons are confounded by the occurrence of logging in the more hunted sites. Possible local extirpations of hornbills have been documented from good forested habitats in Arunachal and across other states in North-east India. Studies comparing large mammal abundances between protected areas and community-managed lands have also shown that large mammals fare better in protected areas, while abundances of large mammals can be poor even in protected areas or vary between protected areas depending on the protection efforts.

In northern Myanmar, a 2005 study showed that hunting was indiscriminate and based on relative abundance of species rather than preference or protection status. Encounter rates for hunted species were inversely related to proximity to human habitation. Wild meat consumption was higher in winter months and barking deer, primates and wild pigs were the top three consumed species.

Trade in bear body parts is high in Arunachal Pradesh with a survey recording 701 body parts from 99 individual bears of two bear species. Such offtake levels are likely to affect populations. A 2010 study reported a decline in Orange-bellied squirrel due to hunting for medicinal use.

Two important groups targeted by hunting are herbivores and seed dispersers, both of which play an important role in governing plant community structure in tropical forests. Loss of seed dispersers has been demonstrated to negatively impact regeneration of fleshy-fruited plants dependent on them for seed dispersal. This results in shifts in plant communities from predominantly animal-dispersed plant species to abiotically dispersed plant species. The impacts and role of reduced herbivory on plant communities is little understood in India.

However, the narrative and evidence may be different in certain areas for some species.

A 2018 study describes the long-distance annual winter hunts for the takin (Budorcas taxicolor) that the Adis undertake in the context of their relationship with spirits and the natural world. This hunt is physically and mentally challenging and has a special significance in the community. Each village has designated different areas where they can hunt takin in their community-managed forests. The system ensures that it is not a free-for-all. A certain number is hunted annually. The impacts of these offtakes on takin populations have not been quantified. Notwithstanding the moral considerations that conservationists/outsiders may have to the takin hunting (which is a threatened protected species), this example needs to be better understood for a more evidence-based understanding of hunting impacts. The study also points to the changes in this activity due to increased road access and external factors.

Currently, much evidence on impacts of hunting remains anecdotal and subjective, depending on the perspective of the observer. The ubiquitous display of animal trophies among tribal communities often results in a misleading idea of hunting extent and impact. But these trophies are usually obtained over a long period. Second, many hunted individuals and smaller species are thrown away and not kept for display.

While local people in the north-east tend to prefer the taste of wild meat, it is a misconception that meat-eating is a daily affair. Daily meals consist of rice and local vegetables and sometimes fish. Wild meat is eaten on rare occasions. Most meals were of vegetables (60%) with wild meat consumed in only 9% of meals in local households in northern Myanmar, found a 2005 study. Domestic livestock is reared, but is not used for regular consumption, and usually kept for festivals, weddings or for sale.

Knowledge gaps

The existing studies have focussed on the larger vertebrate groups, yet most have only documented the number of species hunted and other parameters of hunting patterns and practices with no quantification of off-take of targeted species and the impacts on abundance of target species. A few studies have shown differences in densities between hunted and better protected sites. However, there is a need to study off-take rates of different animal groups and its consequent impacts on wild animal populations. This is a drawback of studies on hunting in India where offtake rates have not been estimated (numbers and biomass hunted over a given area in a time period). This is unlike studies in South America/Africa where offtake rates have been quantified by following hunters on their hunting trips.

In India, hunting is illegal in most areas and is a difficult subject to study due to legal and ethical factors. Even fewer studies have undertaken assessments of hunting of small birds, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates. Turtles, tortoises and species like the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko) are likely to be extremely vulnerable due to offtake for the illegal wildlife trade. In 2006, we heard of collections of beetles/butterflies in a locality in Arunachal being undertaken to sell to museums. Local people were being given Rs. 10 by external agents for every beetle they collected.

It is equally important to conduct ethnographical studies to document the diversity of hunting techniques, rituals, taboos and other cultural aspects associated with hunting and determine the temporal changes and their impacts with the advent of advanced technology, improved access, and cultural changes (e.g. religious conversion). It would also be useful to understand how the transition in people’s lifestyles, shift to an urban and market economy, and education have changed hunting intensity and patterns. It would be important to understand the changes in demand/supply dynamics, the key drivers and institutional and local systems of governance to stop or regulate hunting. Some insights have emerged from a few interdisciplinary studies, however, much more is needed.

The debate over hunting, its impacts and how to address it

Hunting is illegal in most of India and is usually referred to as poaching. Given the moral, and ethical value judgements against hunting by people from most of the rest of India, any hunting, whether it is subsistence or commercial, or whether it has real negative impacts is considered undesirable by many wildlife conservationists/forest authorities.

There is concern over the wide range of targeted species and the high hunting intensity. People argue that hunting and consumption of wild meat is increasingly indefensible and unsustainable. Under this view, it is advocated that hunting must be stopped through recourse to the law and enforcement.

However, there are several other aspects to local hunting. First, we need to understand that many communities have a utilitarian worldview of nature. There is a relationship with nature, observations are made and knowledge is gained from proximity to nature. At the same time, nature is viewed as a resource to be used or consumed. Notwithstanding the concern for depleting wildlife, some reflection is warranted before imposition of value-judgements on people who have their own. It is important to understand the socio-economic contexts under which different levels of hunting occur and the external drivers.

Second comes cultural history. If national wildlife laws are not in consonance with local societal values and customs – there will be a lag and it will take time for people to change. Prior to the Wildlife Protection Act of 1971, hunting was acceptable in other parts of India. Several hunters from the princely class later became passionate conservationists. It was even fashionable to hunt in the fifties and sixties. Many practices and customs take time to change as the society’s values and the contexts change. Hunting cannot be always stopped suddenly. Enforcement is not the only way to reduce hunting, given the deep-rooted and often historical socio-cultural factors involved. It is challenging to convince people to give up an important part of their way of life.

Hunting for commercial trade (musk deer, tiger, elephant, bears, pangolins and the Tokay gecko) is a serious issue. However, this targeted hunting is usually limited to fewer people in each community/site. It is often difficult to distinguish between “subsistence” and commercial hunting. People who are not regular hunters may go trapping for otters, musk deer, and bears to get cash for ‘subsistence’ living (basic needs or medical treatment). As the health facilities are often inadequate, private hospitals are preferred. For example, one man needed Rs. 12,000 for an appendix surgery for his son. So, an otter was killed.

While hunting is against the law, even government officials and politicians hunt or seek to buy wild meat and use animal products. Paradoxically, sometimes they do not officially acknowledge that hunting is a problem and are uncomfortable with discussions on the subject, even though privately they acknowledge it as an important issue.

How is hunting being addressed

Illegal wildlife trade for species like the tiger, elephant, rhino has been controlled in certain Protected Areas using strict patrolling and even armed enforcement by the Forest Department. In and around the Pakke Tiger Reserve, the Nyishi community, forest department and scientists/researchers are working together, to strengthen wildlife conservation. Local institutions have banned hunting and instituted fines. This would have been unheard of earlier when hunting was socially more acceptable. The wildlife laws existed– but the awareness and the societal acceptance of the law was minimal. The changes took time and only law enforcement by the Forest Department would not have helped in bringing about this change.

There are other initiatives across north-east India that have resulted in control of hunting though there is no quantitative data to show the results of such initiatives. Some of these are self-driven by the communities with or without the support of conservationists and organizations and/or state institutions, while others have been driven by external organizations and state institutions. In Nagaland, many Community-Conserved Areas have been declared through community institutions with some being strengthened by external organizations.

Villagers in Khonoma, Nagaland enforce hunting regulations, which has resulted in persistence of tragopans and other wildlife. However, in general, the efficacy of these community-imposed hunting bans in terms of wildlife population recovery has not been assessed. In places like the Ziro valley, the Apatani community through strong community organizations (like Ngunu Ziro) are making efforts to retain their cultural and natural heritage. A 2010 study reported on the decline of the Orange-bellied squirrel due to hunting but also how this led to hunting restrictions through the traditional village council. There are more examples of hunting bans imposed by villages in community lands in Arunachal: by the Berung, the Adi community and in Arunachal Pradesh.

The local Forest Department authorities along with conservationists have worked with the Bugun community to declare part of their forests as the Sinchung Bugun Village Community Reserve. Prior to reserve declaration, studies indicated declines of large mammals (tiger, otters and gaur) had occurred due to hunting, however these community-managed lands harboured smaller species of conservation importance.

The mass killing of Amur falcons in Nagaland was highlighted by conservationists and immediate action helped to stop the slaughter – but the co-operation of the Forest Department, local communities, and different Non-Governmental Organizations was needed to change the ground situation. However, most hunting (barring the annual hunting festivals in some areas) is not of this scale – it is low-intensity and by fewer people.

Recent studies have tried to understand hunting from an anthropological/socio-cultural perspective and understanding human-animal relationships such as among the Miju Mishmi, Adi and Idu Mishmi. Their work has uncovered relationships that these communities have with nature and their view of wild animals, hunting practices and patterns, their dynamic regulatory practices and customary laws for hunting which provides a nuanced and inter-disciplinary understanding which has lessons that can be of value in addressing the contentious issue of hunting. Their work has underlined the value of local institutions that can play an important role in controlling hunting and the need for forest authorities and conservationists to engage with these institutions.

Read Mongabay-India’s article on indigenous knowledge of the Adi community.

Aiyadurai (2018) says: “If the conservation groups take note of local people’s perceptions of animals, there could be a way forward to better and locally acceptable ways of conservation and that are likely to be more sustainable”. However, the role of these customary institutions is steadily being diluted through changes that are currently underway in Arunachal.

In most contexts, given other pressures on wildlife, hunting needs to be reduced or stopped. However, it is not always about law enforcement only and it requires a nuanced understanding and sensitivity. The few community-based conservation initiatives are important, but islands in terms of the bigger picture. There is a need to scale these efforts based on a more holistic inter-disciplinary understanding of hunting and ways to address it through engagement and dialogue with people. An interesting study by young Naga students suggests that education and awareness is important and a regional policy that takes into consideration conservation needs and local values/practices.

Most communities in the north-east are largely agriculturalists. Despite the changes, the extent of urbanization and development continues to remain much less than other parts of India, due to the geographical isolation and relative inaccessibility. However, there is an increasing rural and urban divide. Government policies often seek to wean people away from the forest. This may end up severing the relationships that people have had with nature.

Often, the best naturalists and observers of wildlife are the hunters. Sometimes hunting surveys have resulted in finding species that were not known to be present in the region. Several such ‘discoveries’ are often due to the natural history knowledge of hunters. They often tend to have more empathy and understanding. Unless we engage with them, we lose something of value.

We have worked with several remarkable tribal people who, once they had undergone a change of heart, became strong advocates for wildlife protection. It is important not to cut off dialogue with hunters who in many instances have become protectors and advocates for wildlife. By working with individuals from different communities we have come to understand to some extent, the individual motivations of hunters. Engaging with individuals directly and with their local institutions and customary laws maybe a more effective albeit difficult and slow strategy to bring about changes.

It is important that people continue to retain past connections with nature because unless people value that – it has fewer chances of remaining. Several examples of local initiatives are emerging and bring hope for conservation, not only because it helps wildlife but also because many people now appear to have a different relationship with nature out of concern, empathy, curiosity, and local pride. Many younger people are now engaged with ‘hunting’ and observing wildlife (including birds, butterflies and moths) with cameras and binoculars and taking pride in their natural heritage.

104,"The world of succulents and dry garden plants is a huge and encompassing one, but there is one unique subgroup I call Large Non-Spiny Dry Garden plants. I'm shining a light on four such stellar citizens: aloes, agaves, yuccas and aeoniums. Today we get to meet a few of the “softies.”

Agaves

Agaves are some of the spiniest “ouch” plants out there, but there are several exceptions. Start with the soft-as-butter Agave attenuata. The straight species of this Central Mexican agave forms a rosette of 4 to 5 feet tall and up to 8 feet wide. Six-inch wide bluish-green leaves taper to a point at the tips, and the striking rosette often tilts forward slightly, giving it the appearance of a very large green flower. Mature plants send up a 5- to 10-foot vertical flower stalk populated with small creamy flowers that curve downward, giving this long-lived succulent the common name foxtail agave. Three varieties add interest: the creamy-margined ‘Ray of Light,’ the glaucous blue of ‘Boutin’s Blue’ and the yellow-and-green-striped patterns of A. attenuata variegata.

The humorously named octopus agave does indeed resemble that sea creature, with its multitude of arching bluish-green “tentacles.” The rosette of soft leaves matures to be 3 to 4 feet tall and 5 to 6 feet wide. Pretty on its own, when it does eventually bloom it makes one of the most dramatic flower spikes you’ve ever seen. Towering at 15 to 20 feet, the thousands of tiny yellow flowers make an ascending spiral that is breathtaking! It doesn't pup but produces lots of plantlets along the bloom spike for starting new specimens.

Aloes

Aloe plicatilis is one of the most unique and easily recognized “friendly” aloes. Called fan aloe, it produces upward-curving footlong stems that are a lovely bluish-gray. With six to eight of these parallel stems on each side, it looks very much like a living candelabra. Not as fussy about soil as some succulents, it still appreciates well-drained soil and lots of sun. It makes a striking container plant.

Also memorable is the vigorous Aloe striata. Named coral aloe for the pink edge on its broad and thick greenish-blue leaves, it grows quickly to form an 18-inch high by 24-inch wide specimen. A beautifully symmetrical plant with darker lines on each leaf, in midwinter it will send up sturdy stems topped by clusters of orange tubular flowers much beloved by hummers.

Also distinctive is the lovely spiral aloe (A. polyphylla). Its rosette is formed by densely packed and parallel spirals of lightly toothed, tapered succulent leaves. Although it takes a few years for young plants to achieve this effect, the fact that the plants tilt slightly forward makes the spiraling that much more visually apparent. This is one aloe worth waiting for.

Yuccas

Yuccas are another incredibly diverse genus with 50 species dispersed among the Americas (with many found in Mexico and Central America). The ouchless species include the lovely soft leaf yucca (Y. recurvifolia). Arching bluish-green strap-shape leaves gradually multiply to form a clump roughly 4 to 6 feet high. From this emerge 8-feet tall spikes in summer, each smothered in nodding, cup-shape alabaster flowers. Although leaf tips have a sharp point, the plant is safe enough to plant in places that see a lot of foot traffic.

Yucca desmetiana ‘Blue Boy’ is an outstanding specimen, showing off dusky purple foliage on leaves that form a soft spilling fountain. Adaptable to the heat or foggy conditions, this resilient yucca seems to thrive wherever it’s placed. In time, it produces spikes of cup-shape white flowers, but in the meantime you have that lovely amethyst-hued foliage.

Yucca flaccida ‘Golden Sword’ makes a bold statement with its green-and-yellow swordlike leaves. Similar in appearance to a Phormium, it distinguishes itself in the spring with spikes of fragrant, ivory-white blooms. Its eye-catching variegation is great for adding contrast, and its modest size (2 by 3 feet) makes it a perfect choice for containers.

Aeoniums

No need to search out the soft aeoniums. They all feature waxy soft leaves! They buck the trend and are mostly found in the Madeira region of Portugal and northern Africa. Start with everyone's favorite, the aptly named black rose aeonium (A. arboreum ‘Zwartkop’). With its eggplant-purple leaves, which from any distance look genuinely black, it provides instant contrast to any plant nearby. Reaching a sizable 3 feet by 2 feet, it forms forking branches at the base, each of which is terminated by a rosette of black petals. These rosettes can reach a foot across. This sun-loving succulent will want excellent drainage and protection from frost.

Similar in appearance is Aeonium undulatum ‘Cyclops.’ This large species can reach 4 feet tall with each rosette up to 18 inches in diameter. It features spoon-shape leaves that are a vibrant green tipped with reddish-brown, making for a dramatic show. Although slow to flower, it will sprout clusters of tiny yellow flowers in summer.

Want to go big or go home? Aeonium escobarii produces green rosettes that can span an amazing 3 feet! Sprays of tiny star-shape white flowers appear in summer. Pups out to form a little ‘hen and chicks’ colony. A real statement wherever it’s situated.

105,"The tiny Dutch island of Bonaire, just off Venezuela’s coast, is definitely having a moment.

While parts of the Caribbean are still rebuilding following several seasons of far-reaching hurricanes, this gem is quickly becoming a household name as more and more hoteliers and cruise ship lines are targeting the island for the long-haul future. Along with sister islands Aruba and Curaçao, Bonaire holds the rare distinction of lying outside the hurricane belt. In other words, all the sun and sea with none of the summer and autumn risk.

For travelers, this means the options for cruise ship excursions is growing exponentially.

Prior to this recent boon, Bonaire, roughly the same size as the city of Tampa, had largely been somewhat of a two-trick pony dedicated to scuba diving along with windsurfing/kitesurfing. Scuba divers prize Bonaire for its reefs, the world’s first to be protected as a marine sanctuary established in 1979. Just offshore, corals pop with as much color as candy stores. Plus, the destination’s gin-clear water means you don’t need to dunk yourself to appreciate the underwater views, but simply ride, float or paddle across the surface.

The second draw for sporty types is Bonaire’s steady-to-strong winds. Since the 1980s, windsurfers have flocked to Lac Bay, three square miles of protected flat waters on the southeast coast, perfect for beginners to learn the sport and for pros to train year-round. In recent years, the area has grown to include a lineup of beach bars offering smoothies, blended coffee drinks and light lunches, allowing families and groups of friends to stay all day. There’s even a hotel, the Sorobon Beach Resort, offering daily yoga and massage in addition to stand-alone chalets with hammocks and open-air showers.

On the opposite coast, kitesurfers cluster at the beach named in their honor—Kite Beach—a 20-minute drive south from the main city of Kralendijk. This sport, decades younger than windsurfing, is still up and coming. Travelers can see this reflected in the infrastructure. Whereas Lac Bay has permanent beach bars and retail shops, the kitesurfing instruction and gear rentals are offered from converted school buses. One such operator is Bonaire Kite School, offering private and semi-private lessons; instructors are certified through the International Kiteboarding Organization. By the end of one session, even first-timers can learn to fly the kite, harnessing its power to body-drag (ride through the water without the board) for a thrill that’s as joyous as sledding.

These sports might be part of the island’s history, but its future is much more diverse.

Newcomers to Bonaire might want a tour to learn the lay of this boomerang-shaped island, much of which is desert. Bonaire Cruisers offers six-hour guided trips where guests drive six-seater, open-air, off-road Yamaha Grizzly vehicles. Routes highlight the north and south, giving day-trippers a background of the island’s history as a salt producer, as well as the chance to tear it up on the winding dirt backroads.

For a more active day of exploring, try Bonaire Eco Cycling. With this boutique operator, guests pedal electric bikes along the southern coast, stopping at the lighthouse and historic huts where slaves of the 19th-century salt industry slept. Because the cycles are electric, participants have the option of assistance from the motor, guaranteeing a relaxing excursion.

Riders who prefer to pedal can mountain bike the ridges of Washington Slagbaai National Park, a 14,000-acre wild area, home to iguanas, parrots, flamingos and parakeets. Bike Rental Bonaire has a fleet of loaner 21-speed mountain bikes, allowing cyclists to tackle the mountains to the north, the dirt roads of the interior or the coastal flat trails.

With an understanding of the island, most visitors rent a car for a few days, if not the entirety of their stay. A rental car isn’t a must on Bonaire, as most of the restaurants, from Capriccio serving homemade pasta to the Mediterranean hotspot Mezze, are found in downtown Kralendijk, all within walking distance of one another. However, because most visitors plan on driving to dive sites or a beach during their time on the island many hotels and resorts offer packages with rental cars.

This allows travelers to see more at their own pace, including one unique attraction: the Donkey Sanctuary. In 1993, Marina Melis created this safe haven for the animals that were once vital to the salt industry, but then abandoned. Guests pay an entry fee to drive the park and meet the donkeys, most of whom are so curious and eager for attention that they’ll crane their heads inside of your car, sometimes three or four at a time, if the windows are rolled down.

Tour enough of the island, and you’ll pick up on the fact that although Bonaire does have beautiful beaches, they’re not of the typical white-sand variety. You’ll find long stretches of small pebbles. This is why the destination, to date, has been nowhere near as popular as neighboring Aruba. But if you do explore Bonaire, you’ll also see that a Caribbean escape need not center solely on the beach. Not when there’s so much action packed into one small—but no-doubt-happening—paradise.

Because the cycles are electric, participants have the option of assistance from the motor, guaranteeing a relaxing excursion.

Riders who prefer to pedal can mountain bike the ridges of Washington Slagbaai National Park, a 14,000-acre wild area, home to iguanas, parrots, flamingos and parakeets. Bike Rental Bonaire has a fleet of loaner 21-speed mountain bikes, allowing cyclists to tackle the mountains to the north, the dirt roads of the interior or the coastal flat trails.

With an understanding of the island, most visitors rent a car for a few days, if not the entirety of their stay. A rental car isn’t a must on Bonaire, as most of the restaurants, from Capriccio serving homemade pasta to the Mediterranean hotspot Mezze, are found in downtown Kralendijk, all within walking distance of one another. However, because most visitors plan on driving to dive sites or a beach during their time on the island many hotels and resorts offer packages with rental cars.

This allows travelers to see more at their own pace, including one unique attraction: the Donkey Sanctuary. In 1993, Marina Melis created this safe haven for the animals that were once vital to the salt industry, but then abandoned. Guests pay an entry fee to drive the park and meet the donkeys, most of whom are so curious and eager for attention that they’ll crane their heads inside of your car, sometimes three or four at a time, if the windows are rolled down.

Tour enough of the island, and you’ll pick up on the fact that although Bonaire does have beautiful beaches, they’re not of the typical white-sand variety. You’ll find long stretches of small pebbles. This is why the destination, to date, has been nowhere near as popular as neighboring Aruba. But if you do explore Bonaire, you’ll also see that a Caribbean escape need not center solely on the beach. Not when there’s so much action packed into one small—but no-doubt-happening—paradise.

Members of the public will soon have an opportunity to review and comment on a draft environmental impact statement and supplemental environmental impact report associated with a new Habitat Conservation Plan for the Santa Ana Wash area.

The San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will host two public meetings on the proposal, both on January 9, at the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation District office, 1630 West Redlands Boulevard, Suite A, Redlands. The meetings will be held from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Requests for sign language interpreting services, closed captioning or other accommodations should be directed to Karin Cleary-Rose, TTY 800-877-8339 by close of business on January 6.

The meetings will review the Upper Santa Ana River Wash Habitat Conservation Plan (Wash Plan) as analyzed in the Draft Environmental Impact Statement and Supplemental Environmental Impact Report. The Wash Plan proposes a coordinated process for permitting and mitigating specific public and private projects such as aggregate mining, water conservation, wells and water infrastructure, transportation, flood control, trails, habitat enhancement and agriculture.

Implementation of these covered activities may result in impacts to five endangered species: the slender-horned spineflower, Santa Ana River woolly-star, cactus wren, California gnatcatcher and San Bernardino kangaroo rat.

Approval of the Wash Plan would provide the District with an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) under Section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Federal Endangered Species Act, and allow the Conservation District to extend such take coverage to other participating entities implementing covered projects through a Certificate of Inclusion process. The SEIR adds to and revises the 2008 EIR approved by the Conservation District over 10 years ago.

Dan Silver, the executive director of Endangered Habitat League, a regional habitat conservation plan expert who participated in the project’s development, said the plan achieves a mutually beneficial balance between land uses at the wash.

“It protects and manages a rare community of life along Santa Ana River, and simultaneously ensures compatible economic activity,” he said. “It also shows how the Endangered Species Act can be successfully implemented when there is strong local leadership and collaboration.”

U.S. Rep. Paul Cook (R-Apple Valley), who worked with Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Redlands) on the Wash Plan legislation allowing for the land transfer, agreed — calling the project a win for the economy and a win for the environment.

“This will align local land ownership with appropriate uses, setting aside already disturbed land for aggregate mining and setting aside important habitat for conservation purposes,” he said.

The 4,900-acre Wash Plan was developed over many years by a local Wash Plan Task Force made up of the cities of Highland and Redlands; the SBVWCD, East Valley Water District, and San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District; CEMEX and Robertson’s Ready Mix; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, California Department of Fish and Game, Inland Valley Development Agency and the Endangered Habitats League.

108,"Rainforest Trust has always had a special relationship with the tropical landscapes of Latin America and the Caribbean. Our first project ever was in Guatemala, protecting an irreplaceable patch of forest. In addition, some of the most consequential projects of our first two decades took place in Ecuador, Colombia and Peru.

But this year, as fires raged across the Amazon rainforest, conservation in Latin America and the Caribbean seemed more relevant than ever. As we grappled with that news, we grew even more committed to our conservation work in the region.

And that effort paid off. In 2019, Rainforest Trust helped protect almost 2.4 million acres of habitat in Latin America and the Caribbean. Most of those acres came from Bolivia, where we worked with Wildlife Conservation Society – Bolivia and local governments to create the Rhukanrhuka Municipal Reserve. This 2.1 million-acre reserve protects part of the Beni grasslands, South America’s third-largest savannah.

The Beni grasslands lie at the foot of the Andes, next to riverine and forested land. This location contributes to the unique geography and wildlife community of the area. Once a year, most of the land floods as rain comes down from the highlands. This deluge makes the area a vital habitat for birds like Black-collared Hawks, Sungrebes and Wood Storks. Mammals in the area include Maned Wolves, Jaguars and the Endangered Black-faced Black Spider Monkeys. The reserve now also protects two titi monkey species endemic to this region.

Rhukanrhuka is a joint creation of conservation NGOs and local communities. Stakeholders from these communities, including ranchers, farmers and local leaders, are helping to plan — and now manage — this reserve. Through this process, they’ve been able to align their livelihoods with a more sustainable future for the ecosystem. In fact, the project was such a success that the reserve is twice its intended size. As more people saw the benefits to come, more people participated and the reserve grew in size.

Up in Ecuador, Rainforest Trust, American Bird Conservancy and Fundación Jocotoco established the new Las Balsas Communal Reserve. This area protects forests home to the Lilacine Amazon, a recently described and Endangered parrot species. Both habitat loss and poaching for the pet trade threaten the bird, but this new reserve will offer protection and management to mitigate those threats.

Further north, in Mexico’s Chihuahan Desert, Rainforest Trust worked with HABIO, A.C., The Turtle Conservancy and Global Wildlife Conservation to purchase an 18,850-acre ranch and turn it into a protected area. This desert area is home to species like lizards, kangaroo rats and cacti. But the most striking resident is the Critically Endangered Bolson Tortoise. The Bolson Tortoise is the largest tortoise species in North America and under immense threat from hunting and habitat loss. HABIO, A.C. is already working to restore this habitat after years of degradation from cattle grazing.

Over in the Caribbean, we helped establish a new protected area in Haiti. This reserve, Grand Bois, was created with Haiti National Trust and Société Audubon Haiti, with support from Global Wildlife Conservation. These 1,200 acres are in one of the world’s most important spots for amphibian conservation — at least 19 resident amphibian species are Critically Endangered. The reserve now protects the area from nearby and expanding logging and agriculture.

In addition to creating new reserves, we worked with our partners to expand existing reserves in Ecuador, Colombia, the Cayman Islands and Guatemala. This included both reserves we’ve worked on before and in locations new to us. This work improves the efficiency and value of these existing areas.

We also continued our work with the Center for the Development of an Indigenous Amazon (CEDIA) in Peru to help title indigenous lands. Many indigenous communities in the Peruvian Amazon have historically lacked legal rights to their land. Without those rights, that land can be signed over to logging or mining companies that could destroy both the forest ecosystem and these communities’ livelihoods. But indigenous communities can also be key partners in conservation. When given rights to their land, indigenous communities in Peru keep those forests mostly intact. Through this work with CEDIA, we support both community empowerment and wildlife conservation in the world’s largest rainforest.

The news about the burning Amazon this year didn’t surprise us at Rainforest Trust. We’ve been fighting deforestation in Latin America and the Caribbean for decades. In that time, we’ve seen entire landscapes and species disappear. But we’ve also seen what can happen when conservationists and communities work together. We’ve seen what can happen when we work hard for a more sustainable future.

And those stories give us something even more valuable than experience. Those stories give us hope.

Help us continue this hopeful work next year. Your support will safeguard habitat for species like parrots and orchids, secure necessary resources for communities across North and South America and help protect the entire planet from climate change.

Donate now to support our ongoing conservation work as we work to further protect land in Ecuador, Brazil, Peru and more.

109,"AsianScientist (Jan. 21, 2020) – With its efforts to preserve green spaces in the face of rapid modernization, Singapore has earned itself international repute as a garden city. But that is not to say there have been no casualties in the march of progress.

Residing in Singapore’s Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the island nation’s largest nature reserve spanning more than 2,000 hectares of forested land, is a species of monkey known as the Raffles Banded Langur. So named because they were discovered by Sir Stamford Raffles two centuries ago, the population of Raffles Banded Langurs has dwindled to just 60 in recent years.

Leading the movement to conserve this critically endangered species is Dr. Andie Ang, a primatologist at the Wildlife Reserve Singapore Conservation Fund and the president of the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore). She chairs the Raffles’ Banded Langur Working Group, set up in August 2016 to monitor and gather data on the monkeys and use that information to direct initiatives to secure the species’ future.

“I believe in doing research and collecting data that can eventually help in conservation efforts. I’m not purely an academic where I just collect data for scientific purposes,” Ang told Asian Scientist Magazine. “At the same time, I don’t believe in just doing conservation without the scientific background. I want to do data-driven, evidence-based conservation.”

Ang’s passion for primates was sparked at a young age when her family received a juvenile wild vervet monkey as a gift. Just ten years old then, Ang was ignorant of the fact that the monkey was illegally taken from Zambia, but came to learn that the monkey did not belong in her home as a pet. She credits that close encounter with the monkey for putting her on the path of primate conservation.

For her work, Ang travels to countries in the region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, to understand the habits of not only the Raffles Banded Langur, but also other monkey species like the Indochinese silvered langur and the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey.

“In terms of conservation, it is very important to know the monkeys’ feeding preferences. For example, the monkeys that I studied, they are mostly vegetarian, so they only eat leaves, flowers and fruits—they’re very selective,” Ang explained.

She added that by understanding the monkeys’ feeding preferences—some of which might be seasonal—one can begin to infer their migration patterns and how they fit into the overall ecosystem of an area. Since food choice and availability influences migration, Ang noted that the data from field studies could even facilitate the repopulation of degraded land, such as land which was previously used as a dumping site.

“So you don’t just remediate an area with any plant species, but take a very targeted approach,” she said.

Ang also highlighted her ambition to make primate watching as popular as bird watching.

“Did you know that bird watching is a multi-billion-dollar industry? People spend a lot of money just to go to places to find that particular species of bird they want to take a good photograph of. In the process, they’re helping the ecotourism in that area and supporting community development, because you have to protect the forest in order to have the birds there,” she said.

However, the popularization of primate watching is hobbled by the lack of sufficient information resources on where to find the various primate species. Ang is attempting to change that with primatewatching.com.

“There are, at the moment, 511 species of primates globally, and my aim is to put up a page for each and every species,” she quipped, adding that the site also lists the success rate of spotting those species in their natural habitats. “So my aim is to provide a free platform for people to find out where they can go to see different primates in their natural habitat, then go to the area to learn more about the community and how they can help in conserving those habitats,” she said.

Ang’s passion for primates was sparked at a young age when her family received a juvenile wild vervet monkey as a gift. Just ten years old then, Ang was ignorant of the fact that the monkey was illegally taken from Zambia, but came to learn that the monkey did not belong in her home as a pet. She credits that close encounter with the monkey for putting her on the path of primate conservation.

For her work, Ang travels to countries in the region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, to understand the habits of not only the Raffles Banded Langur, but also other monkey species like the Indochinese silvered langur and the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey.

“In terms of conservation, it is very important to know the monkeys’ feeding preferences. For example, the monkeys that I studied, they are mostly vegetarian, so they only eat leaves, flowers and fruits—they’re very selective,” Ang explained.

She added that by understanding the monkeys’ feeding preferences—some of which might be seasonal—one can begin to infer their migration patterns and how they fit into the overall ecosystem of an area. Since food choice and availability influences migration, Ang noted that the data from field studies could even facilitate the repopulation of degraded land, such as land which was previously used as a dumping site.

“So you don’t just remediate an area with any plant species, but take a very targeted approach,” she said.

Ang also highlighted her ambition to make primate watching as popular as bird watching.

“Did you know that bird watching is a multi-billion-dollar industry? People spend a lot of money just to go to places to find that particular species of bird they want to take a good photograph of. In the process, they’re helping the ecotourism in that area and supporting community development, because you have to protect the forest in order to have the birds there,” she said.

However, the popularization of primate watching is hobbled by the lack of sufficient information resources on where to find the various primate species. Ang is attempting to change that with primatewatching.com.

“There are, at the moment, 511 species of primates globally, and my aim is to put up a page for each and every species,” she quipped, adding that the site also lists the success rate of spotting those species in their natural habitats. “So my aim is to provide a free platform for people to find out where they can go to see different primates in their natural habitat, then go to the area to learn more about the community and how they can help in conserving those habitats,” she said.

As the sun recedes, a ram bolts east toward the mountains on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe’s land on Jan. 13

Tribal members, conservationists and students, bundled up in thick coats and beanies, gathered in two rows fanning out from transport trailers to watch the release into tribal land, an area usually closed to the public. Bighorn sheep, separated into two trailers, rushed out in waves.

First came the ewes. The rams came next. As the sun went down behind Pyramid Lake, more than 20 sheep leaped off transport trailers and sprinted back to their historic range.

Reintroducing bighorn sheep to the Lake Range “was something that we needed to do,” said Alan Mandell, the vice chairman of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. Once numerous on the peaks above Pyramid Lake, bighorn sheep have not been seen in the mountains for about a century.

For decades, tribal officials and conservationists worked with state wildlife managers to figure out a way to reintroduce bighorn sheep to the Lake Range, which rises east of the desert lake. Bighorn sheep all but disappeared on the tribe’s land — and across the West — in the early 1900s as Western expansion decimated their ranks through disease and overhunting.

With the reintroduction, on a brisk January evening last week, that began to change.

“It was such a magnificent moment because the smiles on their faces — their respect, their worship, their appreciation of these animals,” said Larry Johnson, who leads Nevada’s Coalition for Wildlife. “I wish we could somehow transfer that respect and awe of wildlife to the general public of Nevada and garner the kind of support that was exhibited on the reservation.”

Now the sheep are heading north. Biologists believe that the bighorn sheep will repopulate in the area around Hell’s Kitchen Canyon. It’s on Pyramid Lake’s northeast shore and it leads up to rocky terrain. There are natural water sources and good vegetation at high elevations. And the rugged terrain provides plenty of escape routes.

“Mountain lions aren’t as quick on the rocks,” said Emily Hagler, a biologist for the tribe.

The release earlier this month was a daylong effort years in the making. Before the sheep could be let out to roam free, biologists and other state officials needed to capture them.

Around 4:45 a.m. on Jan. 13, long before the sun rose and hundreds of miles away from the reservation near Reno, a team of tribal leaders and state wildlife managers left Winnemucca. They headed to a staging area in the Sheep Creek Range northeast of Battle Mountain.

“We got there just as the sun was rising,” Hagler said in an interview recounting the day.

Soon after, a helicopter crew took off. The crew was charged with capturing bighorn sheep using a net gun and flying them back to the staging area. There, they were tagged with location monitors, and an NDOW veterinarian examined their vital signs, a critical step.

The stress of a capture can drive up body temperatures in sheep — a possible sign of “capture myopathy,” a disease that results in muscle damage and is often deadly.

“We had some hot temperatures that we didn’t like to see on the animals,” Mike Cox, a bighorn staff biologist with the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW), said in an interview this week.

Cox has worked on dozens of captures, and rarely misses one. He said that he once showed up to a capture on crutches and a broken leg. And in any given year, Cox said NDOW might capture about 150 bighorn sheep, checking them for disease or relocating sheep to repopulate historic ranges. In that sense, the capture last week was a routine operation for wildlife officials.

Then he stopped himself:

“But it’s more than just another one.”

It marked the first time that the state agency has released bighorn sheep on tribal land in Nevada. For the tribe, it was another step in recovering wildlife lost to Western expansion.

“We didn’t do nice things to the land during the settlement of the West,” Johnson said.

There is a sparse written record of bighorn sheep at Pyramid Lake. But sheep are documented on petroglyphs dating back thousands of years. Coming upon Pyramid Lake, the explorer John C. Frémont noted “herds of mountain sheep” in an 1844 journal entry. Mandell said that some bighorn sheep bones have been found in old fire pits. Traditionally, the sheep provided the tribe with sustenance, Hagler said. Horns were used in ceremony and hides were used for clothes.

That was until they vanished from the landscape. Sheep were not the only culturally-connected wildlife extirpated by Western settlement. Mandell described the bighorn sheep release as fitting into a broader recovery, especially around the tribe’s efforts to restore native fish species.

In the early 1900s, the federal government helped construct a dam on the Truckee River to bring irrigation water to nearby Fallon. But doing so diverted water away from Pyramid Lake, disrupting fish habitats and access to spawning grounds for the cui-ui and the cutthroat trout, two fish species that tribal members relied on for food and to support their local economy.

After decades, cutthroat trout were eventually reintroduced to Pyramid Lake, translocated from populations of fish at Summit Lake in Humboldt County.

“This is just another species that we’ve re-introduced and will manage,” Mandell said.

By mid-afternoon, after the trailers left the staging area near Battle Mountain, tribal members gathered at a gym on the reservation for a potluck. Around 3:30 p.m., they left in a long line of vehicles caravanning up a road around the east side of the lake and toward the release area.

After the trailers eventually arrived as the sun began to set, tribal member Terrence Wright led the group in a prayer. Wright said it was neat to see a project that would bridge generations.

“I told my grandson,” he said after the release, “one day you can tell your grandkids that you helped bring them down. It’s really neat because a lot of the things we do are for our kids.”

The release began, and sheep started darting out of the trailers.

And then an ewe stumbled out of the trailer and fell onto the ground, as the other ewes continued running away in the distance. The crowd grew silent. NDOW officials rushed around the ewe. She was diagnosed with capture myopathy, suffering damage to her back leg and hip, Cox said. The NDOW team huddled around the sheep long after the only light came from car headlights.

By the next morning, the ewe had passed away.

“It was sad,” Mandell said, pausing. “It was sad.”

The effects of capture myopathy can last about two weeks. Another setback: Six days after the release, a ram passed away, said Cox, who had not yet seen the results of the necropsy.

Although predators remain a threat to the sheep, the goal now will be to grow the population into the hundreds over the next decade. Depending on habitat conditions, Cox said the 20 remaining sheep could increase to 30 next year, reaching about 100 in six to seven years. On the phone, Cox sounded hopeful. The reservation’s habitat, he said, was “tailor-made” for sheep.

The effort to protect and preserve the population will be led by the tribe. Hagler said that serving as the lead agency was significant, “an expression of the tribe’s sovereign rights to self-govern.”

Since the release, she has watched the bighorn sheep disperse into the range. She said they are herding up and heading north toward the rocky areas that should protect them from lions.

“A few haven’t quite found their friends yet,” she said. “But they should find them soon.”

111,"Surf Uncrowded Breaks On Costa Rica’s Caribbean Side

Previous Next A break near Manzanillo, south of Puerto Viejo (Ryan Krueger/Tandem) Cahuita National Park (David Yawalkar/Eyeem) Hotel Aguas Claras (Courtesy Matias Sauter and Danie)

Costa Rica has become one of the world’s most popular surf destinations, and with that status have come concerns that the country could lose its pura vida vibe. The once sleepy towns of Tamarindo, Nosara, and Santa Teresa are on surfers’ radars, and on the Pacific coast in Pavones—which boasts the second-longest left break in the world—the waves are often packed. But you should still go, and consider the less visited Caribbean side. In the small coastal town of Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, four hours southeast of San José, you’ll find 50 miles of white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and waves for every skill level. The main draw is Salsa Brava, a heavy, barreling reef break reminiscent of Oahu’s North Shore. But Playa Negra is perfect for foam-top-riding newbies, and Punta Uva for intermediates craving easy rides without drama. Those who want to test the waters before trying out Salsa Brava can hire a boat in Limón to reach Uvita Island, a punchy reef break.

Stay at the year-old Hotel Aguas Claras on Playa Chiquita (from $290, breakfast included). The vision of Costa Rican artist Elizabeth Steinvorth and her daughter Elena Rohrmoser, it has six suites and six bungalows perched in tropical gardens, a restaurant, and bars and nightclubs nearby. Given the area’s rainforest, you’ll have no shortage of options if the surf’s not up. Kayak or SUP the Punta Uva River in search of monkeys and toucans, or get close to sloths and wildcats on a walk at the Jaguar Rescue Center. Cahuita National Park is a 30-minute drive from the hotel and laced with well-marked hiking trails that lead to snorkeling spots rich with marine life. From May to October, you’re likely to glimpse leatherback turtles hatching on the beaches. —Jen Murphy

Detour: New Adventure Bases

Kasiiya Papagayo

This off-the-grid eco-retreat on Costa Rica’s northern Pacific coast is set on 123 acres of untouched jungle, with trails that lead to two empty beaches. Between the wildlife view­ing (howler monkeys in the trees, eagle rays and turtles in the sea) and five palatial tented suites, Kasiiya rivals the most over-the-top African safari stays. (From $615)

Senda Monteverde Hotel

If spotting a jewel-toned quetzal and two-toed sloths are on your wish list, then this new 24-room lodge, three hours northwest of San José, is a dream base. A hanging bridge connects the property to Aguti Wildlife Reserve, or drive 15 minutes to Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, which is home to more than 400 species of birds, 2,500 plants, and jaguars. (From $260)

Hotel Nantipa

The project of three Costa Rican friends, this 15-room beachfront hotel is steps from some of Santa Teresa’s best surf breaks. If you aren’t a surfer, swap your sandals for hiking boots and explore nearby Monte­zuma Waterfalls and Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve. (From $320)

Shred New Trails Across Baja’s Sierra Cacachilas

When it comes to Baja, most people think humpback whales, monster Pacific swells, and jalapeño-spiced margaritas sipped on empty beaches. Now mountain bikers eager to escape winter can add their own fantasy: cycling an expanding system of singletrack at Rancho Cacachilas, a solar-powered adventure resort with access to 34,600 acres in the Sierra Cacachilas between La Paz and kiteboarding hub La Ventana. Since 2014, an International Mountain Biking Association–trained, 15-person crew has been building what will eventually be 43 miles of singletrack on the ranch, with an eye toward erosion control and water management, which means the trails won’t be washed away in the next flash flood.

Twenty-five miles are complete, giving intermediate and advanced riders a few days’ worth of exploration in a trail system that feels like an arid Fruita, Colorado, with saguaro cactus and killer ocean views. The ten-mile Sky Trail will be finished in June and peaks at a summit that overlooks the sea before spilling into a giggle-out-loud downhill. Rancho Cacachilas also offers hiking and bird-watching, as well as on-site workshops in cheesemaking and seed storage. Or just kick back by the pool with a cocktail and take in the expansive view of Cerralvo Island in the Sea of Cortez. —Stephanie Pearson

Access and Resources

Where to stay: With a direct line to the trails, Rancho Cacachilas’s rustic main lodging area Chivato has eight safari-style glamping tents and four rooms, plus outdoor showers and a small pool overlooking the sea. The minimum stay is two nights (from $175), which includes ac­commodations, food, and activities. The ranch is open from October 1 to May 31.

Other activities: For a change of pace, guests can sign up for ROW Adventures’ eight-day Sea to Mountains Adventure, which involves four days of sea-kayaking the wildlife-rich waters near Espíritu Santo Island, followed by four nights at the ranch (from $2,040). Or take a six-hour camp ($399) or two-hour private lesson (from $190) with Evolution Kiteboarding in nearby La Ventana.

Need to know: Don’t bother renting a car—shuttle buses are available from Los Cabos Airport to La Paz; from there, guests catch a private shuttle to the ranch. The Mountain and Bike Hub, an on-site rental and repair shop, offers high-performance dual-suspension rides (from $46 for four hours).

Snorkel and Dive the Springs of Northern Florida

As an aquatic wonder, Florida is overlooked. Some 700 freshwater springs fed by mineral-rich aquifers bubble up from the limestone sponge the state sits on. From ground-level pools that reach down 100 feet to caverns created by sinkholes, these crystalline lagoons look like a cross between a Yucatán cenote and a Caribbean reef. And at a constant 72 degrees, they’re always the ideal temperature for snorkeling and diving. The small northern outlets of Branford, Fort White, Mayo, and Old Town are prime places to start exploring, due to their close proximity to the springs and to places to stay.

An hour and a half west of Jacksonville, 2,669-acre Ichetucknee Springs State Park is a great entry point, with bream-filled cerulean pools and a diveable open-­ceiling cavern called Blue Hole. Thirty minutes west of Ichetucknee, less visited Troy Spring State Park features a sunken paddle-wheel riverboat, scuttled by Confederates as Union soldiers advanced in 1863, that makes for a good wreck-diving site. The park’s main pool, a 70-foot-deep cavern, is shaped like a funnel, with limestone formations that resemble brain coral. A dive here usually attracts hundreds of yellow-bellied slider turtles that swirl around you.

Ginnie Springs, a 35-minute drive southeast from Troy Spring, has a series of seven aquamarine pools along a two-mile trail that runs parallel to the Santa Fe River, filled with large gar, bass, and turtles. Plan a full day to snorkel or dive the springs. For technical divers, there’s also the Devil’s Spring system, with more than 30,000 feet of underground tunnels. Forty miles south, Devil’s Den Spring and nearby Blue Grotto, in the town of Williston, attract scuba and cave-certified divers, respectively, who come to explore the ancient fossil beds. Devil’s Den is a naturally lit underground pool, while Blue Grotto is 100 feet deep and has a passage to a 300-yard-long chamber. —Tony D’Souza

Where to Stay

Ichetucknee Springs Campground (from $20) is a mile from the park’s northern entrance, but consider a 20-minute drive to stay at Smoakhouse Ranch (from $100) south of Branford. There are three cabins and a three-bedroom farmhouse on-site; book Earl Cabin, a cyprus-clad 19th-century shotgun house. Snorkeling gear is sold at the general store near the south entrance, but you’ll need to bring your own diving equipment.

Primitive camping sites (from $23) dot 200-acre Ginnie Springs, many of them along the Santa Fe River. The three-bedroom Ginnie Cottage (from $175) is also located in the park and has a large deck and a fully equipped kitchen. The park’s dive center rents equipment.

In the historic Old Florida town of Micanopy, 20 minutes south of Gainesville, the 11-room, two-cottage Herlong Mansion (from $125) makes a great base for divers headed to Blue Grotto and Devil’s Den Spring. Both sites offer full gear rental.

Land Some of the Caribbean’s Most Evasive Fish in Belize

The small fishing town of Punta Gorda in southern Belize offers some of the most elusive catches on a fly. At the edge of Port Honduras Marine Reserve, the area’s flats have a thriving population of permit, as well as big schools of bonefish and tarpon. Better yet, Punta Gorda, a 50-minute turboprop flight south from Belize City, still feels undiscovered. For more than 15 years, the Garbutt brothers—Dennis, Eworth, Oliver, and Scully—have been slowly putting the town on the map. Former commercial fishermen, the brothers now run a sportfishing charter company, dive outfit, and three-cabin lodge overlooking Joe Taylor Creek, from which their boats depart (from $1,340 for three nights).

The day starts with a breakfast burrito as you motor to spots chosen by the Garbutts—sometimes a small island in the Gulf of Honduras, some­times coastal marshes, depending on tides and wind. Aboard a 23-foot super-panga with casting decks and poling platforms, your guides will propel the skiff into the shallows while searching for fish. Along the way, it’s common to spot manatees, lemon sharks, and dolphins. The brothers also have exclusive access to Lime Caye, a shallow flat 40 miles east of Punta Gorda known for its bonefish, permit, and diving sites. —Chris Santella

Where to stay: If the three cabins at Garbutt’s Fishing Lodge are booked, Copal Tree Lodge (from $179) has 16 spacious suites and a three-bedroom villa overlooking a 12,000-acre nature reserve. The hotel transports you by car to a nearby dock that the Garbutt brothers use to pick up anglers and divers.

Other activities: There are plenty of nonfishing adventures. At the southern edge of the Belize Barrier Reef, 36 miles east of Punta Gorda, snorkel or dive with manta rays, sea turtles, and, from March to June, whale sharks at Sapodillas Cayes Marine Reserve. The well-preserved Lubaantun ruins, a 19-mile drive from Punta Gorda, date back to 730 A.D. After, cool off with a swim in Hokeb Ha Cave about ten miles southwest.

When to go: December through April is high season in Belize, with clear skies and temperatures around 80 degrees. Permit and most fish species are present all year.

What to bring: While the Garbutt brothers have a few rods to loan, most anglers bring a nine- or ten-weight and floating line. Bauer and raghead crabs are popular flies.

Hike an Entire Island Along Dominica’s Waitukubuli National Trail

Previous Next A view of the Dominica coastline from the Waitukubuli National Trail (Rachid Dahnoun/Cavan) A hiker on the Waitukubuli National Trail (Rachid Dahnoun/Cavan)

This volcanic island between Martinique and Guadeloupe was well on its way to becoming the Caribbean’s top adventure destination when Hurricane Maria hit in 2017. Many of its neighbors are focused on rebuilding as quickly as possible, but Dominica is working toward a different goal. Following the hurricane, prime minister Roosevelt Skerrit pledged to make the small country of 73,000 the world’s first climate-resilient nation. In the past few months, long-awaited eco-hotels like Jungle Bay and Cabrits Resort and Spa Kempinski opened, and the country’s biggest draw, the 115-mile Waitukubuli National Trail, is expected to be complete by the spring, with final clearing efforts by volunteers, the government, and the private sector.

The entire length can be broken up into day hikes ranging from four to 11.2 miles, each showcasing a different aspect of Dominica’s dramatic topography. The first segment (4.7 miles) begins in Scotts Head Village, at the island’s southwestern tip, and traverses a wildlife-rich volcanic area and a series of hot sulphur springs. The trail culminates in the seaside village of Soufrière, where you can snorkel Soufrière–Scotts Head Marine Reserve, a bay filled with underwater fumaroles and colorful reefs. On segment four, a challenging eight-mile rainforest route, you’ll hit lookouts with views of five of the island’s peaks and traverse a deep gorge in the heart of Morne Trois Pitons National Park, home to the famous Boiling Lake, set in a lunar landscape.

Follow that with segment ten, a 4.3-mile meander through a forest that connects to the Syndicate Nature Trail. Join the island’s chief ornithologist, Bertrand “Dr. Birdy” Jno Baptiste, for a one-mile-loop detour to spot parrots endemic to the island, like the red-necked Amazon, or jaco, and the Imperial Amazon, or sisserou. Even if the rarest birds stay hidden, Dr. Birdy will make sure you spot at least a few dozen of the island’s 167 species. —Gina DeCaprio Vercesi

Jungle Bay

After being destroyed in 2015 by Tropical Storm Erika, Jungle Bay, a boutique wellness resort overlooking Soufrière–Scotts Head Marine Reserve, reopened in June. Run by a Dominican couple leading the charge on sustainable practices, the lodge uses solar energy (emitting 30 percent less carbon than traditional resorts) and has 30 eco-villas with bamboo furnishings and biodegradable bathroom products. The Waitukubuli National Trail is just an eight-minute drive south. (From $294)

Cabrits Resort and Spa Kempinski

Set adjacent to Cabrits National Park, this 151-room resort opened in October with two dining options and four swimming pools. The hotel gets an estimated 60 percent of its food from local farmers and fishermen, and it uses solar energy and a gray-water treatment system, diverting waste water to irrigation.

Costa Rica has become one of the world’s most popular surf destinations, and with that status have come concerns that the country could lose its pura vida vibe. The once sleepy towns of Tamarindo, Nosara, and Santa Teresa are on surfers’ radars, and on the Pacific coast in Pavones—which boasts the second-longest left break in the world—the waves are often packed. But you should still go, and consider the less visited Caribbean side. In the small coastal town of Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, four hours southeast of San José, you’ll find 50 miles of white-sand beaches, coral reefs, and waves for every skill level. The main draw is Salsa Brava, a heavy, barreling reef break reminiscent of Oahu’s North Shore. But Playa Negra is perfect for foam-top-riding newbies, and Punta Uva for intermediates craving easy rides without drama. Those who want to test the waters before trying out Salsa Brava can hire a boat in Limón to reach Uvita Island, a punchy reef break.

Stay at the year-old Hotel Aguas Claras on Playa Chiquita (from $290, breakfast included). The vision of Costa Rican artist Elizabeth Steinvorth and her daughter Elena Rohrmoser, it has six suites and six bungalows perched in tropical gardens, a restaurant, and bars and nightclubs nearby. Given the area’s rainforest, you’ll have no shortage of options if the surf’s not up. Kayak or SUP the Punta Uva River in search of monkeys and toucans, or get close to sloths and wildcats on a walk at the Jaguar Rescue Center. Cahuita National Park is a 30-minute drive from the hotel and laced with well-marked hiking trails that lead to snorkeling spots rich with marine life. From May to October, you’re likely to glimpse leatherback turtles hatching on the beaches. —Jen Murphy

Detour: New Adventure Bases

Kasiiya Papagayo

This off-the-grid eco-retreat on Costa Rica’s northern Pacific coast is set on 123 acres of untouched jungle, with trails that lead to two empty beaches. Between the wildlife view­ing (howler monkeys in the trees, eagle rays and turtles in the sea) and five palatial tented suites, Kasiiya rivals the most over-the-top African safari stays. (From $615)

Senda Monteverde Hotel

If spotting a jewel-toned quetzal and two-toed sloths are on your wish list, then this new 24-room lodge, three hours northwest of San José, is a dream base. A hanging bridge connects the property to Aguti Wildlife Reserve, or drive 15 minutes to Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, which is home to more than 400 species of birds, 2,500 plants, and jaguars. (From $260)

Hotel Nantipa

The project of three Costa Rican friends, this 15-room beachfront hotel is steps from some of Santa Teresa’s best surf breaks. If you aren’t a surfer, swap your sandals for hiking boots and explore nearby Monte­zuma Waterfalls and Cabo Blanco Nature Reserve. (From $320)

Shred New Trails Across Baja’s Sierra Cacachilas

When it comes to Baja, most people think humpback whales, monster Pacific swells, and jalapeño-spiced margaritas sipped on empty beaches. Now mountain bikers eager to escape winter can add their own fantasy: cycling an expanding system of singletrack at Rancho Cacachilas, a solar-powered adventure resort with access to 34,600 acres in the Sierra Cacachilas between La Paz and kiteboarding hub La Ventana. Since 2014, an International Mountain Biking Association–trained, 15-person crew has been building what will eventually be 43 miles of singletrack on the ranch, with an eye toward erosion control and water management, which means the trails won’t be washed away in the next flash flood.

Twenty-five miles are complete, giving intermediate and advanced riders a few days’ worth of exploration in a trail system that feels like an arid Fruita, Colorado, with saguaro cactus and killer ocean views. The ten-mile Sky Trail will be finished in June and peaks at a summit that overlooks the sea before spilling into a giggle-out-loud downhill. Rancho Cacachilas also offers hiking and bird-watching, as well as on-site workshops in cheesemaking and seed storage. Or just kick back by the pool with a cocktail and take in the expansive view of Cerralvo Island in the Sea of Cortez. —Stephanie Pearson

Access and Resources

Where to stay: With a direct line to the trails, Rancho Cacachilas’s rustic main lodging area Chivato has eight safari-style glamping tents and four rooms, plus outdoor showers and a small pool overlooking the sea. The minimum stay is two nights (from $175), which includes ac­commodations, food, and activities. The ranch is open from October 1 to May 31.

Other activities: For a change of pace, guests can sign up for ROW Adventures’ eight-day Sea to Mountains Adventure, which involves four days of sea-kayaking the wildlife-rich waters near Espíritu Santo Island, followed by four nights at the ranch (from $2,040). Or take a six-hour camp ($399) or two-hour private lesson (from $190) with Evolution Kiteboarding in nearby La Ventana.

Need to know: Don’t bother renting a car—shuttle buses are available from Los Cabos Airport to La Paz; from there, guests catch a private shuttle to the ranch. The Mountain and Bike Hub, an on-site rental and repair shop, offers high-performance dual-suspension rides (from $46 for four hours).

Snorkel and Dive the Springs of Northern Florida

As an aquatic wonder, Florida is overlooked. Some 700 freshwater springs fed by mineral-rich aquifers bubble up from the limestone sponge the state sits on. From ground-level pools that reach down 100 feet to caverns created by sinkholes, these crystalline lagoons look like a cross between a Yucatán cenote and a Caribbean reef. And at a constant 72 degrees, they’re always the ideal temperature for snorkeling and diving. The small northern outlets of Branford, Fort White, Mayo, and Old Town are prime places to start exploring, due to their close proximity to the springs and to places to stay.

An hour and a half west of Jacksonville, 2,669-acre Ichetucknee Springs State Park is a great entry point, with bream-filled cerulean pools and a diveable open-­ceiling cavern called Blue Hole. Thirty minutes west of Ichetucknee, less visited Troy Spring State Park features a sunken paddle-wheel riverboat, scuttled by Confederates as Union soldiers advanced in 1863, that makes for a good wreck-diving site. The park’s main pool, a 70-foot-deep cavern, is shaped like a funnel, with limestone formations that resemble brain coral. A dive here usually attracts hundreds of yellow-bellied slider turtles that swirl around you.

Ginnie Springs, a 35-minute drive southeast from Troy Spring, has a series of seven aquamarine pools along a two-mile trail that runs parallel to the Santa Fe River, filled with large gar, bass, and turtles. Plan a full day to snorkel or dive the springs. For technical divers, there’s also the Devil’s Spring system, with more than 30,000 feet of underground tunnels. Forty miles south, Devil’s Den Spring and nearby Blue Grotto, in the town of Williston, attract scuba and cave-certified divers, respectively, who come to explore the ancient fossil beds. Devil’s Den is a naturally lit underground pool, while Blue Grotto is 100 feet deep and has a passage to a 300-yard-long chamber. —Tony D’Souza

Where to Stay

Ichetucknee Springs Campground (from $20) is a mile from the park’s northern entrance, but consider a 20-minute drive to stay at Smoakhouse Ranch (from $100) south of Branford. There are three cabins and a three-bedroom farmhouse on-site; book Earl Cabin, a cyprus-clad 19th-century shotgun house. Snorkeling gear is sold at the general store near the south entrance, but you’ll need to bring your own diving equipment.

Primitive camping sites (from $23) dot 200-acre Ginnie Springs, many of them along the Santa Fe River. The three-bedroom Ginnie Cottage (from $175) is also located in the park and has a large deck and a fully equipped kitchen. The park’s dive center rents equipment.

In the historic Old Florida town of Micanopy, 20 minutes south of Gainesville, the 11-room, two-cottage Herlong Mansion (from $125) makes a great base for divers headed to Blue Grotto and Devil’s Den Spring. Both sites offer full gear rental.

Land Some of the Caribbean’s Most Evasive Fish in Belize

The small fishing town of Punta Gorda in southern Belize offers some of the most elusive catches on a fly. At the edge of Port Honduras Marine Reserve, the area’s flats have a thriving population of permit, as well as big schools of bonefish and tarpon. Better yet, Punta Gorda, a 50-minute turboprop flight south from Belize City, still feels undiscovered. For more than 15 years, the Garbutt brothers—Dennis, Eworth, Oliver, and Scully—have been slowly putting the town on the map. Former commercial fishermen, the brothers now run a sportfishing charter company, dive outfit, and three-cabin lodge overlooking Joe Taylor Creek, from which their boats depart (from $1,340 for three nights).

The day starts with a breakfast burrito as you motor to spots chosen by the Garbutts—sometimes a small island in the Gulf of Honduras, some­times coastal marshes, depending on tides and wind. Aboard a 23-foot super-panga with casting decks and poling platforms, your guides will propel the skiff into the shallows while searching for fish. Along the way, it’s common to spot manatees, lemon sharks, and dolphins. The brothers also have exclusive access to Lime Caye, a shallow flat 40 miles east of Punta Gorda known for its bonefish, permit, and diving sites. —Chris Santella

Where to stay: If the three cabins at Garbutt’s Fishing Lodge are booked, Copal Tree Lodge (from $179) has 16 spacious suites and a three-bedroom villa overlooking a 12,000-acre nature reserve. The hotel transports you by car to a nearby dock that the Garbutt brothers use to pick up anglers and divers.

Other activities: There are plenty of nonfishing adventures. At the southern edge of the Belize Barrier Reef, 36 miles east of Punta Gorda, snorkel or dive with manta rays, sea turtles, and, from March to June, whale sharks at Sapodillas Cayes Marine Reserve. The well-preserved Lubaantun ruins, a 19-mile drive from Punta Gorda, date back to 730 A.D. After, cool off with a swim in Hokeb Ha Cave about ten miles southwest.

When to go: December through April is high season in Belize, with clear skies and temperatures around 80 degrees. Permit and most fish species are present all year.

What to bring: While the Garbutt brothers have a few rods to loan, most anglers bring a nine- or ten-weight and floating line. Bauer and raghead crabs are popular flies.

Hike an Entire Island Along Dominica’s Waitukubuli National Trail

Previous Next A view of the Dominica coastline from the Waitukubuli National Trail (Rachid Dahnoun/Cavan) A hiker on the Waitukubuli National Trail (Rachid Dahnoun/Cavan)

This volcanic island between Martinique and Guadeloupe was well on its way to becoming the Caribbean’s top adventure destination when Hurricane Maria hit in 2017. Many of its neighbors are focused on rebuilding as quickly as possible, but Dominica is working toward a different goal. Following the hurricane, prime minister Roosevelt Skerrit pledged to make the small country of 73,000 the world’s first climate-resilient nation. In the past few months, long-awaited eco-hotels like Jungle Bay and Cabrits Resort and Spa Kempinski opened, and the country’s biggest draw, the 115-mile Waitukubuli National Trail, is expected to be complete by the spring, with final clearing efforts by volunteers, the government, and the private sector.

The entire length can be broken up into day hikes ranging from four to 11.2 miles, each showcasing a different aspect of Dominica’s dramatic topography. The first segment (4.7 miles) begins in Scotts Head Village, at the island’s southwestern tip, and traverses a wildlife-rich volcanic area and a series of hot sulphur springs. The trail culminates in the seaside village of Soufrière, where you can snorkel Soufrière–Scotts Head Marine Reserve, a bay filled with underwater fumaroles and colorful reefs. On segment four, a challenging eight-mile rainforest route, you’ll hit lookouts with views of five of the island’s peaks and traverse a deep gorge in the heart of Morne Trois Pitons National Park, home to the famous Boiling Lake, set in a lunar landscape.

Follow that with segment ten, a 4.3-mile meander through a forest that connects to the Syndicate Nature Trail. Join the island’s chief ornithologist, Bertrand “Dr. Birdy” Jno Baptiste, for a one-mile-loop detour to spot parrots endemic to the island, like the red-necked Amazon, or jaco, and the Imperial Amazon, or sisserou. Even if the rarest birds stay hidden, Dr. Birdy will make sure you spot at least a few dozen of the island’s 167 species. —Gina DeCaprio Vercesi

Jungle Bay

After being destroyed in 2015 by Tropical Storm Erika, Jungle Bay, a boutique wellness resort overlooking Soufrière–Scotts Head Marine Reserve, reopened in June. Run by a Dominican couple leading the charge on sustainable practices, the lodge uses solar energy (emitting 30 percent less carbon than traditional resorts) and has 30 eco-villas with bamboo furnishings and biodegradable bathroom products. The Waitukubuli National Trail is just an eight-minute drive south. (From $294)

Cabrits Resort and Spa Kempinski

Set adjacent to Cabrits National Park, this 151-room resort opened in October with two dining options and four swimming pools. The hotel gets an estimated 60 percent of its food from local farmers and fishermen, and it uses solar energy and a gray-water treatment system, diverting waste water to irrigation. Nearby, you can visit some of the island’s most spectacular beaches, SUP or snorkel crystal-clear Toucari Bay, and access Waitukubuli National Trail’s segment 12. (From $370)",NA
112,"Guanacos (Lama guanicoe) are considered critically endangered in Bolivia and Paraguay. Fewer than 200 exist in Bolivia and as few as 20 in Paraguay.

Guanacos in Bolivia and Paraguay are threatened by habitat loss and poaching. They live in the Chaco, a dry-forest ecoregion that’s one of the most heavily deforested areas on the planet.

A camera trapping project spearheaded by Bolivian and Paraguayan NGOs uncovered a population of guanacos living in a national park in Paraguay.

Meanwhile, across the border in Bolivia, an autonomous indigenous government is in the process of creating a new reserve, which, if established, would create an extensive habitat corridor for guanacos and other Chaco wildlife.

The guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the spindly, wild forebear of the llama, ranges across a broad reach of western and southern South America. While the species as a whole is not considered threatened with extinction, low numbers in Bolivia and Paraguay and continued declines there as its habitat is razed for agriculture cloud its future in both countries. But a proposed protected habitat corridor in Bolivia is giving conservationists hope that guanacos may make it there after all.

While once ranging across a large portion of Bolivia, fewer than 200 guanacos live in Bolivia today, according to the most recent estimates.

“In Bolivia, the guanaco is categorized as being critically endangered, that is, a step from extinction,” said biologist Catalina Rivadeneira, coordinator of the innovation laboratory at Natura Foundation Bolivia. “This is due to the small number of individuals. Researchers performed calculations between 2008 and 2011 and estimated that the guanaco population was below 200 individuals in the entire Bolivian Chaco.”

The Chaco is an ecoregion of primarily dry forests and savannas shared between Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil. Rivadeneira said the guanaco was considered extinct in Bolivia’s portion of the Andean plateau, which lies to the west of the country’s Chaco region; however, biologist Ángela Nuñez recorded a few individuals there in 2006. Still, the bulk of Bolivia’s scant guanaco population is found in its Chaco region.

But guanacos may not be found there for much longer. One of the most deforested areas of the planet, the Chaco’s sparse forests are disappearing at a quick clip as land is cleared for for soy plantations and cattle ranges and wildfires started by farmers and fueled by climate change rage out of control.

Across the border in Paraguay, guanacos have been very nearly relegated to memory. According to the IUCN, there may be as few as 20 animals left in the country, which lists the species as critically endangered.

María Teresa Vargas, director of Natura Foundation Bolivia, says that the main threat to the guanaco is habitat loss due to agriculture. She adds that poaching has also taken a big toll on populations in Bolivia and Paraguay.

To keep tabs on Paraguay’s sparse population, researchers conducted a monitoring project using camera traps in Médanos de Chaco National Park, which lies right over the Bolivian border. The project is a joint effort between NGOs Guyra Paraguay and Natura Foundation Bolivia.

Thirteen species have been photographed by the project’s camera traps – among them the guanaco.

“This is the first record of the guanaco that we have in the Paraguayan Chaco,” said Viviana Rojas, coordinator of the species conservation program at Guyra Paraguay.

Other species photographed include the jaguar (Panthera onca), giant anteater (Mymecophaga trydactyla), puma (Puma concolor), pampas fox (Lycalopex gymnocercus), Geoffroy’s cat (Leopardus geoffroyi), and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu).

Rojas said that monitoring went through the end of 2019, with around 1.5 million images captured.

“The objective of the project is to create an action plan with Bolivia to conserve this species,” she said.

Catalina Rivadeneira, of Natura Foundation Bolivia, said that the camera traps did not photograph any guanacos on the Bolivian side of the park. However, she added that she did see three individuals in an unprotected area there during a separate trip to the region.

This unprotected area may not be unprotected for much longer, however. Together with NGOs, the Guaraní autonomous government has proposed creating a protected area called the Área de Vida del Guajukaka (Spanish and Guaraní for “Area of Life for Guanacos”), which would cover 285,000 hectares (approximately 704,000 acres) within the municipality of Charagua Iyambae.

The Área de Vida del Guajukaka will be the fourth reserve established in the Guaraní autonomous municipality and will be located to the south of Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area. Other reserves in the area include Otuquis National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area and Ñembi Guasu Conservation Area. Together, these four protected areas would form a continuous habitat corridor.

The project is in its final phase of consultation with the 28 native communities and 76 ranchers that own land inside the proposed reserve, according to Rivadeneira. Ranchers must agree to cede portions of their land to the reserve, and communities must agree to not clear the land once it’s protected.

“We are receiving the actas comunales [records from communal assemblies] in which they indicate if they agree with the proposal,” Rivadeneira told Mongabay.

Vargas says that establishing the Área de Vida del Guajukaka in coordination with communities and private agricultural landowners represents a big step forward for the creation of conservation spaces.

“We are no longer back in the time when protected areas were defined from a desk,” Vargas said. “We want the commitment of all the actors who make up this area.”

José Ávila is responsible for coordination and planning for the autonomous government of Charagua Iyambae. He says the Guaraní people have decided to set aside 70% of their autonomous municipality for conservation, with the other 30% reserved for economic activities.

“The municipality of Charagua in Bolivia still has the best-conserved ecosystem of Chaco forest, as opposed to what is happening in the Paraguayan, Argentinian, and Brazilian Chaco,” Ávila said. “This is why protecting it is important to ensure the conservation of the species.”

113,"The old Krist’s Red Owl in downtown Sister Bay. Submitted.

In 1960, when Keith Krist’s parents, Fred and Dorothy, bought a 30-year-old grocery store in Sister Bay that had previously been owned by the Manns and Wilkes, the Krists were carrying on a family tradition of at least five generations, stretching back to Austria and southern Germany.

Keith’s grandfather, Tony Krist, had grocery stores in Chicago. Fred and Dorothy, who had been visiting Door County since the 1930s, had a slaughterhouse, meat market and sausage kitchen in Port Washington. (In the very early days, Keith said, meat markets and stores selling groceries and dry goods were generally separate, although many meat markets eventually expanded into general stores.)

The store that the Krists bought in Sister Bay became Krist’s Red Owl, located next door to Al Johnson’s original restaurant. It was an extended A-frame that had been Orin Hanson’s IGA until Johnson bought it in 1949 and renamed it Al’s Home Cooking. (The Al Johnson’s restaurant that we know and love today was built around that little diner in 1973.)

Keith Krist came up to help in the store in 1962, but he was called back into the armed service and didn’t return to Sister Bay until several years later. Soon after that, his dad purchased Lundquist’s Hardware Store next door to expand his business. Keith remembers that they purchased a lot of produce from the South Water Market in Chicago and had a semi for hauling meat from Milwaukee.

Fred Krist also built another store on the west side of Sturgeon Bay, in the complex where the Co-op is now. In 1987, he sold it and built a new, larger store – Krist’s Foods – south of Sister Bay on Highway 42. The facility also included a laundromat.

The Krist family went out of the grocery business and leased the space to Pamida in 2007. Shopko later bought out Pamida, and the Skopko store closed in 2019.

(In the very early days, Keith said, meat markets and stores selling groceries and dry goods were generally separate, although many meat markets eventually expanded into general stores.)

The store that the Krists bought in Sister Bay became Krist’s Red Owl, located next door to Al Johnson’s original restaurant. It was an extended A-frame that had been Orin Hanson’s IGA until Johnson bought it in 1949 and renamed it Al’s Home Cooking. (The Al Johnson’s restaurant that we know and love today was built around that little diner in 1973.)

Keith Krist came up to help in the store in 1962, but he was called back into the armed service and didn’t return to Sister Bay until several years later. Soon after that, his dad purchased Lundquist’s Hardware Store next door to expand his business. Keith remembers that they purchased a lot of produce from the South Water Market in Chicago and had a semi for hauling meat from Milwaukee.

Fred Krist also built another store on the west side of Sturgeon Bay, in the complex where the Co-op is now. In 1987, he sold it and built a new, larger store – Krist’s Foods – south of Sister Bay on Highway 42. The facility also included a laundromat.

The Krist family went out of the grocery business and leased the space to Pamida in 2007. Shopko later bought out Pamida, and the Skopko store closed in 2019. Keith Krist still owns the building.",NA

William and Wilhelmina Reinhard built Reinhard’s Store in 1916 on the southeast corner of Highway F and Maple Grove Road. They lived on the farm across the road, where Camp David – the home of today’s Fishstock concerts – is now located. Their grandchildren, Delores Prust Spittlemeister, Helen Prust Mueller and her twin brother, Herbert, were born at the store in the 1930s, when their parents, Herbert and Hildagard Reinhard Prust, ran it.

Helen remembered the store’s potbelly stove, a gas pump out front, and flour and sugar that came in barrels and were sold by the pound. Delores added that vinegar also came in a barrel with a pump. Local farmers provided the butter and eggs for sale, and eggs sold for eight cents per dozen. A truck came by regularly to deliver bread. Candy was moved to higher and higher shelves as the children got old enough to climb. During the winter, their father cut ice from the bay in Fish Creek and stored it in sawdust in a shed behind the store.

Times were hard. Delores remembered her parents saying that dairy farmers earned about eight dollars per month for the milk they sold, with a dollar going to the bill at their store, a dollar for cattle feed, and soon it was all gone. Victor Champeau, who lived up the road, owned the cheese factory next door, and teachers at Maple Grove School, across the road, boarded with the Prusts.

About 1940, Alfred and Margaret Franke bought the store, when their son, Allen “Toby” Franke, was five and his sister, Joanne, was three. The family lived in rooms behind the store and rented the upstairs to Smoky Bley, who worked in the cheese factory. Toby remembered “like yesterday” that his first-grade class was outside for recess when the cheese factory, which by then belonged to his parents, burned to the ground. Instead of rebuilding it, his dad tore out a wall of their living quarters to enlarge the store.

When Toby and Joanne were quarantined for six weeks with scarlet fever, their aunt, May Jarman, built a miniature snowman on the ledge outside the bedroom window to entertain them.

A few years later, John and Tessie Nippert bought the store and operated it for a number of years before selling it to William and Wilhelmina Reinhard’s son, Lawrence Reinhard, and his wife, Glenna.

By the time Gloria Hardiman and her husband bought the building from the Reinhards in 1968, locals called it the “BS Store” because older men in the neighborhood loved to sit around the stove and tell tall tales.

116,"Nature reserves involving the participation of indigenous communities have developed tourism projects for bird-watching and succeeded in curbing the capture of the red-fronted macaw, a critically endangered species that is often caught up in the illegal wildlife trade.

The Bolivian government has been promoting an action plan to conserve the species, which was expected to be approved last year.

Following President Evo Morales’s removal from office and the subsequent change in government late last year, the plan is still awaiting approval.

For 13 years, Marlene Rivas has been part of a team working to protect the red-fronted macaw (Ara rubrogenysa), a bird endemic to Bolivia that is classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.

“Before, we didn’t take care of the birds. We didn’t know they were in danger of extinction. Red-fronted macaws were captured as pets and killed because they damaged crops,” Rivas says about some of the factors pushing the species to the verge of extinction.

Now, she says, residents of the towns of San Carlos, Amaya and Perereta, in Omereque municipality, Cochabamba department, are proud to have the bird in their area. The towns are part of the Red-Fronted Macaw Nature Reserve, one of the areas dedicated to the conservation of this species.

Due to the macaw’s critical situation, refuges and bird protection areas have been set up in various parts of Bolivia. But now the hope is to go a step further with the proposed Action Plan for the Conservation of the Red-Fronted Macaw, which seeks to lay the foundations to prevent this emblematic bird from disappearing from the planet.

A refuge for the birds

The Red-Fronted Macaw Nature Reserve was established in 2006 as a private conservation area for the species by the Asociación Civil Armonía (ACA) in conjunction with the three Omereque communities. “This is the most important site for the reproduction of this species,” says Rodrigo Soria, executive director of the ACA.

For Soria, the standout result from the refuge’s operation has been the commitment of the communities to conserving the species, by preventing hunting and stopping the conflict that existed over the birds’ feeding on corn crops. Now, residents have diversified their crops and established feeding areas for the birds in the protected area.

“The most important thing is that people have understood that the red-fronted macaw is in danger of extinction, and have become empowered by this initiative, [they] are concerned about the local breeding population to the point that when they see a stranger, they approach and make sure that they are not a trafficker,” Soria says.

The reserve also has a tourist lodge dedicated to bird-watching. On the site, which covers approximately 50 hectares (124 acres), 184 bird species have been recorded, which can be seen on eBird, the app created by Cornell University’s Lab of Ornithology for bird-watchers to report sightings anywhere on the planet.

Among the other birds found in this refuge are the glittering-bellied emerald (Chlorostilbon lucidus), the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), the rufous hornero (Furnarius rufus), the Andean swift (Aeronautes andecolus) and the snowy egret (Egretta thula).

“It’s a magical place that leaves you stunned because there are birds of all colors, and they are there, near you. You don’t need binoculars to see them,” says Laura Velarde, the ACA’s tourism conservation coordinator.

Velarde says interest in bird-watching is on the rise, and that in the reserved area there are also archaeological remains from the pre-Hispanic Omereque culture, which adds to the site’s appeal. The revenue, Velarde says, benefits the communities that are part of the conservation project.

“The community has realized that it benefits from the coming of tourism because it is located in a prime position for the observation of this species,” Soria says. He adds it’s not possible to say precisely whether the red-fronted macaw population is on the increase, but the number of breeding pairs counted in this refuge is about 40 each year, in addition to those individuals that are not at the reproductive stage. Soria says the last population study was carried out in 2011, so it’s important to carry out new research to establish the current status of the species.

The path to protection

Efforts to protect the red-fronted macaw have involved the Anamal and Las Juntas communities, who, in coordination with the Foundation for the Conservation of Parrots Bolivia (CLB), have curbed the hunting of these birds, as well as the theft of the young from their nests.

Sixto Aguilar is a park ranger in the Jardin de las Cactaceas municipal protected area, in the department of Santa Cruz. An area of more than 22,000 hectares (54,400 acres) set up in 2005 for the protection of various cactus species, it has also become a refuge for the red-fronted macaw.

“There were a lot of red-fronted macaws, but they have declined drastically as a result of hunting. People set traps to catch these macaws and then sell them,” Aguilar says, adding that with the disappearance of the adults, they also lost the fledglings that died from not being fed. “That’s why they disappeared quickly.”

Things have now changed. Community members participate in surveillance of the area and receive income from visits to the protected area. In addition, an administrative committee has been established — comprising representatives from each community, the mayor and the park ranger — which is responsible for managing the area.

Jhony Salguero, director of operations for the CLB, says the distribution of the species also complicates its conservation. The red-fronted macaw inhabits inter-Andean dry forest valleys, in the departments of Santa Cruz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Potosí. “They are culturally diverse and with different customs. Often, people in the area do not know that the species is in danger of extinction. Therefore, it is important to work in a coordinated fashion,” he says.

Keeping the bird as a pet is also a well-established practice in many communities, while the conflict between birds and farmers is common, since the macaws consume corn and peanuts in this area, Salguero says.

He puts the total population of the species at about 800 individuals, according to the latest study conducted in Bolivia in 2012. Complicating the problem of its survival is its low breeding rate, Salguero says.

Other places dedicated to the conservation of the red-fronted macaw are Torotoro National Park, El Palmar National Park, the Center for Genetic Biodiversity, and Moyepampa Lacarpampa Municipal Protection Area.

Action plan drafted, stopped, and started again

In 2019, the Biodiversity and Protected Areas General Directorate (DGBAP) of the Ministry of Environment and Water was preparing an action plan for the red-fronted macaw, which was being taken up once more after being put on hold for a few years.

Rodrigo Herrera, a legal adviser to the DGBAP, said at the time that in addition to scientists, conservation organizations and the government, indigenous communities and local municipalities whose territory the species inhabits were also included.

“The proposal is aligned with what is set out in the new Constitution of Bolivia and includes the participation of all the stakeholders involved in the conservation of the red-fronted macaw,” Herrera said. “We are scheduled to present it in August 2019 and we hope to finish the year with the approved plan.”

The plan aimed to carry out more scientific studies, a population census, and the development of bird-watching tourism programs with indigenous communities in places where one can still see the red-fronted macaw, Herrera said.

But major political upheaval put the plan on hold, according to José Antonio Díaz-Luque, executive director of the CLB. Elections in October spawned disputes and massive protests that spilled out onto the streets. By the following month, the military had forced President Evo Morales to resign.

Díaz-Luque says the action plan is still expected to go ahead.

“The Center for Biodiversity and Genetics, the General Directorate of Biodiversity and our foundation are working to relaunch the Action Plan,” he says, “with the aim of generating a key tool for the conservation of the species.”

119,"The wide, sunny streets of Miramar, a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, give the impression of a peaceful neighborhood. On a midsummer day earlier this year, the pohutukawa trees were abloom in a blaze of red, and kids on vacation zoomed about on scooters and skateboards. But in the backyards of these homes, business, and parks, Miramar is quietly at war.

Building traps, setting out poison, and keeping a guarded watch, Miramar is out to catch Wellington’s Most Wanted — every last rat, weasel, ferret, possum, and stoat that has invaded the city. They’re doing it to save the birds.

In a land where the only surviving native terrestrial mammal species are two thumb-sized bats, these invasive species have decimated native bird populations for centuries, causing dozens of extinctions of species found nowhere else on Earth. In 2015, New Zealand’s government launched a nationwide effort called Predator Free 2050 with a $17 million (28 million New Zealand dollars) investment to rid the country’s 164,375 square miles of invasive mammals in the next three decades. It’s an audacious goal: the next largest island to purge itself of predators is tiny South Georgia Island, which covers only 1,450 square miles.

Yet as time ticks by, New Zealand is losing treasured native species, millions of dollars in agricultural and economic losses, and part of their cultural identity. “There’s a whole bunch of things that are at stake — commercial, agricultural, disease, biodiversity, cultural,” said Angus Hulme-Moir, a senior community ranger with New Zealand’s Department of Conservation.

Miramar and its neighboring suburbs, located on a spit of land jutting like a fishhook out into the South Pacific, have become the frontline for testing and refining the urban eradication methods to be deployed countrywide. Wellington hopes to be the world’s first capital city without invasive predators within 10 years — a goal that started on the Miramar Peninsula, separated from the rest of the city by an isthmus less than a mile across.

A local organization spearheading the urban effort, Predator Free Wellington, launched their first organized offensive in Miramar in June 2019. Thanks to previous conservation efforts, Miramar had already been freed of possums, leaving only rats, stoats, and weasels on the peninsula. After the first six months, the peninsula, with almost 20,000 residents, has gotten rid of weasels and trapped tens of thousands of rats. Now, they’re on the hunt for the last ones.

Some 85 million years ago, the islands that would become New Zealand split off from the rest of the supercontinent of Gondwana and evolved in isolation with just a few native mammal species. Birds that previously kept to the trees to stay away from predators found safe haven on the ground, where some took up full-time residence and lost their ability to fly.

Over the millennia, many native curiosities appeared, including giant nocturnal parrots, moas — the only bird to completely lose its wings — and the kiwi, a long-beaked, thin-feathered flightless bird cherished by New Zealanders today.

Kakariki — which means “small green parrot” in Maori — were common in the 1800s. A combination of habitat destruction, culling by farmers hoping to protect their crops, and mustelid predators have dramatically reduced their numbers since.

But the fate of the flightless and ground-nesting birds was sealed with the arrival of the first explorers from Polynesia 700 to 800 years ago. These early settlers brought along their favorite foods like sweet potatoes and taro — but also the kiore, or Polynesian rat. The flightless and ground-nesting birds, who had known no enemy, made easy targets for both rats and new settlers. Within two centuries, moas were hunted to extinction.

When the Europeans arrived en masse in the 1800s, they inadvertently brought the larger Norway and ship rats. Later, they intentionally introduced more animals, including rabbits, which escaped and proliferated, upending the island’s delicate ecology. By 1880, rabbits were already recognized as an ecological plague and mustelids — a family of carnivorous mammals encompassing weasels, stoats, and ferrets among others — were introduced to control their population. Today, those mustelids have become an even greater scourge for local bird populations.

When the first explorers from Polynesia arrived, there were estimated to be 245 bird species, a quarter of which were flightless. Today the country is noticeably quieter. Over 20 percent of birds — encompassing at least 59 species — have gone extinct, while two-thirds of city animals are exotic.

“Most of New Zealand today is a foreign landscape where you’re surrounded by exotic species,” said Doug Armstrong, a professor in conservation biology at Massey University. “Kids grow up — even our students doing ecology or conservation — never actually having seen a native lizard. They’ve never seen a native frog.”

“Most of New Zealand today is a foreign landscape where you’re surrounded by exotic species.”

This destruction, which occurred in just a few centuries, has reversed an ecosystem millions of years in the making. A 2019 report in Current Biology found that it would take 50 million years to recover the diversity of bird species lost since human colonization. And New Zealand stands to lose even more if the species that are currently threatened — roughly 30 percent of the remaining birds — go extinct. That is, if efforts like Predator Free Wellington are unsuccessful.

In the center of the peninsula, up a nondescript driveway, stands a one-story residential house that serves as the Miramar headquarters for Predator Free Wellington. It has been the base for the full-time crew who numbered 26 during the height of the campaign. This mustelid militia has become Miramar’s primary defense against predators.

In prior years, local community groups and individuals setting traps in their own backyards helped suppress predator populations, but they had been unable to wholly eliminate them. “None of that gets you to eradication,” said John Hambidge, project lead for the Miramar Peninsula program. “You have to do something that’s a whole complete step further. And that’s where we’ve started here.”

The tui, a bird endemic to New Zealand whose numbers have dramatically increased in Wellington as a result of predator free efforts.

In order to raise awareness and secure permissions to place traps uniformly across the peninsula, Predator Free Wellington canvassed door-to-door in early 2019. Chew cards — baited tags that record identifying marks left by nibbling predators — and brochures were distributed at the local library and community center. Fliers were posted around town. These early steps made a huge difference, Hambidge says, in getting the community onboard. In a recent report, Predator Free Wellington noted that 99 percent of Miramar Peninsula residents were willing to participate in the project, and a recent survey found that 92 percent of Wellingtonians supported the citywide effort.

Today, in an orderly grid across Miramar, 1,800 traps are loaded at 328-foot intervals and small chew cards have been spaced every 164 feet. At around $60 apiece, the double-ended traps were carefully placed in order to cover as much ground as possible.

“The idea is that the average home range for a female rat is [164 feet],” Hambidge said. “That’s the best guess at this stage really.”

Local scientists, who study the movements of urban rats using VHF transmitters and GPS collars, have found the urban rats seem to occupy smaller territories than their brethren in forests, likely because access to food — in the form of compost piles and garbage bins — is more available.

The traps in Miramar are baited with brodifacoum — a low-level poison — and a variety of mustelid munchies. Rabbits culled from hunts organized by the regional and city councils supply the bait for weasels. For rats, the group mainly relies on peanut butter donated by a local manufacturer, but for trickier cases they turn to Nutella. “They love this stuff,” Hambidge said of rats’ affinity for the chocolate hazelnut spread.

Throughout the program, the group has dissected and documented the rats they’ve caught, which they store in a chest freezer jokingly referred to as the “freezer of death.” Their necropsies determine if a rat has previously ingested poison, which gives a sense of how far it may have travelled, or if it’s a lactating female, suggesting there are more rats to be caught.

John Hambidge looks through the “freezer of death,” which contains rats awaiting dissection, at the Miramar headquarters in Miramar, Wellington.

“If you were to find a juvenile, that would be a concern, because you think there must be others around,” Hambidge said. “But if you just caught a big male rat, you wouldn’t be overly concerned about it.”

Particularly at this end stage, the program is highly dependent on locals keeping a lookout for rats. On one wall of the Miramar headquarters is a giant tactical map showing the locations of the traps and bait stations. Whenever a new killing or sighting is reported, Hambidge and his team make a note on the map, indicating where hotbeds of predatory activity remain. “It comes down to the community also being the eyes and ears,” Hambidge said.

Jen Rutherford, a Miramar resident, caught one of the peninsula’s remaining rats in January after months of empty traps. “I was surprised,” Rutherford said. “I was also excited to catch one, but a little sad that there were some still around.”

But community members aren’t just noticing signs of rats. They’ve also begun to see birds.

Across the city lies a 500-acre sanctuary enclosed by a 7-foot-high fence. Unlike a zoo, this 5.3-mile long fence exists to keep animals out. The sanctuary, now known as Zealandia, was declared pest free in 2000 after an intensive mammalian eradication effort. In the decades since, 18 native species, including flightless and ground-nesting birds vulnerable to invasive predators, have been released into the sanctuary.

With no overhead nets, the birds of Zealandia are free to come and go. Located so close to the city, the sanctuary’s exploding bird population has had a “halo effect” on Wellington. As larger tracts of the city become predator free, birds are moving out of the sanctuary and into backyards.

Small bait cards, which attract rodents and help experts at the Miramar headquarters track where the invasive predators still remain.

Tui, a blackbird-sized native bird, is one species that has had a notable comeback in the region, showing a 200 percent increase in reported sightings since 2011. Other species have seen similar growths: sightings of kereru, a large forest pigeon, rose 350 percent and kakariki, the red-crowned parakeet, tenfold in the past eight years.

The kaka, a large auburn parrot, is another Zealandia success story. “They are nesting both inside and outside the sanctuary now,” said Danielle Shanahan, director for Zealandia’s Center for People and Nature. “This is a species that was effectively extinct across the Wellington region.”

Zealandia has jumpstarted the growth in native bird populations in the Wellington region, but it will take continued predator-free efforts to make sure they can thrive beyond the sanctuary’s borders, where rats reign.

Back on the peninsula, Hambidge is tracking down the last rats of Miramar — the ones too fast or too smart to be caught easily. To hunt down these few dozen wily invaders, the group altered their strategy, becoming more focused. Instead of making weekly rounds to all of the traps, Hambidge and his team are now focusing on reported sightings and new kills.

“The sooner we can get there, the better, because, you know, rats can move on,” Hambidge said.

At the end of January, they estimated only a handful of ship rats remained at large. By March, Predator Free Wellington was closing in on just over 30 remaining sites of predator activity. But then, with the spread of Covid-19, New Zealand enacted a confinement program, restricting non-essential businesses and confining people to their homes. All field operations ceased, though a few exceptions were made, such as servicing the barrier along the isthmus to prevent re-invasions.

The kaka, a parrot native to New Zealand, has seen a dramatic comeback in the Wellington region, thanks in part to efforts at Zealandia.

“Unfortunately, rats are not concerned with there being a lockdown or not, and this is a risk for us,” James Willcocks, Predator Free Wellington project director, said in an email. At the same time, he added, “People have really stepped up to get involved throughout this lockdown period — we have had anecdotal reports of traps selling out at supermarkets as people clamber to get involved.”

Today, as the lockdown restrictions are easing, Predator Free Wellington is regaining momentum. The group hopes to hand over operations to the community at the end of June and move on to the next phase, using what they’ve learned to develop a plan for the rest of Wellington. The next section, extending inland from Miramar, is twice as large and much harder to protect against incursions. But residents and conservationists are hopeful.

Conservation “is a part of our DNA in New Zealand,” Shanahan said. “The Maori have this long history of taking extremely good care of the environment in New Zealand.”

“It’s taken us a while to circle back to that kaitiakitanga, that stewardship,” she continued, “but I think we’re getting there.”",The Quest to Purge New Zealand of Invasive Predators,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vdW5kYXJrLm9yZy8yMDIwLzA1LzI1L25ldy16ZWFsYW5kLWludmFzaXZlLXByZWRhdG9ycy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://undark.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/weka-1.jpg,2020-05-25,"{'sent': 'The wide, sunny streets of Miramar, a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, give the impression of a peaceful neighborhood.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['New Zealand', 'Wellington', 'Miramar']}}","The wide, sunny streets of Miramar, a suburb of Wellington, New Zealand, give the impression of a peaceful neighborhood.
