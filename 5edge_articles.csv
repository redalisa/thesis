Giant salamander numbers have fallen sharply

Numbers of the salamander, which can grow to 50kg (110lb), have fallen sharply in recent decades.

Ways to stem the decline of amphibians are being discussed at a meeting in Washington DC, which will end with the launch of a global action plan.

Some experts think the giant salamander can become a flagship conservation species like the tiger and elephant.

With a maximum length of a metre and a half (5ft), the giant salamanders of China and Japan are truly huge compared with other amphibians.

They are easy to catch, hiding in rock crevasses during the day, and people know where to find them

They are protected species; but in China, illegal hunting is bringing them within sight of extinction.

How many there are left nationally is not known; but where populations have been studied, falls of around 80% in three generations - about 45 years - have been registered.

UNSUSTAINABLE USE How amphibian species are being overexploited around the world

""Then in the 1970s, only around 2,500 to 3,000 could be harvested each year. They are easy to catch, hiding in rock crevasses during the day, and people know where to find them.""

Over-harvesting

Dr Lau chairs the working group looking at ""over-harvesting"" of amphibians at the Washington summit.

The group has collated evidence showing that a large number of species are being collected at unsustainable levels, for food, medicine, and the pet trade; it is one factor, though not the biggest, behind the global decline in amphibians which sees almost a third of species at some risk of extinction.

""China is the country where this is the biggest problem,"" said Dr Lau, ""but in many South-East Asian countries, frog is a staple food item.

""There is also a problem with African species such as the goliath frog from Cameroon, the largest frog in the world, which is hunted as food; and then there is the pet trade, with animals like the Mantellas from Madagascar.""

In the market

The meeting here also heard of widespread hunting for food and medicine in south and central America.

""In various parts of Bolivia and Peru, for example, frogs are eaten as food by locals and by tourists,"" Esteban Lavilla from the Fundacíon Miguel Lillo in Argentina told the BBC News website.

""Some recipes call for 30 frogs for a single dish. Then you have local people taking them for medicine as well; and there are connections to magic, so that for example the picture of someone may be put in the mouth of a frog and the mouth sewn up - that would be someone that you don't like.""

The deliberations here have concluded that a range of actions is needed to combat over-harvesting; developing specific plans for each threatened species, raising awareness among local people, monitoring trade, lobbying for law enforcement and introducing programmes of sustainable use where appropriate.

But the problem remains that some species are needed as a staple source of protein, while others are highly profitable.

Changing of the times

Michael Lau believes that attitudes towards amphibians are changing down the human generations.

""But nowadays the young people don't want to eat them - the mainstream sentiment has shifted to conserving wildlife.

""If older people want to eat them now, they have to go across the border.""

For some species, like the Chinese giant salamander, the question is whether mainstream sentiment will change fast enough to prevent them disappearing completely.",Hunting threat to big amphibians,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHA6Ly9uZXdzLmJiYy5jby51ay8yL2hpL3NjaWVuY2UvbmF0dXJlLzQyNTk1OTYuc3Rt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40816000/jpg/_40816538_japmarantelli_203.jpg,2005-09-19,"{'sent': 'By Richard Black\n\nEnvironment Correspondent, BBC News website, Washington DC\n\n\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Richard Black'], 'ORG': ['BBC News'], 'GPE': ['Washington']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"Steven Brooks grew up in the Hudson Valley of New York and found the love of his life there, but he couldn't find a job to support himself and Lauren, the woman he wanted to marry.

So he bought a farm. A lizard farm. In Montevallo.

""I was looking for a lizard that this place sells,"" Brooks said. ""I saw on the website the farm was for sale.

""I went to Lauren and joked about buying it, and then I went to my parents and joked about it.""

His parents didn't think it was so funny; they liked the idea.

That's how a 24-year-old New Yorker wound up buying a lizard breeding facility established by a man known throughout the world for his work with Australian water dragons.

That man was Bert Langerwerf, and the farm is Agama International Herpetocultural Institute. When Langerwerf died in 2008, his widow and their children worked hard to keep the breeding facility going. They did, but it was difficult.

Brooks has a degree in zoo animal technology, and Lauren is a licensed wildlife rehabilitator. The two got married at a wildlife sanctuary near their homes on June 27, then loaded their cars and moved to Montevallo.

""It's certainly different from what I was previously involved in,"" Lauren Brooks said. ""But I have been involved in rescuing exotics since I was 14.""

Brooks was looking for that special lizard last year, about a year after Langerwerf died. He didn't get the reptile because the farm did not have any for sale. Instead, he got about 200 lizards that came with the farm and the house and the land.

""The place needs a new coat of paint, but it's in good condition,"" Brooks said. ""We are in the process of updating it into a newer reptile farm.""

Currently four species of lizards are being bred at Agama (the scientific name for the water dragon). The premiere lizard is, of course, the Australian water dragon, which was Langerwerf's claim to international fame.

Baby crag lizards are on the way, too. ""The crag lizard is from Africa, and is uncommon in the pet trade,"" Brooks said. ""It looks kinda like a lizard that's been run over by a car; it's flat because it likes to nestle in between large rocks.

Brooks said the monkey-tailed skink is a product of Langerwerf's care.

""Agama is the largest breeder of monkey-tailed skinks in the world,"" he said. ""It's an uncommon lizard, and Agama is the only facility on record that has ever had a monkey-tailed skink give birth to triplets. Occasionally, a skink -- which gives live birth (rather than laying eggs) -- will have two babies, but Bert was able to raise skinks that had triplets.

""He was definitely doing something right,"" Brooks said.

The fourth species currently being bred at Agama is the Chinese crocodile lizard.

""It's quite endangered,"" Brooks said. ""There are only about 3,000 left in the wild.

""We are the largest breeder of this species,"" he said. ""I haven't heard of China having more than we do.""

Again, Brooks credited Langerwerf with the success of the crocodile lizard. ""Bert was one of the pioneers in their breeding,"" Brooks said. ""He wasn't the first, but he was the best.""

Brooks is honing his skills by working with two additional species, the giant Gran Canaria lizard and the Acki monitor.

Brooks said he found notes in journals kept by Langerwerf that talk about his limited work with the species discovered in the Canary Islands.

""These are barking lizards,"" Brooks said. ""They sometimes sound like a puppy barking. ""I thought they were interesting, and I think people will like them,"" he said. ""They're very friendly, and they're omnivores.""

The Acki monitor is a relative of the Komodo dragon, but it's much smaller.

It also happens to be popular among reptile aficionados, and Brooks said he is working to ensure that the species he raises are what people want to buy.

""You have to keep up with what's popular,"" he said. ""About every 10 years or so, you have to redo your stock.""

Since they're new to the business, Brooks said the website, www.agamainternational.com, is the primary method of interacting with his clients. He accepts payment through Paypal or money orders. Prices range from about $90 for a baby water dragon to about $1,000 for an adult monkey-tail skink.

Shipping a lizard takes great care in terms of packing and weather conditions. ""Before I ship anything, I check the weather,"" Brooks said. ""I don't ship when it's too hot or too cold.""

Shipping is currently limited to the continental United States, and it is handled by FedEx overnight, Brooks said. Larger lizards are shipped via Delta Dash.

On average, the lizards raised at Agama have a lifespan between 20 and 25 years with proper care. He said the reptiles he breeds and sells are harmless and make great pets.

""Nothing we raise is dangerous,"" Brooks said. ""Nothing here will hurt anyone.""

In Houston, 100 keepers are ready with solutions when signs of stress appear in a creature under their care

Novia was the Houston Zoo's no-show ocelot. Eager crowds gathered for a glimpse of the leopard-spotted South American wildcat, but she only warily eyed them from inside her den. When surprised by humans while out for a rare stroll, she darted to safety. It was a strange cat-and-mouse game that left zoo visitors disappointed.

To zookeepers, it was clear that Novia, just a year old, was one stressed kitty. Such anxiety, they knew, was bad for visitors, bad for zoos and bad for animals.

Unresolved, stress can make blue-hued banded iguanas turn black, piranhas snack on their tankmates, parrots yank out their feathers and snakes coil and rattle. No animal confined in a zoo is immune to stress, and American zoos collectively spend millions to see that it doesn't happen.

""I would argue that being in a zoo doesn't in and of itself cause stress,"" said Hollie Colahan, the Houston Zoo's curator for primates and carnivores. ""So, I think you have to look at the individual animals and their backgrounds. … Life in the wild is stressful.""

Colahan leads the zoo's enrichment committee, a body made up of animal keepers and others who try to find ways to lessen the possibility of stress. Employing the skills of Sherlock Holmes and Sigmund Freud, committee members meet monthly to take up cases like Novia's.

The zoo's 100 keepers, spokesman Brian Hill said, are the institution's first line of defense in battling animal stress. At a facility with 6,000 animals representing 800 species, keepers — also charged with feeding animals and cleaning pens - must be ever alert to stress indicators that all but the keenest eye might miss.

Novia's keepers quickly determined that the cat never had been exhibited at its previous zoo.

Working with the frightened animal to gain her trust, they gradually introduced her to the public. At first, she was brought into the exhibit area late in the afternoon, then for brief periods in the morning. Bravery was rewarded with mouse treats.

The strategy paid off within weeks as the once-skittish ocelot braved the scrutiny of zoo patrons.

Low-stress enclosures

Joining keepers in battling stress, Hill said, are zoo veterinarians and even architects. Building low-stress enclosures that mimic natural range was a key goal at the zoo's newly opened $42 million African Forest.

""It's all about prevention,"" said Hill, who noted that other exhibits were designed with the animals' natural habitats in mind.

""The eland share the exhibit with warthogs, kudu, zebras and a dorcas gazelle,"" Hill said. ""These species share the same range in the wild, so it is an appropriate and comfortable setting for them here. In fact, one of our zebras, Joplin, and our dorcas gazelle have formed such a bond that they are almost inseparable.""

Novia's stressed-out state - like those of some afflicted animals - was fairly apparent.

""With a rattlesnake, it's coiled and its tail rattles and if its tongue is out going up and down, it's telling you in every way possible, 'Please get out of here,' "" said Stan Mays, the zoo's reptile curator. ""A banded iguana, normally blue or green, will turn black if it gets upset enough. It will breathe heavily, and its heart rate will increase.""

Those are clear signs of trouble, but, for many animals, the indicators are harder to read. Keepers must not only know a species' expected behavior, but the quirks and oddities of individuals. Boas, after all, will be boas.

Does an antelope's twitching ear mean it's stressed, mad enough to fight or that it's just bothered by a fly? Is an adolescent chimpanzee's unruly behavior a sign of dangerous aggression or just immature posturing?

""Chimps are as different as people,"" Colahan said. ""It's very normal chimp behavior for them to be running around, screaming, punching and throwing. Our goal is to ensure that normal behavior doesn't cross the line to the point that it becomes harmful.""

While a human patient exhibiting symptoms of stress might be calmed by a doctor's prescription, zoo officials are reluctant to treat animals with pills.

""If my doctor puts me on a drug,"" Colahan said, ""I can tell him if I'm feeling funny or my stomach hurts. Animals can't give that kind of feedback. … We don't want to jump to fix problems with a pill right away. We'd rather get to the root of the cause, to alter the animal's environment, if necessary.""

In worst-case scenarios, animals retire to off-exhibit areas to live their lives in secluded comfort, although some were expected to return to public view.

""There are animals that never will go on exhibit,"" said Judith Bryja, reptile supervisor. ""Some do really great. Some just stress out.""

She cited the case of two banded iguanas - brothers - who were raised in an identical manner.

One, a stressed wreck after a few hours' exhibit, turned black and permanently was retired. The other became an endearing show hound.

Animals that exhibit signs of stress first are checked by veterinarians to rule out sickness, zoo officials said.

""When we wonder if they're just crazy, we have them checked for underlying medical conditions,"" said bird curator Hannah Bailey. Thus, doctors determined that the odd foot pecking of the zoo's green jays had a medical cause.

Enriching surroundings

Much of the wisdom of enriching zoo environments came as an outgrowth of research by members of the National Association of Zoos and Aquariums. ""Enrichment can mean a lot of things,"" AZA spokesman Steve Feldman said. ""It can be putting scent in the big cat enclosure or providing places for fishes to hide.""

At Houston Zoo's new African Forest, keepers start the morning scattering food throughout the chimp habitat to stimulate the animals' instinct for foraging.

For birds, reducing stress can be as basic as providing the right-size cage, one that allows for flight, and strategic plantings and perches.

At the aquarium, enrichment takes the form of tanks that, equipped with fake tree trunks or coral reefs, mimic the natural environment.

The problematic behavior of piranhas is an ongoing area of inquiry for Colahan's enrichment committee. The panel has compiled a list of positive piranha traits, which they try to encourage, and nastier behaviors that should be discouraged.

Among the latter is a tendency to eat their tankmates.

""We try by proper food selection, proper nutrients, proper amounts to cut down on their aggressiveness,"" aquarium curator George Brandy said. ""They are predators. They eat other fish. They are known to cannibalize.""

Keepers on the enrichment committee also are exploring mysterious piranha behavior - the ability to vibrate and make clicking noises and their apparent attraction to Aggie maroon clothing worn by their keepers.

""That color of clothing thing,"" said Brandy, ""is just a hypothesis.""",Houston Zoo takes action when animals get stressed,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdXN0b24tdGV4YXMvYXJ0aWNsZS9Ib3VzdG9uLVpvby10YWtlcy1hY3Rpb24td2hlbi1hbmltYWxzLWdldC1zdHJlc3NlZC0xNjg4NjkwLnBocNIBa2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNocm9uLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdXN0b24tdGV4YXMvYW1wL0hvdXN0b24tWm9vLXRha2VzLWFjdGlvbi13aGVuLWFuaW1hbHMtZ2V0LXN0cmVzc2VkLTE2ODg2OTAucGhw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://s.hdnux.com/photos/04/50/61/1215605/3/rawImage.jpg,2011-08-01,"{'sent': 'Houston Zoo takes action when animals get stressed For animals, it can be a jungle at the zoo\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Houston Zoo']}}",Chinese Crocodile Lizard
0,"Kolkata : Fifteen Indian bird species are part of a list of avians which are evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered.

The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and Yale University has come out with a study of 100 Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species worldwide.

The study says Bengal Florican, Lesser Florican, Great Indian Bustard, Sociable Lapwing and Jerdon’s Courser are birds that are under threat due to the destruction of their habitat of grasslands and scrub forests.

The survival of Spoon-billed Sandpiper, Siberian Crane and White-bellied Heron greatly depend on the existence of their wetland habitat. Forest Owlet’s survival is impossible if its habitat of deciduous forests in central India is destroyed, the study said.

Officials of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), which works on the conservation of 12 of these threatened birds, said these species were threatened by human factors such as uncontrolled urbanisation, unsustainable industrialisation and rampant use of chemicals in agriculture.

“Comprehensive conservation action based on in-depth field research is required to save these species from going extinct. Today these habitats are facing some of the most severe human pressure, which endanger the survival of the avian population found there,"" BNHS director Asad Rahmani said.

Habitats such as grasslands and wetlands and the species inhabiting them have long been neglected in the conservation process in India, he added.

Bittu Sahgal, editor, Sanctuary Asia, said birds such as the Bengal Florican, Great Indian Bustard and Jerdon’s Courser are as vital to the health of grasslands as the tiger is to the forests in which it is found.

“India has displayed little regard for its grasslands these past decades and it is about time the nation stopped treating these life-saving ecosystems as wastelands"", Sahgal, also an environmental activist said.

0,"Entire branches of the tree of life are in danger of being wiped out: The majority of species in some groups of plants and animals are now on the ""Red List"" of the world's most threatened species.

The list, which is managed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and was updated this week, shows that among the groups most at risk are lemurs and temperate slipper orchids.

Found only in Madagascar, 90 of the 101 species of lemur are threatened with extinction, the IUCN said. More than 20 percent of these small primates are listed as being critically endangered, meaning that they have a very high risk of extinction in the wild. The main threat stems from illegal logging of tropical forests, which has accelerated in the island nation in recent years. (See video: ""The Smallest Lemur."")

View Images The large-bodied indri—the largest species of lemur—is classified by the IUCN as critically endangered. PHOTOGRAPH BY NICK GARBUTT

Temperate slipper orchids, whose slipper-shaped flowers make them a popular ornamental plant, face a similar fate, with 79 percent of species threatened with extinction, according to the IUCN. The flowers are found across North America, Europe, and Asia and are at risk because of habitat destruction and overcollection. (See: ""Orchid flowers fool flat-footed flies by faking fungus-infected foliage."")

View Images The California lady's slipper, found only in California and Oregon, is classified by the IUCN as endangered. PHOTOGRAPH BY BILL BOUTON

""What was most surprising about this assessment was the degree of threat to these orchids,"" said Hassan Rankou, the IUCN Species Survival Commission's Red List Authority for the Orchid Specialist Group, which is hosted by the U.K.'s Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.

""Although the industry is sustained by cultivated stock,"" he said, referring to the trade in orchids, ""conservation of wild species is vital for its future."" (See National Geographic's photos of orchids.)

In its latest update, the IUCN added a number of new species to its Red List and reassessed the conservation status of many species placed there years ago.

Five notable examples:

1. Japanese Eel

View Images The Japanese eel, the most expensive fish on the menu in Japan, is classified as endangered. PHOTOGRAPH BY YUICHI KANO

The Japanese eel was added to the IUCN's list with an endangered classification, meaning it has a high risk of extinction.

A delicacy in Japan, this commercially lucrative fish has been hard hit by a combination of overfishing, habitat loss, pollution, and changes in ocean currents. (See ""Mystery Travelers"" to learn more about eels.)

""While the status of this species is of great concern, the assessment of the Japanese eel and other eels is a hugely positive step,"" says Matthew Gollock, chair of the IUCN Anguillid Specialist Sub-Group.

""This information will allow us to prioritize conservation efforts for eel species and the freshwater ecosystem more broadly.""

2. Brazilian Three-Banded Armadillo

The Brazilian three-banded armadillo—currently serving as the 2014 FIFA World Cup mascot—was reassessed by the IUCN team and remains vulnerable, meaning it has a high risk of becoming endangered.

The species has declined an estimated 30 percent in the past 10 to 15 years, primarily because of extensive conversion of its habitat in Brazil to sugarcane and soybean plantations.

3. Chinese Crocodile Lizard

The Chinese crocodile lizard, found only in China and Vietnam, was newly classified as endangered because the species is thought to have declined by 84 percent from 1978 to 2008 and only a few isolated populations remain.

One of the primary threats to the species comes from illegal hunting for the international pet trade, with habitat loss being an additional factor. (See ""The Kingpin"" to learn more about Asia's wildlife trade.)

4. Banana Orchid

The banana orchid, another new addition to the IUCN Red List and the national flower of the Cayman Islands, was classified as endangered because it is currently losing habitat at a rapid rate.

The dry forests and shrublands where it lives are being cleared to make way for housing and tourism development, and—unless conservation measures are taken—it is likely to lose 50 percent of its habitat within the next century.

5. Yarkon Bream

View Images The Yarkon bream, found only in Israel, went from being extinct in the wild to vulnerable, according to the IUCN. PHOTOGRAPH BY MENACHEM GOREN

Not all of the changes to the Red List were negative, however. The Yarkon bream, a fish found in Israel, stands out as a conservation success story. The species jumped multiple levels on the IUCN classification system, going from extinct in the wild to vulnerable.

The Yarkon bream disappeared from the wild in 1999 after the only remaining individuals (120 of them) were saved from a riverbed that was drying up due to drought.

0,"STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Do you know what a Patagonian cavy is?

How about a cassowary? A Chinese crocodile lizard?

Perhaps not, but there's no need to fret.

For future zoologists and passive onlookers alike, the Staten Island Zoo's long list of recent acquisitions have skipped over the traditional (lions, tigers, and bears) and instead included more obscure species.

The result, the West Brighton zoo hopes, is a far more memorable, mysterious, and informative visit than the average person's forage into wildlife.

One highlight occurred just two weeks ago when the zoo welcomed a pair of Patagonian cavies -- Cael and Caela.

The infants currently reside in the facility's nursery.

The furry siblings belong to a relatively unheard of species, one whose members possess rabbit-like characteristics but are a part of the rodent family.

And the ""near-endangered"" species indigenous to Argentina is drawing curious eyes to the zoo's collection.



Among other new residents are a leaf-tailed gecko, a Chinese crocodile lizard, a bearcat, a handful of pigs, and a couple of ostriches.

Other recent additions include two joeys, named Foster and Nugget.

In all, the zoo's population has nearly doubled in under three years and the eight- acre location now plays home to more than 1,500 animals.

The zoo's general curator and veterinarian, Dr. Marc Valitutto, is confident that the recent quirky additions to the collection are drawing more eyes to the zoo and helping build its reputation.

""Other zoos have their niche animals, like lions, tigers and bears,"" he said. ""Here, we are capitalizing on different species that are going to wow visitors.""

His efforts as curator have helped the zoo explore new species, program a summer series and even utilize new methods of bringing them to the Staten Island Zoo.

One example is the recent acquisition of a cassowary: a flightless bird, whose species is native to the South Pacific.

To fund the purchase, the zoo set up a special fund on IndieGogo, a crowdsourcing website.

Thanks to the generosity of donors, a cassowary arrived two weeks ago, making the Staten Island Zoo the only zoo in the Northeast to play home to the species.

The crowdsourcing effort underscores the zoo's mission to conserve species whose numbers are shrinking, all while educating the local community about endangered species and our responsibility to protect them.

As for its next acquisition, the zoo will be opening its gates to an Arctic fox, set to arrive within the next few days.

This article is more than 5 years old

This article is more than 5 years old

Porcupines in cages, endangered tortoises in buckets and snakes in cloth bags are among the rare wildlife on open sale at a Chinese market, despite courts being ordered to jail those who eat endangered species.

The diners of southern China have long had a reputation for exotic tastes, with locals sometimes boasting they will ""eat anything with four legs except a table"".

China in April raised the maximum sentence for anyone caught selling or consuming endangered species to 10 years in prison, but lax enforcement is still evident in the province of Guangdong.

""I can sell the meat for 500 yuan ($80) per half kilo,"" a pangolin vendor at the Xingfu - ""happy and rich"" - wholesale market in Conghua told AFP. ""If you want a living one it will be more than 1,000 yuan.""

The market was the subject of a Chinese media expose two years ago, when a local official told the state-run Beijing Technology Times that its role as a centre for animal trafficking was an ""open secret"".

The seller, who declined to be named, said making a living from his creatures was getting tougher. ""Now it's governed very strictly,"" he said.

But on a recent morning traders were out in force, with hundreds of snakes writhing in white cloth bags and wild boars staring plaintively from wire cages.

Not all the produce is illegal but a huge sign touted giant salamanders, which are classed as critically endangered - one level below ""extinct in the wild"" - on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List of threatened species.

Asian yellow pond turtles were up for sale beside porcupines, most likely from Asia where several species are also critically endangered.

Southern China has long been the centre of a culinary tradition called ""wild flavour"", which prizes parts of unusual wild animals including tigers, turtles and snakes as a route to health - despite the lack of orthodox scientific evidence proving such benefits exist.

Pangolins - scaly creatures which in the wild lick up ants with tongues longer than their bodies - are protected by the international wildlife trade treaty CITES, to which Beijing is a signatory.

But in parts of China they are prized by new mothers hoping to produce milk, and have become the focus of a vast smuggling industry stretching across Southeast Asia - estimated to traffic tens of thousands of the animals each year.

Beijing first enacted laws in 1989 forbidding trade in scores of creatures including the Chinese pangolin, but has long struggled to enforce the ban as a booming economy has boosted demand.

In April the country's rubber-stamp parliament approved a new interpretation of the 1980s law which could see jail sentences of up to 10 years for those caught eating endangered animals, as well as for sellers.

Meanwhile, state-run media have publicised huge hauls of smuggled animals - with border police in Guangdong province in May shown seizing 956 frozen pangolins, reportedly weighing four tonnes.

Jill Robertson, CEO of Hong Kong-based charity Animals Asia, described the enhanced penalties as a ""positive step"" but added that ""enforcement must be strengthened, and public education and awareness greatly enhanced"".

""The illegal wildlife trade in general has become a multi-billion dollar business in China,"" she said.

But there are signs the threats and increased penalties are having an effect.

Last year a chef surnamed Wang told AFP that his restaurant sold pangolin for 2,000 yuan per half kilo, adding: ""We usually braise them, cook it in a stew or make soup, but braising in soy sauce tastes best.""

But when AFP recently contacted around a dozen restaurants specialising in ""wild flavour"" none admitted to selling the meat.

But Tian Yangyang, a researcher for Chinese advocacy group Nature University, pointed out that Guangdong eateries do not generally advertise endangered species but offer them to trusted customers on secret menus.



Last year he sneaked into Guangdong restaurants where he found that eagle and swan were widely available.

""I am not optimistic the the rules will be enforced, because the legal system in China is still not very robust,"" he said, adding that the trade in protected animals ""is getting worse, because it has been driven underground"".

For other species, trade is unabated, and at a Guangzhou roadside establishment specialising in snake stew, live king cobras in cages were bestsellers.

The animals are classified as ""vulnerable"" on the Red List due to habitat loss and ""over-exploitation for medicinal purposes"".

""Eating this kind of snake is good for the throat and head,"" said a 17-year-old customer surnamed Wang, as white-hatted chefs decapitated and sliced them up behind a transparent plastic screen.

""I didn't know they were endangered,"" she added, before tucking in enthusiastically.",Pangolin and porcupines on sale in Chinese market despite jail threat,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDE0L2p1bC8wNy9wYW5nb2xpbi1hbmQtcG9yY3VwaW5lcy1vbi1zYWxlLWluLWNoaW5lc2UtbWFya2V0LWRlc3BpdGUtamFpbC10aHJlYXTSAXlodHRwczovL2FtcC50aGVndWFyZGlhbi5jb20vZW52aXJvbm1lbnQvMjAxNC9qdWwvMDcvcGFuZ29saW4tYW5kLXBvcmN1cGluZXMtb24tc2FsZS1pbi1jaGluZXNlLW1hcmtldC1kZXNwaXRlLWphaWwtdGhyZWF0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/7/7/1404723651153/9e0a6f59-ae0b-49fb-a88c-3a2787f7d3cd-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=775da8b988f4f3c2793136325f809031,2014-07-07,"{'sent': 'The diners of southern China have long had a reputation for exotic tastes, with locals sometimes boasting they will ""eat anything with four legs except a table"".\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China'], 'CARDINAL': ['four']}}",Pangolin

The largest amphibian in the UK is settling in to his new home at the London Zoo.

Chinese giant salamander Professor Wu arrived at the Zoological Society London Zoo (ZSL) at the end of last month from Rotterdam Zoo.

The 19-year-old has been brought over for a new conservation project to help research ways to prevent the giants from becoming extinct in the wild and was named after one of the project’s partners.

Professor Wu is the only Chinese giant salamander in the UK and can be seen in the Land of Giants exhibit at the zoo.

The animals are classified as the world’s largest amphibian and face threat of extinction because they are being over-harvested for human consumption.

Ben Tapley, team leader of the reptile and amphibian team, said: “Chinese giant salamanders may not be everyone’s idea of ‘beautiful’, but we think Professor Wu is more than capable of winning over our visitors.

“He’s an impressive size, measuring 1.3metres from snout to tail, and on top of that he has a feisty personality – it took a team of four of us to move him to his new custom-built home.

“As well as an exciting new arrival here at the Zoo, this giant salamander is a great representative for our ground breaking conservation project in China, where we really want to turn the fate of this critically endangered and evolutionary distinct species around.”",London Zoo gets a new star... a giant Chinese Salamander called Professor Wu,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YW5kYXJkLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvbG9uZG9uL2xvbmRvbi16b28tZ2V0cy1hLW5ldy1zdGFyLWEtZ2lhbnQtY2hpbmVzZS1zYWxhbWFuZGVyLWNhbGxlZC1wcm9mZXNzb3Itd3UtOTkyODMwNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/12/16/12/salamander.jpg,2014-12-16,"{'sent': 'ES News email', 'ents': {'ORG': ['ES News']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"With his tiny eyes, sly grin, and slimy skin, Professor Wu may sound like an odd poster child.

But the Chinese giant salamander, which recently arrived at the Zoological Society of London's London Zoo, is the face of a new effort to save the world's largest amphibians by, in part, working with China's salamander farmers to discourage hunting and establishing a breeding facility in the country.

Habitat destruction and a Chinese appetite for the creatures has led to an 80 percent decline in their numbers in recent decades, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists them as critically endangered.

The 19-year-old Professor Wu—named after one of the conservation project's partners in China—is the only Chinese giant salamander in the U.K. (Watch video: ""Giant Salamanders Helped to Spawn."")

""He's an impressive size, measuring 1.3 meters [4.3 feet] from snout to tail, and on top of that he has a feisty personality—it took a team of four of us to move him to his new custom-built home,"" Ben Tapley, team leader of the zoo's reptile and amphibian team, said in a statement.

""As well as an exciting arrival here at the zoo, this giant salamander is a great representative for our groundbreaking conservation project in China,"" Tapley said, ""where we really want to turn the fate of this critically endangered and evolutionary distinct species around.""

Big Trouble

As part of the project, the zoo and its partners are surveying people in China about what they believe are threats to the salamander. This on-the-ground input may provide information for conservationists to make sound decisions about helping the amphibian.

The team is also analyzing the genes of various salamander populations and comparing them to determine how they're related, which will help conservationists prioritize.

The zoo is working with commercial salamander farmers to both reduce disease on the farms and prevent wild salamanders from being harvested. Most Chinese giant salamanders are thought to come from the wild—China does not regulate their hunting.

The project hopes to establish a new breeding facility in China to raise Chinese giant salamanders that could eventually be released into the wild. (See ""Rare Giant Salamanders Bred in Captivity."")

Professor Wu obviously won't play a direct role in such activities, but the London Zoo hopes he will get visitors to think about the Chinese giant salamander's rapid decline in the wild.

Easy Targets

Scientists aren't sure how many Chinese giant salamanders still exist in the wild, where the animal inhabits fast-flowing streams and mountain lakes, feeding on fish and crustaceans.

There are two other species of giant salamander, the Japanese giant salamander and the United States' hellbender, both of which are designated as near threatened by the IUCN. (Related: ""U.S. Giant Salamanders Slipping Away: Inside the Fight to Save the Hellbender."")

Chinese giant salamanders are overharvested for food in part because they're easy to capture: They hide in rock crevasses and can be easily snagged by hunters.

The species reproduces slowly, taking an estimated 15 years to reach breeding age.

What's more, much of its Chinese habitat has been developed or destroyed—""one of the most significant threats this species faces,"" said Jessi Krebs, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Nebraska. (Read about vanishing amphibians in National Geographic magazine.)

""The damming of rivers and streams for flood control and farming makes the habitat unusable for the salamanders.""

0,"AsianScientist (Mar. 20, 2015) – New research published in Oryx shows that Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) farms risk the extinction of wild salamander populations instead of supporting their conservation.

Researchers from the Shaanxi Normal University and Zoological Society of London (ZSL) surveyed 43 farms in China and worked with the Shaanxi Province Fisheries Office to investigate the Chinese giant salamander farming industry. They found that, although only a decade old, the industry houses millions of animals and is a major contributor to the Chinese rural economy. The farming industry however, poses a number of threats to the Chinese giant salamander, but also has potential to benefit the species.

Wild salamanders are illegally poached to supplement farmed populations which often do not breed successfully. Farmed salamanders are traded across China and are kept in crowded conditions, both of which promote devastating disease outbreaks. Untreated wastewater from farms is discharged into local river systems, potentially spreading diseases to wild populations.

The Chinese giant salamander trade mixes locally-adapted genetic strains, making farmed animals unsuitable for future reintroduction to the wild.

Professor Andrew Cunningham, Professor of Wildlife Epidemiology at ZSL and lead-author of the paper, said: “The findings from our study identify measures that need to be taken to ensure the sustainability of Chinese giant salamander farming while also reducing threats to the remaining animals in the wild. With better farming practices, the Chinese giant salamander farming industry has the potential to benefit, rather than threaten, their conservation.”

Chinese giant salamanders, the world’s largest amphibian, are eaten as a delicacy in China. Their numbers have declined catastrophically over the past 30 years, largely due to overexploitation for food and habitat destruction. A rapidly growing number of farms, which supply salamanders for the restaurant trade, could be putting the future of this Critically Endangered species at risk.

Co-author Dr. Samuel Turvey, Senior Research Fellow at ZSL, said: “We recommend complete separation of farmed and wild salamander populations, supported by the enforcement of existing legislation to stop the continued capture of wild individuals. Improved farming methods are required to remove any need to poach wild individuals, reduce disease risks to both farmed and wild salamanders, and to prevent genetic pollution of the wild salamanders.”

Chinese giant salamanders are categorised as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to a drastic 80 percent decline in population over the last 30 years. This Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered (EDGE) species has been recognized as the number one priority for international amphibian conservation.

ZSL London Zoo is home to the UK’s only Chinese giant salamander. Named after a project partner in China, 19 year-old Professor Wu measures over one metre in length and arrived in London at the end of November.

0,"A park ranger in south China was surprised to find a giant salamander while he was out picking winkles. The giant amphibian measures 83 cm in length (2.5 feet) and weighs 5.5 kg (12 pounds). This amazing creature has remained relatively unchanged since the Jurassic and is widely regarded as a living fossil, but at the moment it is critically endangered. After keeping it temporarily and measuring it, he released it back into the wild.

Despite its status as an endangered species, the giant salamander is regarded as a delicacy among China’s rich elite. Earlier this year Chinese officials were investigated for reportedly eating a giant salamander at a luxury banquet in Shenzhen. Fortunately though, a recent government crackdown ensured that anyone found to be eating endangered species could receive a jail sentence of up to ten years. It remains to be seen if this measure will actually be enforced. Many believe it to have medicinal properties, although there is no scientific evidence to back this up (like many beliefs in traditional Chinese medicine).

Giant salamanders are part of a family called Cryptobranchidae. They are the largest amphibians living today, reaching a length of 1.8 m (5.9 ft). Interestingly enough, in 1726, the Swiss physician Johann Jakob Scheuchzer described a fossil as Homo diluvii testis (Latin: Evidence of a diluvian human), believing it to be the remains of a human being who drowned in the biblical flood. In 1812, the fossil was examined by Georges Cuvier, who recognized that it was not human and properly identified it as a salamander.

There is currently one species found in the US, while Asian species are found both in China and Japan. The Chinese giant salamander eats aquatic insects, fish, frogs, crabs, and shrimp, hunting mostly at night. The giant salamander holds a treasured place in Chinese mythology and is called ‘wa wa yu’ – or ‘baby fish’ – in Chinese because its distress call sounds like the cry of a baby.","Chinese Park Ranger Finds Rare, Giant Salamander",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnptZXNjaWVuY2UuY29tL2Vjb2xvZ3kvYW5pbWFscy1lY29sb2d5L2NoaW5lc2UtcmFuZ2VyLWdpYW50LXNhbGFtYW5kZXItMjQwMzIwMTUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuem1lc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vZWNvbG9neS9hbmltYWxzLWVjb2xvZ3kvY2hpbmVzZS1yYW5nZXItZ2lhbnQtc2FsYW1hbmRlci0yNDAzMjAxNS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/26EC53D400000578-0-image-a-17_1427132113675.jpg,2015-03-24,"{'sent': 'A park ranger in south China was surprised to find a giant salamander while he was out picking winkles.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

Bengal Florican, declared a critically endangered bird species by the IUCN had their primary habitats across the subcontinent, including Nepal, Bhutan, India, Bangladesh and sporadic populations reported from South China and SE Asia. Unfortunately, severe habitat encroachments by the exploding human populations in the subcontinent as well as in the SE Asia; and their heavy dependence on forest resources for daily sustenance have wiped out the populations of this majestic species drastically. The species is believed to be already extinct in the wild in South China, Bangladesh and Myanmar due to relentless hunting, habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation. The largest wild populations are now reported only from East (eastern UP, Bihar, Jharkhand & WB) and North East (Assam and Arunachal Pradesh) India and along the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan borders; and a separate population is reported from the Indo-China region (Cambodia and Vietnam). By far, India and Bhutan appears to be the last safe refuge of this beautiful species due to successful conservation initiatives by the regional governments and local dedicated NGOs. Although seen quite frequently in the past in the foothill regions of Nepal bordering India; the sightings has turned to almost nil in the past decade. It would be extremely unfortunate to find the species extinct in the wild in Nepal. I request the wildlife authorities and avian enthusiasts of Nepal to come forward in establishing a captive breeding program for Bengal Florican for successful multiplication of this critically endangered species and introducing them back to their wild habitats in the foothills of Nepal. Other subcontinent nations have been successful in the reintroduction of the species, and Nepal could do too if we all come forward to save this majestic species.

No excuse

It is always the general people hardest hit and compelled to bear the brunt of the cheating mentality of business community when crisis befalls in the country. Since the unofficial blockade imposed by India on the supply of petroleum products Nepali business communities are making excuse of an acute shortage of daily commodities. With the excuses, black marketing is on the rise despite the fact that the government had already directed its concerned agencies to strictly monitor the malpractices around the festive season. Shopkeepers both in the cities and the remote parts of the country are overcharging for the supply of daily commodities. Just yesterday, I was forced to pay Rs. 160 for a liter of cooking oil for which, earlier, I used to pay Rs. 120 though I had warned the shopkeeper of reporting to the concerned authorities for overcharging. Individuals like me have no other option than to pay the amount.

Concerned authorities should understand that this is not the case with me alone. There are tens of thousands people like me facing the same difficulties to afford the commodities for daily use.

0,"The Chinese Giant Salamander can grow to as much as a meter in length, but it is a mysterious and enigmatic creature threatened by over-exploitation, disease, and habitat loss.

Millions are being raised on farms, but the vast majority of breeding stock for those farms are either wild-caught, or first generation offspring of wild-caught animals. The wild salamander’s extinction would also likely spell doom for the farming industry.

Conservation programs are underway to save wild Chinese Giant Salamanders, and along with them, the remaining watersheds and wild river habitats in which they live.

The world’s largest amphibian sounds like a work of fiction: virtually unchanged since the time of the dinosaurs, and reportedly growing as long as a man, the Chinese Giant Salamander (Andrias davidianus) is clinging to survival in the wild in a few fast-flowing rivers scattered across the highlands of China. Meanwhile, the aquaculture industry is breeding the animal in large numbers in captivity for the gourmet food market.

The Chinese Giant Salamander is a fully aquatic amphibian that grows to a maximum length of 1.8 meters (almost 6 feet). More typically measuring about 1 meter (3.28 feet), it breathes through its mottled brown, rough, wrinkled skin, and has a broad, flat head, and tiny eyes. Poor eyesight means that this large animal relies heavily on smell, touch, and the sensing of vibrations — via special sensory nodes in its skin — to catch prey of fish, frogs, and insects.

Females lay strings of hundreds of eggs in dens, or underwater cavities, which are then guarded by male den masters until the eggs hatch a couple of months later. Measuring just 3 centimeters (1.18 inches) long when they emerge from the egg, the salamanders grow slowly to their adult size, reaching sexual maturity when they are about 15 years old.

An ancient animal disappearing from wild rivers

Part of a lineage stretching back 170 million years, these ancient creatures are “living fossils” now at risk of extinction in the wild due to a deadly combination of over-exploitation, disease, and habitat loss. Long generation times make recovery difficult, and a catastrophic population decline of more than 80% in just a few decades has resulted in the species being classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN. The Zoological Society of London’s EDGE (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) project has placed the salamander at number two on its amphibian risk list.

The perilous status of the species in the wild stands in sharp contrast to the millions of captive Chinese Giant Salamanders that abound in the country: a highly valued dietary delicacy, the salamanders are farmed on an industrial scale.

“Chinese Giant Salamanders have been in decline for decades but the recent growth of the farming industry and the knock-on impacts this creates means we have now reached a critical point in terms of the persistence of this species in the wild,” Ben Tapley, head of the reptile team at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), told mongabay.com.

To boost conservation action on the species, the Chinese Giant Salamander Conservation project was launched in 2012. This ZSL-led effort is being conducted in conjunction with the Chinese government and other Chinese institutions including the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Shaanxi Normal University, and Guiyang University.

The multi-faceted project combines habitat surveys and genetic and pathogen sampling of wild salamanders, along with sampling at salamander farms, to investigate both the status of the species in the wild, and the effect that captive populations have on their wild counterparts. Raising awareness of the species within China and building national capacity for conservation are also key activities of the project.

An enigmatic, charismatic amphibian

Relatively little is known about the salamander — currently estimated to number fewer than 50,000 wild individuals. Its range once extended across much of southern and central China, but today is highly fragmented. To assess its current distribution, the project is focusing on key areas which have the best chance of being home to the species.

“The Chinese Giant Salamander [CGS] team developed a habitat niche model for the CGS, and from this selected 100 sites representing optimal habitats for the species,” Tapley explained. “At each of the 100 sites, we carry out ecological surveys where a variety of methods including trapping, rock turning, nocturnal snorkelling and spotlighting surveys are used to locate wild salamanders. Any salamanders that are caught are marked, weighed, measured — with genetic and pathogen samples also being taken.”

The surveys will allow the team to map the salamander’s current range distribution, a critical step towards designing effective protected areas to conserve the species in the wild.

Tapley has been interested in amphibians since childhood, and the project offers him the opportunity to work with a species that has long captured his imagination. “Chinese Giant Salamanders have always fascinated me,” he said. “I’m unashamedly in awe of these animals, and the fact they’ve effectively remained unchanged in evolutionary terms since the time of the dinosaurs.”

The species has also captured the imagination of the Chinese people throughout history. “The species is culturally significant,” Tapley said. “It’s actually believed that the Taoist yin and yang symbol was inspired by the image of two entwined giant salamanders and the species has appeared in ancient Chinese artworks.”

The team’s survey — the largest in China’s conservation history — has revealed far fewer salamanders than expected. “The biggest surprise for me has been just how few wild salamanders we’ve encountered to date,” Tapley said. “I’ve worked with a number of Critically Endangered amphibians in the past, but in most cases we’ve been able to locate the target species with relative ease. The CGS, by contrast, can be surprisingly elusive for a creature of its size.”

For Tapley, a highlight of working on the project was his first encounter with a wild salamander. “My most memorable moment was coming face-to-face with a wild CGS for the first time. We’d been conducting surveys at a beautiful site in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve but had failed to find any salamanders during any of our previous visits. On this particular morning, we were all feeling pretty cold, tired and not hugely optimistic. This was until we checked our humane traps and, to our delight, found that the last one contained an adult male CGS! The moment was made even more special because many of our Chinese team members had never seen a wild CGS before, either, despite countless hours spent searching. Moments like this make all the hard work extremely worthwhile and seeing this amazing creature in the wild made us all more determined to conserve this fantastic species.

Becky Shu Chen, project manager of the Chinese Giant Salamander project, revealed just how few and far between their encounters with the species have been. “Surprisingly, we only detected [the] presence of wild CGS in 5 sites out of 90 survey sites so far.”

“Our experience makes it clear that populations, where they still exist, are often at extremely low density and that even where individuals persist, the population may be functionally extinct,” Tapley commented.

China’s hunger for giant salamanders

Habitat loss is one factor in the species’ decline. “China is developing at such a rate that habitats, especially river systems, are being dramatically altered through sedimentation, dam construction and road construction. CGS have very specific habitat requirements and the extent of the remaining suitable habitat for the species is shrinking constantly,” Tapley explained.

But it is the salamander’s exploitation for food that is the critical issue at present, with wild populations plundered to keep farm populations viable. Although a self-sustaining farmed population could be beneficial for the species, current practices rely on wild individuals to boost farm stocks. The industry is still in its infancy, and farms have struggled to successfully maintain captive populations, resulting in the vast majority of breeding individuals being either wild-caught, or first generation offspring of wild-caught animals. As things stand, therefore, the extinction of the salamander in the wild would also spell the end of the farming industry. But even if a self-sustaining farmed population could be maintained, the loss of these unique animals from the wild would be a tragedy for Chinese, and global, biodiversity. And over time, selective breeding on farms could change the salamander’s physical and behavioral characteristics so that they differed from those of their wild ancestors.

Furthermore, diseases originating on farms can spread to wild populations, and well-intentioned releases from farms to supposedly boost wild populations are rife with problems. Released animals may carry disease, and may also be more closely related to populations that exist far from the site of their release. This can lead to a loss of genetic diversity within the species as a whole, as individuals from different populations are brought together. A genetically diverse population has a good chance of responding to future events such as climate change that may affect the species’ survival; genetic homogenization reduces these chances.

“The scale of the farming industry in China is staggering — a 2011 census purely looking at the licensed farms in Shaanxi Province showed that there were 2.6 million CGS on farms, and the industry has expanded massively since then,” said Tapley. “Diseases such as ranavirus are a problem on some of the farms, and effluent from these facilities often flows directly into neighboring river systems.”

“The biggest challenge to the conservation of the CGS is the sustainability of the farming industry. We recognise that it’s an important economic activity for many Chinese, but there are many changes that could be made to minimise the industry’s impact on remaining wild salamanders,” Tapley said. “Farmed and wild CGS populations should be kept completely separate and biosecurity measures improved.”

Outreach and education key

Reaching out to farms to develop more sustainable practices is part of a wide range of communication and outreach activities that Chen has been leading. “We have been working closely with communities, especially in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve in Guizhou Province. We organized stakeholder meetings to engage farms for more sustainable management, and surveyed communities for their willingness to be involved in the development of wildlife ecotourism in Fanjingshan,” said Chen.

“We have also been successfully promoting the plight of this species [with a] top-table discussion with the royalty,” of Great Britain. Prince William was introduced to the project on a visit to China earlier this year, Chen added. The project has also conducted vigorous “on-the-ground conservation campaigns in rural marginal communities.”

An educational campaign called Go for Salamander has been developed, and a children’s book published, with 5,000 copies distributed to schools in Guizhou province.

Outreach events have spread the message even further. “Local campaigns in Guizhou have reached more than 1,000 people, and joint campaigns with museums and science centers in Yunnan and Guangxi province have reached an estimated 10,000 people,” Chen said. “We did pre- and post-campaign evaluations, and the results showed a significant increase of people’s knowledge about CGS and more positive attitudes to its conservation.”

The survival of the Chinese Giant Salamander depends on a concerted effort at the national level to build capacity for conserving this unique species. “To date, we have trained over 80 people in our survey methodologies, and have also supported Chinese conservation biologists through our EDGE Fellowship program,” Tapley said. “The program aims to create a new global network of in-country conservationists trained in cutting-edge wildlife management techniques and equipped to design and implement projects for local EDGE species.”

It’s not just farmers, conservationists, and policymakers who have valuable roles to play: those consuming salamander meat can influence the farming industry. ”There’s a growing trend towards more ethical consumption within China, and one of the best things consumers can do is ensure they’re only buying responsibly-sourced and certified-sustainable CGS meat and other products,” Tapley explained. “From a more global perspective, greater financial support for CGS conservation efforts will help ramp-up efforts on the ground.”

Tapley is optimistic about the salamander’s future, seeing viable solutions to offset the factors threatening its survival. “Even though the current situation is still dire, we’re now in a position where we can work with partners to secure a more sustainable future for the species,” he said. “The farming industry is important, but can be made more sustainable; management of protected areas can be improved; laws can be more strongly enforced; and habitats can be restored. We’ve already succeeded in reaching out to people and attracting them to our cause, and I firmly believe that where there’s a will to protect this species, there’s a way.”

China has the opportunity to not only embrace this charismatic and emblematic species, but to reap the benefits that conserving it would bring. “The CGS has been dubbed the ‘fresh water panda’ and as the country’s most iconic aquatic species, it should be recognised more widely as a national treasure,” Tapley concluded. “If we protect the salamanders and the habitats in which they occur, we can also protect the myriad of other species living in these rich ecosystems. Watershed protection has a huge direct benefit to humans. It is important that we recognise that what is good for the CGS is often good for people, too!”","Chinese Giant Salamander: millions farmed, nearly extinct in the wild",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxNS8xMS9jaGluZXNlLWdpYW50LXNhbGFtYW5kZXItbWlsbGlvbnMtZmFybWVkLW5lYXJseS1leHRpbmN0LWluLXRoZS13aWxkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2015/11/03051755/FEATURED-cgs-469x330.jpg,2015-11-13,"{'sent': 'Millions are being raised on farms, but the vast majority of breeding stock for those farms are either wild-caught, or first generation offspring of wild-caught animals.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['Millions']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

The 4ft 7in amphibious beast, weighing in at about 114 lbs, was stumbled upon going about its business recently in a cave in Chongqing according to People's Daily Online.

An eye-popping video released to Chinese media shows the rubbery brown monster then being examined by wildlife experts having transferred it to a local research facility for further study.

Giant salamanders, adjudged to be 'critically endangered' by the Zoological Society of London, are the largest species of amphibian in the world, growing up to 6ft in length.

Having been around for over 170 million years, they are also one of the oldest species on the planet, having co-existed with several species of dinosaurs but have suffered from a huge dip in population over the past thirty years with human consumption the major cause of this decline.

The Chinese giant salamander is considered to be a luxury food item in the country as well as an important source of traditional medicines, in spite of its rarity.

As they are slow and easy to hunt, catching the salamanders in nets is not a problem for Chinese poachers and they have been killed in droves - although they are now a protected species in China.

The creatures tend to be most commonly found in rocky mountain streams and lakes with clear fast-running water, and are known to dine on crabs, lobsters and large fish.

The giant salamander holds a treasured place in Chinese mythology and has been nick-named 'wa wa yu' - or 'baby fish' - in Chinese because its distress call is said to sound like the cry of a baby.

The skin of the water-dwelling creature has been long said to have anti-ageing benefits for humans, although there is no scientific evidence whatsoever to support this claim.",Giant salamander measuring 4ft 7in discovered in remote cave in China,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9wZW9wbGVzZGFpbHkvYXJ0aWNsZS0zMzU1OTY5L0dpYW50LXNhbGFtYW5kZXItbWVhc3VyaW5nLTRmdC03aW4tZGlzY292ZXJlZC1yZW1vdGUtY2F2ZS1DaGluYS5odG1s0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL3Blb3BsZXNkYWlseS9hcnRpY2xlLTMzNTU5NjkvYW1wL0dpYW50LXNhbGFtYW5kZXItbWVhc3VyaW5nLTRmdC03aW4tZGlzY292ZXJlZC1yZW1vdGUtY2F2ZS1DaGluYS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/12/11/13/2F46BEC400000578-0-image-a-30_1449839381693.jpg,2015-12-11,"{'sent': 'An enormous and incredibly rare salamander, estimated by experts to be over 200-years-old, has been found in an isolated karst cave in south-west China\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

This is exactly what Chinese media sources say happened last week when a fisherman discovered a Chinese giant salamander in a cave outside the city of Chongqing (map).

The gentle giant weighs 114 pounds (53 kilograms) and stretches over 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) long, according to the Chinese state-run publication People's Daily Online.

Believing the salamander to be ill, the fisherman contacted the authorities, which captured the animal and transferred it to a facility for “protection and further study.” (See ""4-Foot Salamander Arrives in London as Face of New Conservation Effort."")

While some subsequent news reports cite anonymous experts claiming the animal may be more than two centuries old, these estimates are at odds with what scientists know about the species.

Chinese Giant Salamander Moves to London Zoo Dec. 17, 2014 - Professor Wu, a Chinese giant salamander, is moved to the ZSL London Zoo.

“It is a big salamander, and they grow slowly,” says Theodore Papenfuss, a herpetologist and researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, “but the oldest I’ve heard of is 50 years, and that was in captivity.”

“I think 200 years is a big stretch.”

A Rare Find

Even if the animal likely hasn't been around since the Battle of Waterloo, it’s still an extremely rare find.

The Chinese giant salamander, which has declined in number by 80 percent in recent decades, is considered critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Its exact numbers are unknown.

“One of the main problems facing salamanders in China is that as fast as they’re caught, they are either going into breeding farms or they’re being eaten,” says Papenfuss.

Some people in China have even begun farming the salamanders by the thousands to meet demand. While farming could potentially help wild salamanders by supplying the industry with farm-raised animals, a study published earlier this year also warned it could threaten wild individuals by incubating and spreading disease. (Read ""Rare Giant Salamanders Bred in Captivity."")

Despite their rarity, finding a Chinese giant salamander in the wild isn’t entirely unheard of, adds Todd Pierson, a herpetologist at the University of Georgia and a National Geographic explorer.

“There are certainly still Andrias davidianus in the wild, and many of those that turn up, like this one, seem to be from caves,” he says.

Because the amphibians are so intensely harvested, Papenfuss says, it might be that caves are their last refuges.","This Giant Salamander Isn't 200 Years Old, But It's Still Super Rare",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE1LzEyLzE1MTIxNi1jaGluZXNlLWdpYW50LXNhbGFtYW5kZXJzLWFuaW1hbHMtc2NpZW5jZS1jaGluYS_SAX5odHRwczovL2FwaS5uYXRpb25hbGdlb2dyYXBoaWMuY29tL2Rpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi9wdWJsaWMvYW1wL25ld3MvMjAxNS8xMi8xNTEyMTYtY2hpbmVzZS1naWFudC1zYWxhbWFuZGVycy1hbmltYWxzLXNjaWVuY2UtY2hpbmE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2015/12/16/giant-chinese-salamander.ngsversion.1450454400536.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2015-12-16,"{'sent': 'If you’re ever wading through a river in China and step on something squishy, take care—you might be standing on Andrias davidianus, the largest amphibian on Earth.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

brunch

Updated: May 17, 2017 14:49 IST

As we climb down from a watchtower deep inside the forest, a tourist from another Gypsy asks, “Where are you guys coming from?”

“Delhi,” I say.

“Arre, then why come here? There’s Jim Corbett and Ranthambhore near your home, na!”

I try to explain that every jungle is unique and just because Kathmandu is closer to Delhi doesn’t mean I should not buy tickets for Kuala Lumpur.

The famous one-horn rhino. ( Saubhadra Chatterji )

Actually, I am a sinner. Long ago, I was posted in Assam for a year but didn’t see Kaziranga. It’s like visiting Egypt and not finding time for the pyramids.

The closest I came to Kaziranga was on a cold night in Guwahati, when my friend Samim Sultana said, “Let’s form a group and go to Kaziranga.” I think I yawned and said good night.

Turning savage

This time, I ask every Assamese I know: how do you get the best out of Kaziranga?

Rituparna, my colleague at the Hindustan Times, connects me to a travel company in Assam.

Leftist Sushanta Talukdar says, “Why do you want to stay there? You can see rhinos even from the highway.”

Finally, Achinta Borah sends me the number of Mukut Das, the Assistant Conservator of Forest, with a note: “He’s your best go-to person.”

Das helps me book the elephant safari without involving agents. He also gets me Kutub Ahmed, a top-rated guide in Kaziranga.

Five minutes after Kutub and his driver take my wife and me inside the Bagori range, we meet a rhino barely 20 meters away from our Gypsy. The fat fellow is happily grazing after a turf war. As the vehicle moves closer, the vegetarian stops eating and raises his head with a cold look.

Kutub panics. “Move out,” he directs the young driver. He has reasons to worry. Last week, three rhinos targeted his other car, leaving it almost beyond repair.

Our guide, Qutub, trying to spot a tiger. ( Saubhadra Chatterji )

“Rhinos can run very fast. Even elephants don’t dare to disturb them,” Kutub says from his 18 years’ experience as a safari guide.

My wife’s friend helped us book Borgos, an awesome resort with awfully slow service. But I don’t mind. This is a place to relax, not rush.

As three people at the reception try to fix the Wi-Fi service, I order a beer and chicken fry from its restaurant. The waiter comes with a bottle. ‘Savage Beer, extra strong’, the label reads. “Are you sure this is good?” I ask.

“Yeh best hai,” he announces.

After I am done with two Savage bottles, I start getting calls from the forest office detailing the elephant safari next morning. I understand Assamese, but now it sounds somewhat like Latin. The only word I remember is ‘elephant’.

A lone elephant having a meal in the forest. ( Saubhadra Chatterji )

Back in our room, my wife asks, “Everything finalised?” I promptly nod my head, “Of course!”

Early in the morning, the forest guy again calls. A young elephant is assigned for us. But our mahout is overcautious. He waits for all other elephants to arrive before approaching a rhino. The result: I miss some good photo ops. At the end of the safari, I realise it’s more difficult to get off an elephant. He’s a hot-blooded animal eager to go out. So, with two forest guards pulling me and one pushing me, I finally come down.

I try a new guide for a jungle safari in Kohora range. The guy has little interest in helping us spot animals. We drive around the muddy path interrupted with occasional comments like: “Sir, three days ago I saw a tiger here”, “four days ago I saw a tigress there.”

For the birds

Our cabbie from Guwahati takes us to a small, shabby outlet with a hoarding: Hornbill restaurant. But behind its dirty curtains is a brilliant world of Assamese food. When our thali comes, I am speechless. It is the best Assamese thali I’ve ever had, far better than Delhi’s overpriced Assam Bhawan.

A lip-smacking Assamese thali. ( Saubhadra Chatterji )

My wife declares, “If you give me such great vegetarian fare, I don’t need to eat non-veg.” Then, the country chicken curry arrives. She quickly changes her mind.

That afternoon, Kutub takes us to the westernmost range – Burapahar. An armed forest guard jumps into our vehicle and says, “You are the only tourist here today. I need to protect you from charging rhinos.”

In the fascinating terrain of Burapahar, we reach a point where the jungle suddenly comes to an end. There, the Brahmaputra, India’s mightiest river, flows slowly, eating away large tracts of land.

In the monsoon, almost every year, this river floods Kaziranga, leaving animals dead. But its devastating waters have also inspired poets, authors and singers of Assam and the North East. The confluence of the river and the jungle paints a serene portrait of nature. The air is so fresh. The sky is so clear. And all I hear is the sound of small waves bashing the bank.

Suddenly, Kutub turns the wheel and approaches a small patch of elephant grass. “Sshhh, don’t make noise. We’ll see a very rare bird. Bengal florican.” As soon as our car stops, a huge bird flaps its black and white wings and flies away. “Oh Lord, I see it after three years!” Kutub exclaims.

The Great Indian Hornbill is a famous inhabitant. ( Saubhadra Chatterji )

“The Bengal florican is so rare that there’s a special act to protect it. Recently, a foreigner spent 15 days in Kaziranga only to spot it and couldn’t find it,” says the overwhelmed guard. In that moment of ecstasy, I murmur: “When can we see a tiger?”

The armed guard, Kutub and my wife are aghast. “Sir, you just spotted a Bengal florican! A Bengal florican!!” says Kutub.

Back in Delhi, I run into my friend, NDTV’s Sandeep Phookan, on a blistering afternoon. “How was your Kaziranga trip?” he asks. “Not good. I spent not one, but three days, but couldn’t see a tiger.”

“S***”, the Assamese snubs. “I have been there at least 20 times. I am yet to see a tiger.”

I’d been in Cambodia six weeks, and this was one of the last villages left to survey. I was researching the impact of local communities’ livelihoods on a critically endangered bustard species; the Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis). Fewer than 1,500 florican remain globally, over 60% of which seasonally reside in the grasslands of Kampong Thom province, central Cambodia.

Male florican are distinctive. If you’re lucky, between February and April you may spy their beautiful black and white bodies leaping 30 metres into the air; performing to impress shy females. However, opportunities for encountering such moments are increasingly rare. In recent decades florican have undergone dramatic population declines, initially driven by over-hunting, but now by widespread habitat loss, primarily due to rice cultivation.

People I’ve met typically assume my time is spent in vast vistas, surrounded by swathes of jungle, spotting exotic wildlife. For me the reality is sleeping on a plank alongside cattle, surrounded by farmlands. I’m a member of the Interdisciplinary Centre of Conservation Science at Oxford University, and unlike typical ecological or biological approaches to conservation, we use a broad range of techniques developed from disciplines as varied as sociology, anthropology, psychology and economics to enhance understanding of complex socio-ecological systems. My research in Cambodia, recently published in Oryx, is reflective of our lab as a whole; instead of spending time in the field monitoring wildlife, we usually work in communities, trying to understand human behaviour.

Floodplain fieldwork

My team and I travelled by motorbike from village to village along dusty dirt roads. We spent a short time in each village conducting household surveys with a wide variety of people in a bid to better understand how communities live, and how their activities overlap with surrounding grasslands. Sometimes we were invited into peoples’ homes; others we sat beneath their stilted houses, perched on wooden beds or plastic chairs. Around our feet scabby puppies and occasionally piglets snuffled, grunted and squealed.

Agriculture has long played a role sculpting the landscape of central Cambodia, with rice cultivated on the floodplains since the Empire of Angkor (c.800-1400AD). But over the last two decades the production of rice has intensified. Whereas once rice was only grown for subsistence in wet season, usually in paddies naturally inundated by seasonal floods, nowadays rice is also grown throughout the dry season in newly converted fields, primarily for commerce. Great reservoirs and canal networks sprawl across the landscape, carved where grasslands once were. Across the dusty floodplain, dry season rice fields glow like green irrigated iridescent beacons.

Large scale dry season rice production emerged at the turn of the millennium, initially driven by profiteering businessmen. From my interviews I learned that this practice is now widespread among local communities, with nearly half of all households capitalising on the infrastructural investments made by urban elites to cultivate dry season rice. Koyuns, small hand-driven tractors, can be seen dotted alongside channels, extracting water. Plastic, python like tubes pump water back to paddies to grow this perceived “green gold”.

It was believed dry season rice was typically grown between December and March. However, my interviews revealed that nearly half of all dry season rice farmers now farm two crops of rice a year, extending the rice cultivation season into June. This is a relatively recent and previously undocumented trend, with significant implications for florican, who visit grasslands from February to July. Expansion of dry season rice not only means less habitat is available for floricans to forage and breed, but it also reduces the time for which it is available. Floricans return to the same large territories each year to mate. This means the miniscule populations that remain are likely returning to increasingly sub-optimal habitat.

In addition, around 95% of the dry season rice farmers I spoke to said that they use fertiliser or pesticides on their crop. Many have to borrow money in order to do so, and sometimes if their crops fail or the market collapses, they may find themselves indebted to credit lenders, forced to sell land to clear their debts. There are also considerable environmental and ecological implications. Agro-chemicals not only reduce food availability, but they typically include substances banned in the West, including DDT, a chemical known to cause egg thinning in birds. Fertilisers also filter into groundwater, impacting food webs. This is highly concerning, especially given the proximity to the Tonlé Sap, the largest inland fishery in Cambodia, and the lifeline of many throughout the land.

Conservation’s future

Conservation is complex, and we live in a rapidly changing world. Whereas once people measured their prosperity, health and happiness against that of their neighbours, today the advent of social media and the internet means that people compare themselves to others across the world. Nearly a half of households I surveyed had children that had left home to seek prosperity in the factories and sweatshops of Phnom Penh and Thailand. Priorities have changed. More of my interviewees owned a mobile phone (87%) than had access to a toilet (just 36%). Understanding how these changing priorities affect natural resource use is critical to the success of global conservation efforts.

For this reason, we also hosted focus groups in each village, bringing people together to discuss both conservation and options for the future. We asked about local perceptions of conservation work in the area. Some were unaware of conservation activities, whereas others applauded efforts – these were usually communities that had seen some returns from tourism. Others resented the limitations conservation placed on their livelihoods, citing too many costs and too few benefits.

If we are to successfully secure both the livelihoods of local people and the future of endangered species, then it is essential conservation is reconciled with development. One such medium is the Sustainable Rice Platform, an industry led initiative that encourages production of rice that meets sustainability standards. These include measures for protecting biodiversity, reducing pollution, gender equality, and supporting fair wages. In return, farmers that are supported to meet the standards receive stable, premium prices for their crop. NGO Wildlife Conservation Society are now piloting this in some surveyed villages.

It is clear that typical biological approaches are no longer enough. Too often conservation is filled with doom and gloom; relying on research that counts species to extinction. Instead, interdisciplinary, social research that engages local communities should be the norm.

0,"Conservationists are incensed after a TV station in southern China broadcast a cooking segment using the scales of pangolin, a protected species, to make a medicinal soup for breastfeeding mothers.

The health program, “Life Tips,” featured a recipe using 10 grams of pangolin scales alongside chicken feet and other herbal ingredients in a soup that was supposed to accelerate lactation. But since 2014, pangolins have been listed as “critically endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to “high levels of poaching for meat and scales.”

The segment had been broadcast on the Guangdong Radio and Television station several times but did not attract attention until Nov. 19, when an irate viewer calling herself “CJ” shared screenshots on microblog platform Weibo. On Saturday, the news drew a fresh wave of outrage when the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF) reposted it.

A screenshot from the Guangdong TV program ‘Life Tips’ shows pangolin scales for use as soup ingredients.

CJ told Sixth Tone on Tuesday that she had actually reposted the screenshots after seeing them first shared by a friend on another social media platform. “How could the TV station guide its audience to eat parts from a protected animal and recommend a recipe with unfounded medicinal effects?” read her post. “Have you lost your conscience?” The post has been shared 1,300 times and received more than 600 comments.

CJ said the episode’s director, Wu Jiayao, later contacted her on Weibo and told her that the show had reminded viewers that pangolins are protected. In screenshots of their conversation seen by Sixth Tone, Wu stressed that the production and purchase of pangolin scales through pharmacies is permitted.

“I felt like they were telling me, ‘Don’t waste your time — this issue will be forgotten,’” CJ said. Sixth Tone could not reach the show’s producers through a phone number listed on the website of Guangdong Radio and Television.

Li Enze, a lawyer at Beijing Yipai Law Firm, confirmed that while eating pangolin is illegal, the law still allows for the use of pangolin scales in traditional medicine, in accordance with the nation’s wildlife protection law. Sales of pangolin scales are strictly controlled by China’s State Forestry Administration: By 2015, the last year for which data is available, the annual limit for pangolin scales was around 26,000 kilograms.

The use of pangolin in traditional Chinese medicine dates from the Ming Dynasty, when Li Shizhen wrote Bencao Gangmu, an herbology tome that remained a key reference for centuries. According to a survey conducted by U.S. environmental organization WildAid in 2015, more than 70 percent of over 3,000 Chinese respondents believed that pangolin scales can treat rheumatic diseases, asthma, and cancer. Though 74 percent of interviewees knew it was illegal to eat pangolin, they also considered it a symbol of prestige to dine on the forbidden animal.

Smuggled pangolin scales seized by customs officers are shown at a press conference in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, Nov. 29, 2016. IC

Zhang Siyuan, the acting director of the pangolin group at the CBCGDF, told Sixth Tone that there is no scientific evidence for the animal’s medicinal uses, and that some scholars say synthetic substitutes are perfectly adequate. She said that there is no justification for using exotic animal parts unless they are effective, harmless, and the only ingredient that can achieve results.

Zhang added that though traditional medical texts only refer to the Chinese pangolin, foreign species have suffered, too, as the legal domestic supply has failed to keep up with demand, thereby creating a market for smugglers. In November, Shenzhen authorities uncovered a case that involved 11.9 tons of pangolin scales smuggled from Africa.

According to expert estimates in 2010, the demand for pangolins in the Chinese market is around 200,000 animals each year: half for food, and half for medicinal products. In February, Chinese social media lit up with incredulity at a two-year-old post where a writer boasted of being treated to a pangolin dinner by government officials. And in August, a video showing a pangolin being slaughtered received wide public attention and triggered a police investigation.

Pangolin is not the only species to become endangered because of consumption demands. Earlier this month, the IUCN designated the yellow-breasted bunting — a species now believed to increase men’s sexual potency — “critically endangered” because “the overall rate of population decline is even greater than previously thought.” In 2000, the species was merely listed as “lower risk/least concern.”

0,"The Pangolin Consortium, a partnership between six U.S. zoos and Pangolin Conservation, an NGO, launched a project in 2014 which today houses fifty White-bellied tree pangolins (Phataginus tricuspis).

Common knowledge says that pangolins are almost impossible to keep alive in captivity, but the consortium has done basic research to boost survival rates, traveling to Africa and working with a company, EnviroFlight, to develop a natural nutritious insect-derived diet for pangolins in captivity.

While some conservationists are critical of the project, actions by the Pangolin Consortium have resulted in high captive survival rates, and even in the successful breeding of pangolins in captivity.

The Pangolin Consortium is able to conduct basic research under controlled conditions at zoos on pangolin behavior and health – research that can’t be done in the wild. Zoos can also present pangolins to the public, educating about their endangered status, improving conservation funding.

“When we first started talking about pangolins, people thought we were saying ‘penguin,'” says Amy Roberts, Curator of Mammals at Chicago’s Brookfield Zoo. That remains a problem, even today, with the majority of Americans still not knowing what pangolins look like, much less how much deep trouble they’re in.

This is just one issue addressed by the Pangolin Consortium – a partnership of six U.S. zoos, along with the Florida-based NGO, Pangolin Conservation. This alliance, begun in 2014, now holds around fifty African White-bellied tree pangolins (Phataginus tricuspis) including a few born in captivity.

Which is remarkable, considering that the common wisdom is that captive pangolins almost always quickly waste away and die.

There are eight species of wild Asian and African pangolins in the world today, all under extreme pressure from illegal trafficking – especially due to hunting for bushmeat and use of their scales in traditional medicine.

Often called the world’s most trafficked mammal, all eight species are considered by the IUCN to be threatened with extinction. Numbers of the Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) have declined by 90 percent, and recent research showed that 2.71 million pangolins of the African species are killed every year in Central Africa, an increase of 145 percent since 2000.

Some conservationists argue that pangolins ­– with such rapidly plummeting wild populations, and perceived high rates of mortality in zoos – should not be held at all in captivity. But the Pangolin Consortium argues just the opposite: to conserve remaining wild populations, scientists need to know far more about these unusual animals, data that can only be gleaned under controlled conditions like those seen in zoos.

The Pangolin Consortium is working diligently to gain that knowledge, and has already made significant breakthroughs. And the more they learn about captive pangolins, say these experts, the more hope there may be for wild ones.

The captive pangolin diet

Diet was widely supposed to be the biggest problem with keeping pangolins healthy and alive in captivity, so that was the first problem that Justin Miller, founder of Pangolin Conservation, set out to solve.

In the wild pangolins eat insects, using a long, sticky tongue similar to that of an anteater. This diet can be challenging to replicate for a number of reasons. “For a long time, zoos fed them everything from mince meat to dog food, milk, eggs – nothing insect-based –just readily available food that the pangolin would accept,” Miller says.

He had become familiar with research done in Taipei, Taiwan where zoos achieved success at keeping and breeding the local pangolin species, data that clarified some key dietary factors. However, just adopting the Taipei diet wasn’t an option, as it included ingredients not readily available in the United States, such as bee larvae and silkworm pupae.

So Miller initiated his own research in 2013. First he needed to figure out exactly what wild White-bellied tree pangolins eat. He went to Africa to observe pangolin eating habits and to collect insects, sending them back to the U.S. for nutritional analysis. Miller recalls that he needed a lot of bugs, so he hired locals to gather them, despite the fact that this wasn’t the most appealing business opportunity.

“It was hard to convince people to catch ants,” he says. “When I tried to show them how, it was just entertainment to watch me be bitten en masse during a few failures. I had to start an impressive system of supply and demand with ant prices changing daily, and even hourly, to get the amounts needed.”

Next Miller had to convert that nutritional analysis into a food product using ingredients readily available in the United States. Sourcing those ingredients involved networking and creativity. One important consultant was John Gramieri, the Austin, Texas Zoo’s general curator, and former director of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Taxon Advisory Group in charge of xeanrthrans (anteaters, armadillos and sloths), aardvarks and pangolins.

Gramieri had helped develop a similar insect-derived diet for captive armadillos, shifting the animals away from the meat diet generally served them in zoos. “I bemoaned the fact that there was very little opportunity in this country to buy insect matter in a manner that was cost effective,” Gramieri says. “If you wanted to feed an armadillo nothing but mealworms, that was incredibly expensive.”

Then, one day, someone showed him a United Nations report on insects for human consumption, and it mentioned a company called EnviroFlight. The firm was raising black soldier flies and producing rose fertilizer from their castings and fish food from their larvae. He sent EnviroFlight an email, wondering if there was some chance he could get the raw insects minus the processing.

“They called me and said, ‘We’ve got two tons of this stuff in the freezer, what do you want to do with it?’” he says.

This led to a couple years research developing an ideal insect-based armadillo diet, which put Gramieri in the perfect position to advise Miller and connect the pangolin researcher with suppliers. Again, Enviroflight turned out to be an excellent collaborator and supplier, but then the delivered insect larvae caused practical problems.

“First we got [the larvae] in whole, and they broke a bunch of machines because they gummed them up,” says Jennifer Watts, director of nutrition at the Brookfield Zoo.

“The only way we could effectively grind them up, because of the [high] fat content, was to put dry ice with them, freeze them, then grind them,” Miller relates. “But then EnviroFlight said, ‘we can use a cold press, and we can press out the fat and give you what’s left over.'” The company was also able to modify the amount of protein and nutrients in the larvae based on what they were fed.

Once Miller designed a nutritionally complete pangolin diet, he acclimated the animals to it while they were still in Africa. “I started them off on their wild diet of ants and termites, and then slowly switched them over to the prepared diet,” he says. This way, when the animals arrived in the U.S., they didn’t need to be persuaded to eat strange food while also acclimating to new surroundings. Lessening stress, the researchers were learning, meant happier, healthier pangolins.

Preparing for the big move

Another reason pangolins have done poorly in captivity historically is that often captive animals in the past were rescues from trafficking confiscations, so they started out in poor health, which only got worse.

Confiscated pangolins “have been in stressful conditions, either obtained from bushmeat markets or hunters,” explains Miller. “They can go through capture myopathy – a buildup of stress that ends up damaging their heart muscles.” When that happens, animals may appear to be doing well, but there is [cardiac] damage, “and then any sort of stressful event can lead to heart failure.”

This and other health deficits due to illegal wildlife trafficking puts the animals at a high risk of dying in transit, or shortly thereafter.

In contrast, the Pangolin Consortium did everything possible to assure that the animals brought to the U.S. beginning in 2015 started out in good health. While still in their native countries, the pangolins were treated for parasites and infections, with Miller assessing each individual. “Any specimens that showed signs of stress, or any other factors that made them poor candidates, were released into safe areas near their original collection sites [in the wild].” That turned out to be about thirty percent. The remaining captive pangolins were adapted slowly to the presence of people and unusual noises, “primarily consisting of NPR [National Public Radio] and [electric] fans,” Miller says.

Miller also minimized the stress and risk of travel, replacing the shocks on transport vehicles to give a smoother ride. “All vans had air conditioning, and I had a spare van follow us in case of vehicle problems. We only traveled during the night so the otherwise busy roads would be clear and allow for shorter transit time and cooler weather in case of air conditioner problems,” he relates. “I never let any specimens out of my sight until they were loaded onto the plane. Even then, I stayed at the cargo warehouse until the plane was in the sky.”

Settling in

Once in the United States, the first priority was to ensure the wellbeing of the pangolins. Only one was put on public exhibit, at Brookfield, while the rest remained in seclusion.

“What everyone has committed to is making sure these animals are well established behind the scenes,” says Gramieri. “We want to do a full and detailed analysis of their behavior, their hormone values, their food consumption. We want to be able to assess that in a private, non-trafficked space, so if we do put them on display, we’ll be able to see if their behavior changes at all.”

At Brookfield, the researchers will be analyzing stress hormones, determining the estrous cycle, and monitoring pregnancies – natural processes never scientifically observed in this, or pretty much in any African pangolin species.

“We are collecting fecals on everyone, every day, for the first year,” Roberts says. The animals are kept in slightly different environments, to see if minor variations affect their behaviors and health. For example, two settings utilize true reverse lighting to simulate nocturnal conditions, while another allows some daylight in. “There are differences in keeper activity, humidity, noise. We’re tracking [all of that] so we can correlate down the road with the fecal hormone results.”

Meanwhile, Miller’s facility is starting a study, analyzing stress hormones in any pangolins utilized in public outreach presentations to make sure those individuals are not being negatively impacted.

It’s hoped that all of this advance planning, attention to detail and careful research is likely to increase the chance of success with Phataginus tricuspis, as is the coordination and communication within the consortium.

“We’ve never been in a better position within the zoological community to quickly exchange information between facilities and rapidly analyze data like nutritional requirements,” Miller reports. “For example, say our animals have their blood analyzed and it shows a nutritional deficiency. We can then rapidly alter the diet, send it off for analysis, and follow up with new blood work weeks later.”

In addition, Grameiri’s research has now led him to question the conventional wisdom that pangolins do poorly in captivity. In fact, he says, their lifespans at zoos were improving even before the Pangolin Consortium project began. He has analyzed longevity records and found survival trend statistics that are much better than the figures often cited, which he says incorrectly interpreted data from currently living animals. By analyzing records of 296 pangolins held in zoos since the animals first appear in records in 1954, he found that the captive lifespan has steadily increased. The 45 animals in zoos at the time of his analysis had been in human care for an average 7 years 8 months, which included many that had been in captivity more than ten years so far.

Breeding pangolins

Helping pangolins survive better in captivity is one thing, breeding pangolins in captivity is quite another matter. Miller says that captive breeding was never a realistic possibility before in Western zoos, because most facilities had so few animals to work with, and because many had been confiscation rescues in poor health.

But there was evidence it could be possible – the Taipei Zoo bred Formosan pangolins to the third generation. And indeed, the Pangolin Consortium project has already seen successful zoo births. Most offspring, like two recently weaned at Brookfield, had mothers already pregnant when they arrived at the zoo. However, in November, Miller’s facility saw a successful birth from an animal bred since arriving.

Maintaining genetic diversity is important for captive populations, and advance planning is underway to assure it. “We’re doing genetic work on each and every individual of all the founder animals to figure out which to breed together for the maximum amount of diversity,” says Miller. “For a lot of species we don’t have that [baseline data] for the founder stock.”

While there are no current plans to release captive animals to the wild – where the situation for pangolins is still dire – this attention to genetic health of a captive population will be important for any future reintroductions.

Ambassadors and more

Some conservationists have objected to the strategy of bringing pangolins into captivity.

Along with the concerns about maintaining them in good health in captivity – an issue that the Pangolin Constortium’s work seems to be addressing successfully – another concern that has been expressed is that the collecting of pangolins for zoos places additional pressure on wild populations. Gramieri thinks it’s worth looking at the statistics: according to conservative estimates “there’s more than a pangolin an hour being poached.” Compared to poaching figures in the millions, the number of animals that have been taken into zoos is miniscule.

Pangolin Consortium participants argue that the contribution their efforts make to preserving pangolins in the wild far outweigh the capture of small numbers of individuals, and they have taken significant steps toward that goal. For example, every U.S. zoo that received pangolins was required to pledge its support to in situ conservation. “All the facilities signed off on a strict set of agreements to ensure that this collaborative consortium facilitated research and conservation goals,” says Miller. This includes a mandatory yearly donation that will be pooled and distributed to selected grant applicants who are conducting in situ and ex situ conservation projects.

The consortium is also assisting conservation in the wild in other ways. Knowledge gained about the behaviors and breeding of captive pangolins will almost certainly provide useful information that will help their wild relatives.

“We’re doing research that would be very difficult in the wild,” says Miller. For example, existing pangolin “reproduction data was grossly inaccurate ­– such as gestation and age of maturity, basic modeling of the population and what is sustainable – none of this is [currently] known, and all can be based off data [gathered] from our captive population.”

The careful veterinary attention given to captive pangolins, and veterinary knowledge gained, also has the potential to aid wild populations, especially animals seized from traffickers and in need of immediate medical care and rehabilitation in preparation for return to the wild.

Miller says it’s unclear how effective current rehabilitation practices are, but notes that the baseline health data gathered at the zoos could be critical to contributing to the health of confiscated and wild populations. He points out that this is information that cannot be easily gathered or analyzed in rehab facilities.

Rehab centers “may never have seen a healthy pangolin heart,” he says. “They could be releasing specimens that won’t fare well because they have damaged hearts.” Data from a healthy captive population will make it possible to more accurately assess the health of rehabbed animals before release, upping their chances for survival back in the wild.

There is one last argument in support of the Pangolin Consortium’s captive pangolin program, which brings us back to where this story began: nobody is likely to care about conserving pangolins if they’ve never heard of them, and can’t even keep pangolins straight from penguins.

When it comes to conservation, public education, recognition and awareness matters. That’s clearly why the Eastern mountain gorilla is receiving significant amounts of conservation funding today, while the Bornean white-bearded gibbon is not.

Gramieri points out that while only one pangolin is on exhibit right now, when it becomes possible to display more, the combined consortium zoos could potentially expose more than seven million visitors per year to this amazing keritan-armored animal.

“We think this is a very important way of getting the American people involved in the plight of the pangolin,” Gramieri says.

Put that potential for education together with the financial and research support for in situ conservation, and the Pangolin Consortium can be seen as a bold innovator: offering a proactive conservation model by which zoos support in situ species survival. Says Gramieri, “This is exactly what zoos are supposed to do.”

Response to Mongabay Pangolin Article (Posted Feb 9, 2018)

By Lisa Hywood, CEO & Founder of Tikki Hywood Foundation, Zimbabwe and Thai Van Nguyen, Executive Director, Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, Vietnam

We are writing in response to the Jan. 5 article in Mongabay entitled “U.S. Zoos Learn How to Keep Captive Pangolins Alive, Helping Wild Ones.”

The article, which excluded insights from any pangolin conservation groups, asserts that the “Pangolin Consortium” – a partnership between six U.S. zoos and a non-profit organization – is saving pangolins by taking them from the wild in Togo and keeping them in U.S. zoos.

One of the main problems with this rationale – that we can save pangolins by transitioning them to captive environments – is that pangolins have a very high mortality rate during capture and in captivity. As such, displaying them in zoos might require a constant flow of wild pangolins into captivity. This is something we can’t risk given pangolins are threatened with extinction and are the most trafficked mammal on earth, with over one million poached for their scales (used in traditional Asian medicine) and meat over the past decade. Indeed, pangolins are in such grave danger that the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Pangolin Specialist Group – the world’s foremost experts on pangolins – expressed serious concern with the Consortium’s actions in a recent letter to the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).

Fortunately, at a recent meeting between organizations working on pangolin conservation and the Consortium, the zoos committed to stop importing pangolins from the wild. In other words, even if those they have die; they will not be replaced with wild-caught pangolins. While we remain concerned about the way in which the Consortium acquired its original 45 pangolins, this is an extremely positive step.

We are hopeful that the Consortium will now adhere to global conservation action plans developed for pangolins by the IUCN Pangolin Specialist Group, which outline the top priorities for saving such species, such as reducing consumer demand and stopping illegal trafficking. Indeed, zoos can and should be involved in saving these species – as they have other threatened animals – through actions like supporting rescue, rehabilitation and release facilities in countries that make up the pangolins’ habitat like Zimbabwe’s Tikki Hywood Foundation and Save Vietnam’s Wildlife; launching initiatives in consumer nations to help reduce the demand for pangolins; and developing digital media and awareness raising campaigns to raise the profile of pangolins globally.

Pangolin populations have undergone such massive declines that we need all hands on deck to prevent the extinction of these unique animals. This means working together to carry out the conservation plans developed by pangolin experts, which prioritize protecting wild populations and their habitat and cracking down on trade—not removing pangolins from their habitat.","U.S. zoos learn how to keep captive pangolins alive, helping wild ones",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5tb25nYWJheS5jb20vMjAxOC8wMS91LXMtem9vcy1sZWFybi1ob3ctdG8ta2VlcC1jYXB0aXZlLXBhbmdvbGlucy1hbGl2ZS1oZWxwaW5nLXdpbGQtb25lcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2018/01/05122924/FEATURED-pan-768x445.jpg,2018-01-05,"{'sent': 'The Pangolin Consortium, a partnership between six U.S. zoos and Pangolin Conservation, an NGO, launched a project in 2014 which today houses fifty White-bellied tree pangolins (Phataginus tricuspis).\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The Pangolin Consortium'], 'CARDINAL': ['six', 'fifty'], 'GPE': ['Pangolin Conservation', 'U.S.']}}",Pangolin
0,"Students learn wildlife conservation benefits

Students in Kampong Thom and Siem Reap provinces last week learned that protecting wildlife can be beneficial to both local communities and the environment at a workshop hosted by the Wildlife Conservation Society.

Nheb Nguen, a WCS representative, said the students were brought from their respective provinces to the workshop to highlight the importance of protecting the Bengal Florican and other water birds.

More than 200 students participated in the workshop that mainly focused on wildlife awareness for the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape.

“It has been the role of school children to find nests and guard over these animals throughout the years,” said Mr Nguen.

“Awareness of these issues benefit local communities by earning money through ecotourism projects,” he added. “At the same time, conservation could reduce the threat to wildlife from poachers.”

The Bengal Florican is listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

According to IUCN data, the current population of the Bengal Florican is decreasing, with a global population of fewer than 800.

Cambodia plays a critical role in conserving the habitat of these birds. In Cambodia, there are approximately 432 Bengal Floricans in the country, and their numbers are dwindling.

The Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape was established in 2016. The protected status of the land allows for 31,156 hectares to cross Kampong Thom and Siem Reap provinces.

WCS works closely with the Environment Ministry to conserve wildlife on the protected lands by assisting law enforcement, protecting bird nests and raising awareness.

Using a formula published in a PLOS ONE Study, each species receives a score that takes into account how evolutionarily unusual it is as well as its risk for extinction.

ZSL hopes these rankings will provide a scientifically rigorous and standardized method to assign conservation priority to vanishing species.

What do the world’s tiniest chameleon, a color-changing snake, and a turtle that breathes through its genitals have in common? Each of these reptiles sits perched on its own unique branch of life and, according to Zoological Society of London (ZSL), is headed for extinction unless urgent steps are taken for their protection.

The ZSL has released a list of 100 Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered Reptiles through its EDGE of Existence program. Using a formula published in a PLOS ONE Study, each species receives a score that takes into account how evolutionarily unusual it is as well as its risk for extinction. ZSL hopes these rankings will provide a scientifically rigorous and standardized method to assign conservation priority to vanishing species.

“When EDGE launched in 2007,” said EDGE of Existence Program Manager Nisha Owen, “our vision was to shine a light on those species that, if they were allowed to go extinct, would effectively take an entire branch of the Tree of Life with them.”

EDGE has published lists for mammals, birds, amphibians, and corals in the past and has partnered with other organizations to fund work at the frontlines of conservation. Beyond increasing awareness of these high priority life forms, EDGE and partners invest in early-career conservationists and conservation research, working with species from the pangolin to the Philippine Eagle.

“Reptiles often receive the short end of the stick in conservation terms, compared with the likes of birds and mammals,” said EDGE Reptiles co-ordinator Rikki Gumbs. “However, the EDGE Reptile List highlights just how unique, vulnerable and amazing these creatures really are. From the world’s largest sea turtles to a blind species of snake found only in Madagascar, the diversity of EDGE Reptiles is breath-taking.”

Breath-taking indeed. This top 100 list includes the charismatic, slick, and scaly likes of turtles, tortoises, geckos, lizards, snakes, chameleons, and crocodiles which demonstrate some unusual survival strategies. The #1 EDGE ranking Madagascan big-headed turtle (Erymnochelys madagascariensis) has large, golden plates which protect its big head; the Pig-nosed turtle (Carettochelys insculpta) uses its pig-like snout as a snorkel; and the Mary River turtle (Elusor macrurus) can breathe underwater for up to three days.

“Just as with tigers, rhinos and elephants, it is vital we do our utmost to save these unique and too often overlooked animals,” said Gumbs.

“Many EDGE Reptiles are the sole survivors of ancient lineages, whose branches of the Tree of Life stretch back to the age of the dinosaurs. If we lose these species there will be nothing like them left on Earth,” Gumbs continued. “We also hope to bring the plight of these weird and wonderful creatures to the public’s attention before they disappear.”

The population of Chinese salamanders has witnessed a significant decrease in recent years, with the species plagued by habitat loss and excessive poaching. Once thought to appear widely across China, the Chinese Giant Salamander now faces threats of extinction, in large part because of demand for the amphibian as a delicacy.

Why Chinese Giant Salamanders Are Decreasing

""The overexploitation of these incredible animals for human consumption has had a catastrophic effect on their numbers in the wild over an amazingly short time span,"" said Zoological Society of London's Samuel Turvey. ""Unless coordinated conservation measures are put in place as a matter of urgency, the future of the world's largest amphibian is in serious jeopardy.""

The researchers investigated 97 sites in 16 of China's 23 provinces and found that the once-ubiquitous species now critically endangered. While Chinese laws prohibit salamander harvesting, illegal poaching practices persist, according to the study, which was published in the Current Biology journal. Some target salamanders for their parts to use in traditional Chinese medicine.

At present, the International Union for Conservation of Nature categorizes Chinese Giant Salamanders as critically endangered animals. Common belief around biological circles claims this species is a derivative of an ancient salamander group that lived 170 million years ago, which is one of the major reasons why humans should put effort toward their conservation.

But such an undertaking could prove difficult, according to a related study also published in Current Biology, since Chinese Giant Salamanders are possibly eight species, a discovery that stunned scientists and ""sat us back in our chairs,"" said Jing Che, of the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Updating Conservation Methods

Commercial farms that have been breeding the animals and releasing them in the wild without ample consideration of their genetic makeup must be checked, according to the scientists. Because these farms' only goal is to multiply the number of Chinese Giant Salamanders, they could unknowingly mix lineages and make some species prone to maldaptation under different environments.

As such, conservation methods for the animals need urgent updating, according to Che. One such update is establishing specially designed reserves for protecting farm-bred baby Chinese Giant Salamanders.

According to study coauthor Fang Yan, we must create suitable safeguards to protect the genetic makeup of these animals.

0,"Scientists who spent four years surveying the Chinese giant salamander’s preferred river habitats across 97 counties in China spotted only 24 individuals at four sites.

None of the 24 individuals were “pure natural forms,” the researchers found, and were likely farm releases or escapees.

The Chinese giant salamander also represents not one but at least five different species-level lineages. However, the large extent of hybridization in these animals through farming could mean that these distinct lineages are already functionally extinct.

The world’s largest amphibian has become vanishingly rare in the wild, a new study has found.

The Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) can reach lengths of more than 1.8 meters (6 feet), taller than many humans, making them hard to miss. Yet scientists who spent four years surveying the salamander’s preferred river habitats across 97 counties in China spotted only 24 individuals at four sites. In all, it took them 16 weeks on an average to detect one salamander, the team of Chinese and Western researchers report in a new study published in Current Biology.

Compare this with the time it took researchers to spot the two other giant salamander species in past surveys: a little more than an hour to spot one Japanese giant salamander (Andrias japonicus) in Japan, and a little over two hours to spot an individual hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) in the eastern U.S.

The dearth of detections despite such an extensive survey suggests that the once-widespread Chinese giant salamander has now vanished from much of its range, the researchers say. The species’ slide toward extinction is largely because the creatures are illegally collected from the wild for farming as a luxury food item. Millions of Chinese giant salamanders are being farmed today. And most breeding individuals in these farms have either been caught from the wild, or are first-generation offspring of wild-caught salamanders.

“The overexploitation of these incredible animals for human consumption has had a catastrophic effect on their numbers in the wild over an amazingly short time span,” Samuel Turvey, lead author of the study and a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London, U.K., said in a statement.

However, the extremely low number of individuals in the wild is not the only worry the researchers have.

None of the 24 Chinese giant salamanders that the team found may be “truly” wild, the researchers say. Instead, they are likely farmed individuals that either escaped or were released into the wild as part of government-promoted conservation initiatives to protect the salamander, currently listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List.

In a second study, also published in Current Biology, researchers found that the Chinese giant salamander represents not one, but at least five different species-level lineages. Robert Murphy, a professor at the University of Toronto, Canada, who had previously suspected that the salamander could be a “composite of more than one cryptic species,” teamed up with researchers from China and elsewhere to collect tissue samples from 70 wild-caught and 1,034 farm-bred salamanders. Genetic analysis of the wild-caught individuals confirmed that the Chinese giant salamander once consisted of at least five distinct lineages, each associated with a different river system. But genetic analysis of the farmed salamanders showed extensive genetic mixing among the individuals.

This is worrying, the conservationists say.

“The real shock came when we discovered the extent of genetic mixing that occurred via hybridizing the species during farming,” Murphy told Mongabay. “We were also surprised at discovering that many of these hybrids had been released in nature.”

None of the 24 individuals that the researchers detected over the four-year survey were “pure natural forms,” said Jing Che, from the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. “This means that current conservation initiatives are driving genetic pollution in nature. This could be a huge problem,” she said.

Hybridization is a problem because it results in the creation of new genetic products such as essential proteins and enzymes, and too much genetic variation can be quite harmful, Murphy said. “This is what the farms have done,” he added. “By analogy, if you send one person to change a light bulb, the task is usually quick and simple. However, if you send 10 people, and all must participate, things slow down to a snail’s pace and nothing works well.”

The extent of hybridization among the Chinese giant salamanders could also mean that the distinct wild lineages are either already functionally extinct, or nearly there, the researchers say.

“Most conservation laws are based on species,” Che said. “When you divide one species into many, each has a smaller distribution than before and lower numbers of individuals. What might be endangered in the former case, now becomes critically endangered with extinction in the latter situation. Unfortunately, extinction may have occurred already.”

The release of farmed salamanders into rivers may be well-intentioned, the researchers say, but it’s being done without any prior genetic testing or disease screening.

This is partly because the conservation managers responsible are either “unaware of the genetic consequences of hybridization, or summarily dismiss expressed concerns,” Murphy said. “In a zeal to gain public and government favour, the conservationists have created a genetic mess. The same holds true for not screening for disease. Efforts to restock the giant salamanders could be harming other native species via infections.”

Murphy cautioned that no good could come from these “uninformed releases.”

“These activities should stop immediately,” he said. “The hope is that genetic screening can identify pure individuals which can then be used in government-run farms whose only purpose is to recover natural populations, and by using genetic and disease screening before releasing babies.”

0,"The Chinese giant salamander does not fit the traditional definition of “cute.” Growing to nearly six feet long and weighing roughly 140 pounds, the flabby creatures are the largest amphibians in the world. Their beady, lidless eyes peer out from broad, flat heads with blunt snouts, and their mud-colored bodies have short limbs and long tails. The species’ slimy skin is not pleasant to pet, either.

With these characteristics, the amphibians are certainly not as charismatic as pandas and other fluffy mammals, but they’re just as crucial to a healthy ecosystem. In two studies published last week, scientists found that instead of one species—as previously thought—there are actually roughly half a dozen species of Chinese giant salamander.

“We weren’t surprised to find two or three [species],” says Bob Murphy, senior curator of herpetology at the Royal Ontario Museum’s Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation Biology, and corresponding author on one of the papers. “[But] we were surprised at just how much diversity was there. At least five and up to eight species, that was quite a shock.""

However, humans might have already driven some of those species toward extinction. In their endemic habitat of rocky mountain streams and lakes in China, the critically endangered salamanders are threatened by poaching and human intervention.

“The bigger issue, I think, is trying to change ideas about what conservation needs to happen for these iconic animals,” Murphy says.

Decades of Research

Chinese giant salamanders are rare in the wild but raised on farms to be sold as a luxury food item. A four-pound salamander can go for up to $1,500 in some markets, and they’re prepared in soups, stews, and other dishes.

Traditionally, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has called for farmers to release a portion of their salamanders into the wild in an attempt at conservation. In the last decade, more than 72,000 have been let go.

But this conservation technique is flawed, experts say. When farmers release captive-bred salamanders, the animals are not genetically screened or looked at for diseases. They can breed with other salamanders in the wild, and the resulting offspring could have too much genetic variation. This diversity could be harmful to the species.

“The system begins to break down, and then you end up with lower developmental rates and a bunch of inefficient salamanders that can result in a population loss,” Murphy says. “You mix all of that together and the salamanders are lost.”

The studies that spurred this revelation began more than two decades ago with funding from the National Geographic Society. They fizzled out but were reactivated in 2007 when the researchers returned with new technology, Murphy says. Armed with more advanced tools for genetic analysis, they discovered that there were at least five species of Chinese giant salamander, and could be as many as eight.

“Back in 1992, things in China were very different, so it was hard getting into the field without permissions,” Murphy says. “We didn’t have a whole lot of samples and the genetic techniques, by today’s standards, were quite primitive.”

Slithering Forward

Murphy says that if these conservation techniques of releasing unscreened salamanders into the wild continue, diversity could whittle down into one species of Chinese giant salamander in 10 to 20 years.

“These are monstrous salamanders,” he says. “An animal this large plays a big role within ecosystems and we don’t know what affect its ultimate removal might be.”

Murphy says that conservation could start with educating school-age children about the importance of saving species like the Chinese giant salamander. It’s difficult to change the minds of adults, he adds, but teaching children the importance of conservation early on could have lasting impacts.",5 Giant Salamander Species Identified—And They're All in Danger,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LzA1L2NoaW5lc2UtZ2lhbnQtc2FsYW1hbmRlci1zcGVjaWVzLWFuaW1hbHMv0gFwaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkubmF0aW9uYWxnZW9ncmFwaGljLmNvbS9kaXN0cmlidXRpb24vcHVibGljL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDUvY2hpbmVzZS1naWFudC1zYWxhbWFuZGVyLXNwZWNpZXMtYW5pbWFscw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/591/399/smpost_1527630155831.jpg,2018-05-29,"{'sent': 'Growing to nearly six feet long and weighing roughly 140 pounds, the flabby creatures are the largest amphibians in the world.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['nearly six feet', 'roughly 140 pounds']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"Lake Pátzcuaro, the third largest lake in Mexico, lies a little more than 200 miles west of Mexico City. As an endorheic basin, the lake does not drain into the sea—and it’s the sole home for a rare, unique species of salamander.

Locally known as “achoques,” the Lake Pátzcuaro salamander (Ambystoma dumerilii) is an amphibian that lives its entire life in freshwater. With gills that flare out when submersed, the salamander looks similar to the axolotl, a relative. It’s critically endangered, with rough estimates saying there are fewer than 100 individuals left in the wild.

“This could be extinct in the next 20 or 30 years,” Omar Domínguez, a conservation biologist at Morelia’s Michoacán University, writes in an email.

But it seems the Lake Pátzcuaro salamander is getting some divine intervention. With Domínguez as breeding program coordinator, a convent, a zoo, and Michoacán University are teaming up in an international conservation effort to save the species. (Related: read about the hellbender, a giant U.S. salamander on the brink of extinction.)

“This is probably the first time a religious community has been involved with amphibian conservation,” says Gerardo Garcia, a Chester Zoo expert who is closely involved in the conservation effort. “Everybody can be a conservationist.”

Saving Salamanders

In 2014, Gerardo Garcia, who is also the curator of lower vertebrates and invertebrates at the Chester Zoo in England, visited Mexico while working on a breeding program for threatened freshwater fish. While in country, his colleagues at Michoacán University encouraged him to visit the Sisters of the Monastery of the Dominican Order—and their salamander conservation operations—in nearby Pátzcuaro. (Watch: “5 Giant Salamander Species Identified—Any They’re All in Danger”)

“It’s not something I generally do on my fieldtrip, going to meet the nuns,” Garcia says.

For the past 150 years, the nuns in the convent had been sustainably raising the rare salamanders. The amphibians are a crucial ingredient in a mysterious medicine the convent makes that is believed to cure coughs, asthma, and anemia, so the women breed the animals in order to keep their tradition alive. (Related: “The Secret Lives of Mexican Nuns”)

Of the 23 nuns in the convent, three or four live and work at the breeding facility at a time to take care of the animals. The facility is made up of two large rooms filled with tanks that can hold up to 400 salamanders. The nuns feed organic earthworms to the amphibians and use a nearby well to change their water regularly. (Related: Meet Professor Wu, the only Chinese giant salamander in the U.K.)

“They have a fresh environment, freshly harvested food, and they have a fully dedicated staff,” Garcia says. “It’s just what they need. You almost create an ideal environment for the endangered species.”

Giant Salamanders Helped to Spawn December 31, 2009—A new program in Japan is helping giant salamanders get past dams built to control flooding so the rare amphibians can lay their eggs upstream.

In addition to the everyday needs of the salamanders, the nuns measure and microchip the animals, as well as pair them up for breeding. Garcia says that the untrained eye can’t distinguish one salamander from another, but the nuns, with all their years of experience, can. (Related: “How a Runaway Nun Helped an Outlaw Monk Change the World”)

Around the World

The Chester Zoo also has a small population of Lake Pátzcuaro salamanders in England, and the Michoacán University and a private breeder have populations in Mexico. But Garcia says the population at the convent is the most viable because the salamanders live the closest to their native environment. The closer they are to the lake, the less likely the animals are to be exposed to alien pathogens. (Related: read about the biggest amphibian on Earth)

“These specimens that we have in Europe may not be as vital as the animals they have in the convent or in the university,” Garcia says. “All the different questions we need to address in the lake are in the communities.”

As a top predator, Domínguez says the salamanders are important to Mexican biodiversity. They have also been a staple of the region since Pre-Hispanic times, he adds, and they’re crucial for cultural reasons.

For now, Garcia says the animals can be bred slowly and there’s no exact timeline for when they can be reintroduced to the wild. The researchers must make sure the species can thrive in captivity before they begin slowly releasing a few individuals to see how they fare outdoors. (Related: “Watch How Bizarre ‘Water Monsters’ Get a Second Chance”)

“It will take at least a good year, if not two. After a year, we will have a better feeling,” Garcia says. “2020 will potentially be the beginning of trial releases.”",Nuns Resurrect Endangered Salamanders in First-of-its-Kind Conservation Effort,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE4LzA2L3NhbGFtYW5kZXItY29uc2VydmF0aW9uLW51bnMtbWV4aWNvLWFuaW1hbHMv0gFzaHR0cHM6Ly9hcGkubmF0aW9uYWxnZW9ncmFwaGljLmNvbS9kaXN0cmlidXRpb24vcHVibGljL2FtcC9uZXdzLzIwMTgvMDYvc2FsYW1hbmRlci1jb25zZXJ2YXRpb24tbnVucy1tZXhpY28tYW5pbWFscw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://pmdvod.nationalgeographic.com/NG_Video/551/947/smpost_1529425813333.jpg,2018-06-19,"{'sent': 'Lake Pátzcuaro, the third largest lake in Mexico, lies a little more than 200 miles west of Mexico City.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Mexico', 'Mexico City'], 'QUANTITY': ['200 miles']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"Pangolins in eastern China have lost half their habitat in recent decades due to humans moving in to hunt them for meat and scales.

The “scaly anteaters” have been driven into an ever-smaller patch of land since the 1970s and are now confined largely to the Wuyi mountain range.

In the first study to look at long-term population changes for these threatened animals in China, a team of scientists has set out a strategy to preserve them in their remaining habitat.

Pangolins are the most illegally trafficked mammals in the world, with meat prized as a delicacy in China and Vietnam and scales considered a delicacy in traditional Asian medicine.

Those who subscribe to such beliefs think the scales have the power to cure all sorts of diseases including asthma and arthritis.

While the researchers considered the potential impact climate change might have had on the pangolins’ retreat to higher altitudes, they concluded that human activity was by far the biggest factor.

In their paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the researchers noted that pangolins were being pushed into the mountains as human communities expanded across the lowlands.

They used local historical documents to assemble a long-term record of pangolin populations in region and how they had changed over nearly five decades.

As better transport links have been developed in these low-lying regions, the trade in pangolins has seen a boost due to the ease of transporting live animals across the country for consumption.

“Pangolin’s passive defence strategy in dealing with human hunting has provided convenience for human hunting,” the authors noted.

The trade in pangolins is illegal, but rising demand and prices combined with widespread local poverty have been a deadly combination for these animals.

While all eight species of these unusual mammals are threatened with extinction, the scientists said there was hope for the Chinese pangolin.

“Environmental protection programmes in China may have positive impacts on pangolin populations,” the authors explained. “The rate of decrease has been dropping since several environmental protection programmes were launched in the late 1980s, such as the PRC Law on the Protection of Wildlife, the Natural Forests Protection Program and establishing nature reserves.”

To preserve the region’s remaining pangolins, they identified a range of priority areas for conservation in China, including 18 nature reserves and 46 prefectures.

As the trade in pangolin parts is so engrained in traditional culture, the scientists urged a range of measures that considered their protection a social issue as well as a conservation issue.

0,"Pangolins, a type of scaly anteater considered the world's most trafficked wild mammal, have lost more than 50 percent of their range in eastern China, according to a study published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Researchers from Beijing Forestry University, the Zoological Society of London and Imperial College, London focused on Chinese pangolins (Manis pentadactyla), which the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species lists as a critically endangered species, and found that their range had shrunk by 52.2 percent in eastern China between 1970 and 2016.

There are eight species of pangolins in Africa and Asia and they are hunted on both continents for food and for their unique scales, which are used in medicines, according to BBC News.

The Chinese pangolin can be found from Nepal's Himalayan foothills, then south through southern China to Taiwan and Hong Kong.

In response to their findings, the scientists urged the Chinese government to step up their conservation efforts of the mammals.

""Pangolins have been listed in the list of China's state key protected wild animals as level II,"" study authors Li Yang, Xiaofeng Luan and Minhao Chen of Beijing Forestry University told BBC News. ""According to our research and previous research, we suggest that [the] protection level should change into level I.""

The researchers used local historical documents, fauna records, scientific surveys from nature reserves, newspapers and scientific articles to assess changes to the Chinese pangolin's range in eastern China.

While the animals roamed more than 30.41 percent of eastern China in the 1970s, by the 2000s their range had shrunken to mountainous areas, especially the Wuyi Mountains.

The researchers also assessed the relative influence of climate change and human encroachment or poaching on the changes in range and found that direct human actions like poaching were responsible for its dramatic shrinking, according to Phys.org.

In fact, the researchers found that as the pangolin's range declined, their preferred habitats also increased in elevation, suggesting that they were fleeing the development of roads at lower altitudes that made it easier for humans to transport captured animals.

The researchers also made recommendations for how governments and communities could protect the animals on a local and regional level.

They suggested creating or expanding nature reserves and engaging local governments and communities in pangolin conservation efforts.

They noted that only 5.62 percent of the 51,268.4 square kilometers (approximately 19,794.8 square miles) that their research determined was the primary conservation area for pangolins was covered by existing reserves.",World’s Most Trafficked Mammal Lost More Than Half Its Range in Eastern China,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb3dhdGNoLmNvbS93b3JsZHMtbW9zdC10cmFmZmlja2VkLW1hbW1hbC1wYW5nb2xpbnMtMjU5ODIyMzU4MS5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZWNvd2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC93b3JsZHMtbW9zdC10cmFmZmlja2VkLW1hbW1hbC1wYW5nb2xpbnMtMjU5ODIyMzU4MQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xODM0MzAxNS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTYyMTAwNDc4MX0.TYQq0Io5jYw-APrm8mAKmjcBy6rx_gcEIJdThYKfShw/img.jpg?width=1200&coordinates=0%2C15%2C0%2C15&height=600,2018-08-23,"{'sent': ""Pangolins, a type of scaly anteater considered the world's most trafficked wild mammal, have lost more than 50 percent of their range in eastern China, according to a study published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\n"", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Proceedings', 'China']}}",Pangolin
0,"A pair of Japanese giant salamanders at the Honolulu Zoo are making history — and babies.

The salamanders, endemic to Japan and considered a national treasure there, have — for the first time outside of Japan — laid and fertilized eggs, called Hanzaki eggs.

“It is an honor to have the Japanese giant salamanders at the Honolulu Zoo and to be part of the conservation program,” said Honolulu Zoo Director Linda Santos in a news release today. “We are very pleased to have gotten this far in the breeding program. Even if these eggs are not successful we are proud of our staff’s accomplishments in getting the animals to feel comfortable in their habitat to breed, and at a very early age for these animals. We are patiently waiting as the excitement builds to hopefully develop larvae and hatch out new salamanders.”

Zookeepers observed the female salamander in the process of laying her eggs in one of the dens of the habitat on the morning of Sept. 29. Zookeepers then observed the male appearing to fertilize the eggs.

Honolulu’s salamanders — Panda and Maru, both females, and Peace, a male — were gifted to Honolulu Zoo by the Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park and debuted in February at the new Ectotherm Complex.

Peace, 11, and Panda, 13, share a tank and are the breeding pair. Maru, 13, is in her own tank.

There are only four other zoos in the U.S. with Japanese giant salamanders, which can grow to about 5 feet in length and are considered the second largest salamander in the world, behind the Chinese giant salamander.

Shinji Minami, director of the Hiroshima City Asa Zoological Park, said in a statement that the breeding is “epoch-making” because of the pair’s young age and it’s the “first breeding in the world other than Japan.”

The female typically selects a den and lays her eggs, and then the male den master fertilizes the eggs, tends to them, and protects them, according to Honolulu Zoo. The gestation period is 40 to 90 days, and the cooler the water, the slower the egg development. Honolulu Zoo’s water temperature is on the cooler side at 62 degrees Fahrenheit, so the eggs are anticipated to hatch in early December.",Breeding pair of Japanese giant salamanders make history in Honolulu,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXJhZHZlcnRpc2VyLmNvbS8yMDE4LzExLzA5L2hhd2FpaS1uZXdzL2JyZWVkaW5nLXBhaXItb2YtamFwYW5lc2UtZ2lhbnQtc2FsYW1hbmRlcnMtbWFrZS1oaXN0b3J5LWluLWhvbm9sdWx1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/web1_IMG_7795.jpg,2018-11-10,"{'sent': 'The salamanders, endemic to Japan and considered a national treasure there, have — for the first time outside of Japan — laid and fertilized eggs, called Hanzaki eggs.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Japan'], 'ORG': ['Hanzaki']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"Until recently, the habits and habitats of the Bengal florican remained a mystery: males were easily seen in their seasonally flooded grassland habitat during the breeding season but effectively disappeared for half the year.

Researchers in India and Nepal combined field surveys, satellite telemetry and remote sensing to model the distribution and assess the critically endangered bird’s movements, survival and home ranges.

After years of not knowing the birds’ non-breeding whereabouts, the study found that Bengal floricans leave their protected, seasonally flooded breeding areas in favor of unprotected low-intensity agricultural fields and other upland grasslands during their non-breeding season.

KATHMANDU, Nepal — As dawn peeks through the morning mist on an early spring day in Nepal’s Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, a duck-sized bird flaps its wings and throws itself into the air as if it were jumping on a trampoline.

The critically endangered Bengal florican, known for the signature display of its males during the breeding season, can be spotted inside protected grasslands in Nepal and India from early spring until the monsoon sets in around June or July. After that, they vanish.

Until recently, the habits and habitat of the Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) here in the Indian subcontinent remained a mystery, even for those who knew the bird.”I roamed the national parks for decades, but even I did not know where the Bengal floricans went after June/July,” said Narendra Man Babu Pradhan, former warden of Chitwan National Park in Nepal and co-author of a recent study of the birds in India and Nepal. When it’s not resbreeding season, he says, the birds “effectively disappear.”

The Bengal florican, a type of bustard, is a mysterious species in several ways. It occurs in two separate regions: one subspecies (H.b. blandini) lives in Cambodia’s seasonally flooded Tonle Sap region, and the other (H.b. bengalensis) lives in the alluvial grasslands of southern Nepal and northern India, called the Terai.

Individuals of the more extensively studied Cambodian subspecies leave their flooded breeding habitat during the non-breeding season for grassy and lightly wooded areas. But the grasslands of the Terai don’t flood for long periods during the monsoon. So why do the South Asian Bengal floricans leave the protected areas when it starts to rain?

The global Bengal florican population now stands at fewer than 1,000 individuals, and its elusive movements have hindered conservation managers’ understanding of its distribution and ability to develop appropriate conservation solutions. A group of scientists from India and Nepal, with support from the U.K.-government-funded Darwin Initiative, began studying the florican’s movements in 2012.

“We used a combination of field surveys, satellite telemetry and remote sensing to model the distribution and assess the movements, survival and home ranges,” said Rohit Jha, the study’s lead author.

Jha and his colleagues captured 11 floricans, from four protected areas in Nepal and one in India, to fit the birds with Argos Doppler tags. These tags send periodic location signals to polar-orbiting satellites.

They also conducted field surveys in both countries and used the results to develop distribution models to identify possible new populations. Surveying swaths of tall grasslands where Bengal tigers roam was risky. “For that, we had to climb trees or get on watch towers,” Jha said.

But crouching tigers and hidden rhinos were not their main obstacles in tracking the floricans. “The main challenge we faced was in capturing the birds,” Pradhan said. The researchers consulted Ali Hussain, a legendary Indian bird trapper. “Ali Hussain was successful in capturing the birds in a short time using his indigenous traps, and we could [then] tag the birds,” Jha said.

Tracking seasonal movements

Argos satellites collect data transmitted by each tag and measure the frequency of the signals they receive. The satellites relay the data and signal frequency, which changes as the satellite approaches or moves away from a tag, to processing centers. There, computers calculate the tagged birds’ locations by measuring the Doppler shifts — the change in the receiving frequency — of the signals, which is accurate to within 150 meters (492 feet).

“The location estimates from tags are less accurate than those made by GPS units,” Jha said, “but the tags are lighter than GPS units,” enabling birds to carry them without hindering flight.

The tags, powered by solar panels, carried three sensors: one each to record temperature, battery voltage, and movement. “Fortunately, Bengal floricans are relatively heavy — the average weight of birds caught was 1.4 kilograms [3.1 pounds],” Jha said. “A rule of thumb says that the tag should weigh less than 4 percent of the body weight. Our tags were 30 grams [roughly 1 ounce] — well below the 4 percent,” he added.

The researchers, who sighted the birds repeatedly, found that even with the tags the birds moved and foraged freely. “We also made optimum use of the battery so that we could keep receiving data from the tagged birds for a long period of time, as the area we worked in receives adequate sunlight throughout the year,” Jha said.

The researchers programmed the tags to remain active for 10 hours and then switch off for 24 hours. “The approach helped us conserve the batteries and provide enough time for recharging the solar panel,” Jha said. Some of the tags are still running into their fifth year.

The species distribution models suggested that while the floricans’ distribution is fragmented in the western Terai, sizeable undiscovered populations might exist in eastern parts of the species’ range, particularly along the Brahmaputra River. The models also suggested that some areas become unsuitable after breeding season, which may force the birds to leave protected areas.

The tagged birds told a similar story. “We found out that after breeding, the tagged birds left their breeding sites inside protected areas,” Jha said, “and moved up to 80 kilometers [50 miles] into landscapes characterized by relatively low-intensity agriculture along rivers with lower-than-average human population densities. Many birds spent more than six months away from their breeding grounds.”

Why do Bengal floricans leave protected areas after breeding?

Ornithologist Hem Sagar Baral, who has followed the research, said Bengal floricans thrive on “semi-natural” grasslands, created and maintained by various factors.

“It prefers to live on grassland that does not get to grow tall,” Baral said. Grass inside protected areas in the region is cut or set on fire just ahead of the monsoon. “This coincides with the breeding season of the bird, and that is when they come to the protected areas,” Baral added. “But as the monsoon sets in, the grass grows tall again, and the protected areas become unsuitable for Bengal floricans.”

In the past, the grasslands supported large herbivores that grazed on the grass and created suitable habitats for the floricans. “We have seen in protected areas of the subcontinent that the number of large herbivores is not even near the historical numbers,” Baral said.

“People used to venture into the grasslands to get fodder for their cattle, and that would also maintain the habitat of the birds,” Baral said. “But such activities are not allowed inside protected areas now.” Bengal floricans find suitably short grassland near the protected areas on riverbanks and in agricultural areas, which puts them at risk. “In certain parts of the region, bustards are considered game birds and are eaten by humans,” Pradhan said.

Do the birds travel to Cambodia? No.

“There was a hypothesis,” Jha said, “that during the non-breeding season, the birds migrate to Cambodia. But this study conclusively proves otherwise.”

What surprised the researchers was how “site-faithful” the tagged birds were. “We found that the male birds would return to not only the same area, but also near the same spot where they were displaying during previous breeding seasons,” said co-author Jyotendra Jyu Thakuri, who coordinated the study in Nepal.

In fact, floricans from Pilibhit Tiger Reserve in India and Shuklaphanta National Park in Nepal that shared non-breeding habitat repeatedly returned to their own reserves during the breeding season, Pradhan said. “The site-faithfulness makes the birds’ movements very predictable for poachers and predators,” he added, “and maybe this is one of the reasons they are declining in number.”

The key finding from the study was that Bengal floricans use habitats outside of protected areas, Baral said. “However, we cannot say that all Bengal floricans leave protected areas,” he added, “the sample size of the study is not adequate.”

Baral said the study was a somber reminder that only a handful of Bengal floricans remain and that we might lose them soon if action is not taken to conserve them.

The Nepalese government has formulated a Bengal Florican Conservation Action Plan (2016-2020) to maintain a healthy and viable population of the birds by increasing the area of high-quality habitat and applying a better understanding of its ecology to reduce threats, Thakuri said. But since the plan’s completion in 2016, little has been done to save the Bengal floricans, Baral said. He added that enough studies had been carried out, and now was the time to act, and act fast, to save the birds.

0,"There have been whispers for decades that a creature with the spots of a leopard and the body of an eel lurked in the swamps of Florida and Alabama. Rumor had it the animal was as long as a man’s arm, with glistening gray skin, and frills on either side of its face.

But unlike Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster, this animal is real. And today scientists have given it a name: the reticulated siren.

“It was basically this mythical beast,” says David Steen, a wildlife ecologist at the Georgia Sea Turtle Center and co-author of a paper officially describing the new species published December 5 in the journal PLOS ONE. Informally, people have called it the leopard eel, though it is clearly not an eel (and zero parts big cat).

Sirens are among the world’s largest salamanders—and this species, also known as scientifically as Siren reticulata, grows up to two feet in length. Like other members of the Sirenidae family, these creatures are completely aquatic, Steen says.

Unlike most salamanders, sirens have lost their hindlimbs through millions of years of evolution. They wear their gills on the outside, which absorb oxygen from water in the murky ecosystems they inhabit. Sirens also lack eyelids and sport tiny, horny beaks instead of teeth.

The new species is one of the largest creatures to be described in the United States in over 100 years. And it could have gone longer. Steen says it took about five years of searching ponds and waterways in the Florida panhandle before they could come up with enough specimens to describe the species.

These are animals that spend their entire lives below the surface, and they apparently like turbid water that makes observations extremely difficult. Not much else is known about the new species, though it’s thought to feed on things like insects and mollusks.

“What immediately jumps out about the reticulated siren that makes it so different from currently-recognized species is its dark and reticulated [or net-like] pattern,” says Steen. “It also seems as though they have a disproportionally-smaller head, as compared to other sirens.”

Own dime, own time

Steen captured his first reticulated siren in a minnow trap at the Eglin Air Force Base in Florida in 2009. It was the first time the species had been seen by a researcher, apart from a few museum specimens collected in the 1970s.

When Steen first held a reticulated siren in his hands, he says he spent a long moment in “stunned silence.”

He and first author Sean Graham, now a vertebrate zoologist at Sul Ross State University in Texas, had been searching for the creature on and off for several years as they completed their PhDs at Auburn University in Alabama. At the time, just four siren species had been described by scientists, though some notes in the backs of books suggested there was at least one more—a spotted siren that didn’t seem to fit with the other known species.

They had no official funding. The search for the mystery salamander was little more than a passion project—something the duo pursued on their own time and on their own dime, says Steen.

Unfortunately for Graham, he wasn’t there for that first capture. But he traveled to Florida as soon as Steen told him he’d caught a specimen. Upon seeing it, he was thrilled. “To say he was excited would be an understatement,” Steen says.

The long road to discovery

While the official description of the reticulated siren will be news to most of the world, for the scientists who study amphibians, this moment has been eagerly awaited.

“It was a long time coming,” says Jennifer Stabile, an associate research scientist with Field Projects International, a company that helps teach students in the sciences how to do field work. “People had been discussing this for decades, how these groups needed to be looked at because we knew that there were more species there than had been documented.”

Earlier in her career, Stabile was part of a team that discovered that two other siren species, the greater siren and southern dwarf siren, will actually go out of their way to eat plants. (Prior to this, it was believed the animals only ate invertebrates.) She is also one of only a handful of people on the planet who have successfully bred sirens in captivity.

“So when I saw that this paper had been published, I was super stoked,” says Stabile. “I’ll never forget the first [greater siren] that I caught in a minnow trap, because they’re huge!”

At Least Five New Giant Salamander Species Identified Researchers have found that there is not one, but at least five species of Chinese giant salamander, and possibly up to eight.

Alexander Kupfer, a vertebrate zoologist and herpetologist at the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart in Germany, echoed those sentiments. “The sirens are a group of salamanders which have always been a bit underestimated in terms of species numbers,” he says.

Thus, it makes sense that there would be undescribed species such as this one right under our noses, says Kupfer, who discovered that the males in some siren species, such as the lesser siren, appear to practice paternal care in the form of egg-guarding.

The discovery is just the beginning of the road for researchers, since we still know very little. Do the reticulated siren males guard their eggs as lesser sirens do? And how many other species might be out there?",New species of giant salamander discovered in Florida,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEE02vQWn03xTOndLPNA-ADoqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowmrWECzDc_IADMP7SgwY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2018/11/new-salamander-species/01-new-salamander-species-b5h-oino.ngsversion.1544036443209.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2018-12-05,"{'sent': 'There have been whispers for decades that a creature with the spots of a leopard and the body of an eel lurked in the swamps of Florida and Alabama.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Alabama', 'Florida']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"The Chinese pangolin is a scale-covered mammal that resembles an armadillo in appearance and an anteater in behavior, though it is more closely related to bears and cats than anteaters.

Once found in forests and grasslands across southern China, parts of Southeast Asia, and into India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, poaching and trafficking have left the Chinese pangolin critically endangered. Despite protections, in some parts of Asia, including China and Vietnam, pangolin meat is considered a delicacy and its scales are used in traditional medicine, despite no evidence that the scales cure anything.

All of the four Asian species of pangolin are endangered or critically endangered, so poachers are setting their sights on the four African species to fill demand. All of those species are listed as vulnerable.

Behavior

Like its pangolin relatives, the Chinese pangolin has no defense against humans—not even teeth—and its underside is soft and unprotected. Some poachers use dogs to find pangolins in their burrows and dig them out. When threatened by predators such as big cats, the pangolin quickly rolls into a tight, scale-covered ball.

Chinese pangolins are nocturnal, solitary animals that spend most of their time on the ground, but they are also good climbers. During the day they stay in the burrows they’ve dug out with their long front claws—often next to ant or termite mounds—or in passageways vacated by termites. The pangolins might also be the reason those passageways are empty: Termites and ants make up 100 percent of the pangolin’s diet.

After dark, pangolins head out to feed, finding an ant colony or termite mound that looks tasty. Digging into it with its efficient claws, the pangolin sticks in its snout and laps up the insects with its very long and very sticky tongue, eating thousands of insects in one day. When the ants swarm, the scales protect the pangolin from bites, and the ability to close off its nose and ears, as well as thick eyelids, help it deal with its stinging snack.

Reproduction

Pangolins live alone except when it comes time to mate. Females typically bear a single offspring at a time; Chinese pangolin males, which are much bigger than the females, stay with the family until the baby is weaned. A baby pangolin will ride on its mother’s back or tail from about a month old, after its scales harden, nursing and eating ants. Young stay with their mothers for about two years—when they become sexually mature—before heading off to start their own families.",Chinese Pangolin,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vYW5pbWFscy9tYW1tYWxzL2MvY2hpbmVzZS1wYW5nb2xpbi_SAV1odHRwczovL2FwaS5uYXRpb25hbGdlb2dyYXBoaWMuY29tL2Rpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi9wdWJsaWMvYW1wL2FuaW1hbHMvbWFtbWFscy9jL2NoaW5lc2UtcGFuZ29saW4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/thumbs/rights-exempt/invertebrates/c/chinese-pangolin.ngsversion.1544496343316.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2018-12-19,"{'sent': 'Once found in forests and grasslands across southern China, parts of Southeast Asia, and into India, Bangladesh, and Nepal, poaching and trafficking have left the Chinese pangolin critically endangered.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China', 'India', 'Bangladesh', 'Nepal']}}",Pangolin
0,"On The Great Indian Nature Trail! On The Great Indian Nature Trail!

What happens when you ask an ornithologist, a wildlife photographer and a dog to “duck”? They will all perk up and ask “Where? Which one?” Here are some facts about Indian wildlife from The Great Indian Nature Trail With Uncle Bikky, a comic book about one such wildlife mad trio.

Pretty pawsome

Sloth bears are only found in the Indian subcontinent! Sloth bears are so pawsome that even a tiger would never want to get in a fight with them.

One, they are expert tree climbers.

Two, have you seen their sharp claws? They may not be able to hear or see that well, but bears have an incredible sense of smell. Mama bears are fiercely protective of their cubs. In fact, they have been known to scare tigers away!

Third, Sloth Bears can close their nostrils completely—okay, okay, that has nothing to do with them winning a fight, but how cool is that?

Jump like a florican

The Bengal Florican is one cool bird. If you visit Dudhwa between March to June, you may get lucky enough to spot the show that the male birds put on during the breeding season. The male florican will fly almost 10 feet up into the air, then come down, and fly up again and then whoosh, dive to the ground, all the while clapping its wings and calling “chikchikchik”.

(Pro tip: If you are watching this, you do not clap and frighten them away)

SOS: Danger Alert

The Godavan in trouble!

Godavan is the local name for the Great Indian Bustard. Once a common sight in this landscape, the Great Indian Bustard is now critically endangered. Where once people could see flocks of over 20 birds, now one sees only two or three individuals. In fact, the species once lived across Central, Western and South India and parts of Pakistan. Today, it can be found only in small populations in Rajasthan, and in very small populations in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Hunting and the dwindling of grasslands are the reason behind drastic reduction in population. And this is the species that represents the health of the grasslands it lives in.

Ghost cat

The snow leopard is so elusive that it is called the ghost cat or the grey ghost. So much so, that even the conservationists who work in the region haven’t sighted this cat often.

According to WWF, snow leopards are found in 12 countries, including China, Bhutan, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Russia and Mongolia.

They use their thick tails to balance on the rocks. And it comes in handy to wrap around and hug them when it’s too cold.

Snow leopards are agile climbers and can leap for as far as 50 feet!

Sadly, the Snow Leopard is in lots of trouble. Poaching, habitat loss and climate change are some of the biggest threats this species faces. In fact, research indicates that climate change can mean a loss of about 30% of their habitat in Himalayas.

Show your stripes

They are fascinating creatures—just like no two fingerprints are alike, no two tigers have the same stripes. According to researchers, “a lion’s or a tiger’s roar can reach 114 decibels to someone standing a few feet away, which is about 25 times louder than a gas lawn mower.”

A rare salamander found in Coventry after smugglers tried to import him is now on show at London Zoo.

Smugglers attempted to import the animal from Hong Kong in a cereal box but it was found at a postal hub in Coventry in September 2016.

The Chinese giant salamander was one of five critically endangered amphibians found in the box, one of which had already died by the time authorities discovered them.

London Zoo looked after the remaining four and one is now set to go on display to the public from today.

(Image: London Zoo)

Professor Lew, as he is now called, is thought to be around four years old and measures 30cm in length - but keepers predict he could grow up to 1.8 meters.

The species is facing extinction after becoming a highly coveted delicacy in their native country of China.

'Giant brown blob'

Ben Tapley, the Zoological Society of London's curator of amphibians, said: ""We work closely with Border Force to identify unusual animals, but even I was astonished to see that they were Chinese giant salamanders - one of the world's most critically endangered amphibians.

""Chinese giant salamanders may not be everyone's idea of beautiful - I've heard them described as giant brown blobs with eyes - but Professor Lew's crinkly purple tail and slimy smile have already made the newcomer a big hit with all our keepers, who have been finding any excuse to visit the Reptile House.

“They’re definitely unique: often referred to as living fossils, Chinese giant salamanders have remained largely unchanged for millions of years - as the only zoo in the country to have one in residence it’s a real privilege to be able to introduce the species to our visitors.”

(Image: London Zoo)

The three other seized salamanders are being looked after behind-the-scenes and keepers will eventually introduce one of the group to Professor Lew as a mate.

The remaining two may then move to other zoos in the UK, as the species are highly territorial and need to be housed in separate enclosures.

New home

Professor Lew has moved into a state-of-the-art tank in the zoo’s Reptile House, giving visitors the chance to come face to face with one of nature’s giants.

His new home is three metres in length and took six months to build.

It was designed to replicate the salamander’s wild environment in the mountainous regions of China.

Chinese giant salamanders are thought to have inspired dragon legends and even China's iconic yin-yang motif.

0,"The Chinese giant salamander, the largest amphibian in the world, is not cute.

Weighing as much as an adult human, it has slimy brown skin, a giant mouth curled to a gormless grin, and puny, mistrustful eyes.

It is also one of the world's most endangered species.

And yet, unlike its compatriot the giant panda, the giant salamander rarely makes the news.

Why do some animals strike a chord with humans, prompting them to donate millions towards their conservation, while others draw little more than disgust?

And is a sad-eyed panda really worth saving more than a slimy salamander?

Size, intelligence, behavior, rarity, how closely an animal resembles the human form -- all play a part in our reaction to various endangered creatures.

""One of the biggest factors is 'cuteness': physical characteristics such as big eyes and soft features that elicit our parental instincts because they remind us of human infants,"" Hal Herzog, emeritus professor at West Carolina University's Department of Psychology, told AFP.

An expert in human-animal relationships, Herzog said the dark rings around pandas' eyes triggered humans nurturing instincts.

""Compare that to the Chinese giant salamander,"" he said. ""Google it. It looks like a six-foot-long, 150-pound bag of brown slime with beady little eyes.""

The salamanders are a vital part of their ecosystem, just as worms are essential to soil health around the steams and lakes they live in -- which is just about everywhere.

Yet, like maggots, rats and snakes, the main instinct they inspire in humans is revulsion.

'Learned' disgust

According to Graham Davey, a specialist in phobias from the University of Sussex's School of Psychology, we learn to revile certain creatures at a young age.

""Disgust is a learned emotion. Babies are not born with it... it's probably transmitted socially, culturally and within families,"" he said.

Some animals are reviled due to their resemblance to ""primary disgusting things"" such as mucus or feces, Davey said, while others are perceived -- rightly or wrongly -- to pose a direct danger to the beholder.

""In terms of threat to humankind, disease and illness are bigger than being attacked by an animal,"" he said.

This might explain why most of us don't find lions and bears repellant -- they are covered with the same type of soft fur that coat cuddly toys for children, even if it might be better to avoid one in real life.

An orca by any other name

As with most things, popular culture has a huge effect on how society perceives animals.

Whereas the movie ""Free Willy"" prompted a wave of sympathy for the protection of endangered orcas, ""Arachnophobia"" hardly helped spiders' cause.

See also: ""Jaws"" for sharks.

Even the depiction of fictional creatures can have a knock-on effect on public perception towards certain animals.

Take the main being in ""Alien"", for example.

""Seeing the one from the first film that had that mucus-y drawl dripping from the alien's mouth... sensitises people to disgusting things,"" Davey said.

Nor is it just the public at large who are liable to ""speciesism"", or discrimination against other species in favour of our own.

A study in 2017 found a strong correlation between society's preferred animals and those most studied in scientific research.

""Maybe that's because it's easier to get money"" to study well-known animals, said Frederic Legendre, a researcher at France's National History Museum.

And popular species make money in return, according to Christo Fabricius from WWF -- a conservation group indelibly linked to its panda logo.

""Reptiles, for example, are not very marketable,"" he said.

'Protect species, protect habitat'

Not that favoring certain cute or charismatic species is necessarily a bad thing for conservation.

""When we protect an iconic species, we protect their habitat and therefore all the organisms within it also benefit,"" said Legendre.

But such species can become a victim of their own popularity.

One recent study suggested that a ""virtual"" presence of wild animals such as elephants and tigers -- be that on computer screens, T-shirts or in children's books -- can fool people into thinking they are more common in the wild than they really are.

The populations of most megafauna -- from hippos to giraffes and gorillas -- remain in peril.

Then there's the risk of poaching.

The rarer the species ""the more value they provide for traditional medicine, for trophy hunting, and therefore they are poached more often,"" said Franck Courchamp, an ecologist at France's National Centre for Scientific Research.

The Chinese giant salamander, the largest amphibian in the world, is not cute. Weighing as much as an adult human, it has slimy brown skin, a giant mouth curled to a gormless grin, and puny, mistrustful eyes. It is also one of the world’s most endangered species. And yet, unlike its compatriot the giant panda, the giant salamander rarely makes the news.

Why do some animals strike a chord with humans, prompting them to donate millions towards their conservation, while others draw little more than disgust?

And is a sad-eyed panda really worth saving more than a slimy salamander?

Size, intelligence, behaviour, rarity, how closely an animal resembles the human form -- all play a part in our reaction to various endangered creatures.

“One of the biggest factors is ‘cuteness’: physical characteristics such as big eyes and soft features that elicit our parental instincts because they remind us of human infants,” Hal Herzog, emeritus professor at West Carolina University’s Department of Psychology, told AFP.

Concerns on the declining population of Bengal Florican. WCS

The population of Bengal Florican in Cambodia has declined since 2012, according to a survey conducted by Ministry of Environment and Wildlife Conservation Society.

The WCS issued a release on Monday, saying that conservationists estimate that the number of Bengal Florican or displaying males in 2018 was only 104, down from 216 in 2012. The displaying males were found at only four sites, down from 10 in 2012, it said.

The findings, which were recently published in the journal Bird Conservation International, showed that the population of Bengal florican in Southeast Asia has declined by 55 percent since 2012, it said.

The Bengal Florican is considered critically endangered by IUCN and is now almost entirely restricted to the Tonle Sap floodplain, it said.

The WCS said that in 2018, a total of population of adult Bengal Floricans in Cambodia was estimated at 138 and males outnumber females 3:1.

WCS’s Technical Advisor Sum Phearun said that protecting flooded grassland is instrumental in saving its population,

“Protecting inundated natural grassland in the Tonle Sap floodplains is the key action to ensure species recovery and its long-term survival,” Mr Phearun said.

The WCS said that the survey indicated that the population was stable at Stoung Chikreang in the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape where community-based conservation implemented by the Ministry of Environment and supported by WCS.",Bengal Florican population declines,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtobWVydGltZXNraC5jb20vNjEzNDQ2L2JlbmdhbC1mbG9yaWNhbi1wb3B1bGF0aW9uLWRlY2xpbmVzLXdjcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.khmertimeskh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bengal-Florican.jpg,2019-06-12,"{'sent': 'Bengal Florican population declines\n\nConcerns on the declining population of Bengal Florican.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Bengal Florican'], 'GPE': ['Bengal Florican']}}",Bengal Florican

Cambodia's population of Bengal Florican has sharply declined since 2012 according to a recent survey conducted by Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Cambodia's Ministry of Environment.

The findings, which were recently published in the journal Bird Conservation International, showed that the population of Bengal Florican across South-East Asia has declined by 55 per cent since 2012. Conservationists now estimate that the number of displaying males in Cambodia in 2018 was merely 104, down from 216 in 2012. Displaying males were found at only four sites, down from 10 in 2012.



Bengal Florican has suffered a steep decline since 2012, with some 138 adults estimated remain in 2018 (Nejib Ahmed / wikimedia.commons.org).

Bengal Florican is listed as Critically Endangered by IUCN. The subspecies blandini is now almost entirely restricted to the Tonle Sap Floodplain, Cambodia. WCS and the Ministry of Environment (MoE) monitor 80 per cent of the population each year, but this is only the third time that the whole population has been surveyed.

The total population of adult Bengal Floricans in Cambodia in 2018 was estimated at 138, with males outnumbering females 3:1. However, despite the bleak statistics the survey indicated that the population was stable at Stoung-Chikreang in the Northern Tonle Sap Protected Landscape, where community-based conservation has been implemented by the Ministry of Environment.

Hong Chamnan, Deputy Director at the Department of Freshwater Wetlands Conservation, Ministry of Environment, said: ""Our Bengal Florican conservation at Stoung-Chikreang has been a big success; credit goes to the Department of Freshwater Wetlands Conservation, Kompong Thom Provincial Department of Environment and the Community Management Committees.

The Wildlife Conservation Society yesterday called on the government to take strong measures to prevent illegal wildlife trade, noting that traffickers are using Cambodia as a transit country to export wildlife products from African to Asian markets.

WCS and the Club of Cambodian Journalists yesterday held a workshop in Phnom Penh on the role of the media in responding to wildlife trafficking and to foster greater awareness among the public that wildlife trafficking is a serious crime which needs to be tackled.

Ken Sereyrotha, country director of WCS, said that according to research by the United Nations Environment Programme, illegal wildlife trade is a serious crime, involving billions of dollars and is related to money laundering.

“The income generated from wildlife trade is laundered and used to finance activities, including terrorism, which cause instability in some countries,” he said. “I think income received from illegal wildlife trade is laundered by buying land, property or other assets.”

“We are concerned that national security will be affected if there is no immediate action to curb illegal wildlife trade,” Mr Sereyrotha added.

He said that Cambodia is among countries traffickers use as a transit point to distribute wildlife parts and products from Africa to other Asian countries, noting that a huge haul of ivory was seized in Sihanoukville Autonomous Port.

“Cambodia isn’t designated as a place for trafficking of illegal wildlife but as transit country in order to supply markets in Asia,” Mr Sereyrotha noted.

He appealed to the government to take stronger measures to tackle the scourge, including stricter enforcement.

In 2014, Cambodia seized about three tonnes of ivory, including rhinoceros horns, which were discovered by Sihanoukville customs officials hidden in two containers storing beans.

Sarah Brook, technical advisor at WCS, yesterday said that as Asian wildlife species are declining in numbers, wildlife traffickers are sourcing parts from Africa and Latin America to supply the huge market in Asia.

“The country is stated as being a transition point for illegal shipment of ivory from Africa,” she said, noting that WCS is committed to disrupting wildlife trade and that government agencies must follow up its efforts by investigating cases which are uncovered and taking action against those responsible.

“We will succeed in our mission when criminals behind illegal wildlife trade have been brought to justice,” Ms Brook noted.

She added that there are other countries besides Cambodia which are being used as transit points for illegal wildlife trade.

“I think that over the past six years we have not seen any shipments of ivory coming through Cambodia because they are being sent straight to Vietnam or elsewhere after the government started stricter enforcement against traffickers,” Ms Brook said.

Neth Pheaktra, Environment Ministry spokesman, yesterday said that the government is committed to combating illegal wildlife trade and Cambodia as a UN member state is ready to cooperate internationally with all countries in the conservation of natural resources and preventing or combating illegal wildlife trafficking.

“Cambodia has been actively involved in the fight against illegal wildlife trafficking, and it has collaborated with international partners in helping to prevent illegal wildlife trade,” he said.",More action against wildlife trafficking needed: WCS,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtobWVydGltZXNraC5jb20vNjI2NjYyL21vcmUtYWN0aW9uLWFnYWluc3Qtd2lsZGxpZmUtdHJhZmZpY2tpbmctbmVlZGVkLXdjcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.khmertimeskh.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/use-this-1-ivories-seized-at-PP-Port-7.jpg,2019-07-23,"{'sent': 'More action against wildlife trafficking needed: WCS\n\nOfficials document a haul of ivory seized at a dry port in Phnom Penh in 2017.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Phnom Penh']}}",Chinese Crocodile Lizard

Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) have always been oddballs in the reptile world. Their unusual cardiovascular system and their uniquely powerful sense of smell help them hunt—and find mates—more easily than other lizard species. Now, scientists know why, thanks to the first-ever sequencing of the Komodo dragon’s genome.

To understand why Komodo dragons are so unique, scientists spent 8 years gathering data and sequencing the genomes of four lizards from four zoos (including Slasher, above, from Zoo Atlanta). They then mapped the evolutionary history of Komodos by comparing their genomes with three birds, four mammals, and 15 reptiles in the Varanidae family, including the Chinese crocodile lizard and the Carolina anole.

Nearly 201 genes stood out, including those that coded for some of the Komodo dragon’s most unusual traits, like their ability to use pheromones to target and ambush prey. Several genes seem to enhance their metabolism, allowing them to process carbohydrates faster for more energy during extended periods of hunting and fighting. The researchers also found genes coding for proteins used in haemostasis, a blood-clotting process that allows the lizards to survive bites from other Komodo dragons, whose saliva contains blood-thinning chemicals, researchers report today in Nature Ecology & Evolution .

Scientists hope their new map of the Komodo dragon genome will not only help them better understand lizards like Slasher, but will also provide a template for researching—and conserving—other lizards in the same family.",How Komodo dragons survive deadly bites from other Komodos,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VtYWcub3JnL25ld3MvMjAxOS8wNy9ob3cta29tb2RvLWRyYWdvbnMtc3Vydml2ZS1kZWFkbHktYml0ZXMtb3RoZXIta29tb2Rvc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/styles/article_main_large/public/dragon_16x9_0.jpg?itok=OStJUzQi,2019-07-29,"{'sent': 'How Komodo dragons survive deadly bites from other Komodos\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Komodo'], 'PERSON': ['Komodos']}}",Chinese Crocodile Lizard
0,"Some have survived for hundreds of millions of years, but many of the world’s freshwater megafauna—including sumo-sized stingrays, colossal catfish, giant turtles, and gargantuan salamanders—may soon find themselves on the brink of extinction, according to a new study published.

For the first time, researchers have quantified the global decline of freshwater megafauna—including fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals—and the results paint a grim picture. In four decades since 1970, the global populations of these freshwater giants have declined by almost 90 percent—twice as much as the loss of vertebrate populations on land or in the oceans.

View Images A black swan swims among koi. Photograph by Tyrone Turner, Nat Geo Image Collection

Large fish species, such as sturgeons, salmons, and giant catfishes, are particularly threatened, with a 94 percent population decline. Most large freshwater reptile and many mammal species are also in trouble. The baiji, a Chinese river dolphin, is likely the first dolphin species driven to extinction by humans, and the Chinese paddlefish, which can grow 20 feet long, has not been seen in over a decade. Other species may be down to their last few individuals.

“This is a crisis of huge proportions that is not widely appreciated” says Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a National Geographic Explorer who has studied the plight of freshwater megafish for two decades.

Hogan, who is a co-author on the study published today in the journal Global Change Biology, says the troubled story of giant fish specifically underscores the environmental crisis that many rivers and lakes around the world face today. “Once the largest animals go, it's a warning that we need to do something quickly to improve the ecosystem health of our rivers and lakes,” he says.

Underwater leviathans

Freshwater ecosystems are generally less studied than their marine counterparts, despite being home to a third of all vertebrate species and nearly half of all fish species worldwide. While population declines have been well-documented for both terrestrial and marine megafauna, few studies of large freshwater species have been conducted on a global scale. (See beautiful underwater photos of overlooked freshwater animals.)

For the study, a team of international researchers compiled population data on 126 out of 207 freshwater species weighing at least 30 kilograms (66 pounds) from 1970 to 2012, drawing in part on The Living Planet Index, a database managed by the Zoological Society of London in cooperation with the World Wildlife Fund. While that index shows that populations of all freshwater species declined by 83 percent during roughly the same period, the new study shows an even higher rate of decline in big freshwater animals, at 88 percent.

The study’s lead author, Fengzhi He, a freshwater ecologist at the Leibniz-Institute for Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in Berlin, says public awareness of the freshwater biodiversity crisis is limited, with many people unaware that the giant creatures even exist. “They are not like tigers, pandas, lions, or whales—species that receive a lot of attention in the media and school education,” he says.

Among the biggest threats facing large freshwater species are overexploitation and habitat degradation, says He. Many of the these animals are targeted for meat, skin, and eggs. Megafish in particular tend to be more vulnerable than other fish to dams that block their migratory routes and limit access to spawning grounds. Large animals also tend to be slow to mature and have low reproduction rates, making them particularly vulnerable. (Read about how critically endangered giant fish are being poached to serve at restaurants.)

Trouble on the Mekong

According to the study, the biogeographic zones that have seen the greatest declines in freshwater megafauna are Indomalaya (99 percent) and the Palearctic, which encompasses Europe, northern Africa, and northern Asia (97 percent). Now, Hogan says, the most critical region may be Southeast Asia, and in particular the Mekong River, which runs through China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. More than a thousand species of freshwater fish live in the Mekong, including many of the world’s largest. The Mekong giant catfish, for example, is the current record-holder for the world’s largest freshwater fish ever caught, at 646 pounds.

Rare freshwater success: Endangered river dolphins' numbers on the rise Efforts to remove fishing gear in the Mekong River over the last decade have helped their numbers grow. Read more.

Hogan says he has not seen a Mekong giant catfish in the wild since 2015. Existing and planned dams on the river may drive the species to extinction. He and other researchers are not sure what the ecological consequences of such fish disappearing will be, but in the case of the Mekong, it could threaten the food security and livelihoods of millions of people living along the river.

Amid the grim overall findings, the study did suggest that 13 freshwater megafauna species have seen their populations stabilize or even grow. Among them are the green sturgeon and the American beaver, both in the United States. In Europe, the Eurasian beaver has returned to many regions from where it had once disappeared, and in Cambodia, the population of Irrawaddy river dolphins has increased for the first time in 20 years.",Earth’s largest freshwater creatures at risk of extinction,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEGAgXoho0oK6XdDjRyge9IgqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowmrWECzDc_IADMKHKngY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2019/08/freshwater-animals-risk-extinction/florida-manatee.ngsversion.1565279455292.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2019-08-08,"{'sent': 'Some have survived for hundreds of millions of years, but many of the world’s freshwater megafauna—including sumo-sized stingrays, colossal catfish, giant turtles, and gargantuan salamanders—may soon find themselves on the brink of extinction, according to a new study published.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['hundreds of millions']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

In downtown Reykjavik, several restaurants catering to tourists offer whale meat. Perhaps they find the idea of doing something that’s illegal back home tempting. Perhaps they believe eating whale is a traditional Icelandic experience. Whatever their reasoning, many tourists will choose to eat whale steak during their Iceland vacation.

But the environment is global, and whether you are acting at home or abroad, what you buy and what you eat can make a difference for endangered and threatened species.

Whale Meat

Icelandic whalers hunt both the endangered fin whale and the minke whale. It’s the minke that usually shows up on menus. Although this species’ population is the most stable of any great whale, it is still listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ).

Statistics are hard to find on how much of Iceland’s whale meat tourists eat. But if locals defend whaling politically, they don’t have much of a taste for the meat. According to one poll, only 1.7 percent of Icelanders eat whale meat at least monthly. The rise of responsible tourism probably contributed to the good news that in 2019, for the first time in 17 years, there will be no whale hunting in Iceland.

Softshell Turtles

The news is not always so positive. In April, the last known female Yangtze giant softshell turtle died in a zoo in Suzhou, China. Once plentiful, softshell turtles, like many other turtle species, are prized as food. Habitat loss and overharvesting have driven the species to the brink of almost certain extinction.

A Global Problem

Females may still exist in the wild. But it has been several years since Chinese scientists had a confirmed sighting of a wild Yangtze giant softshell turtle. In that case, the specimen was eaten before the scientists could arrive on the scene.Turtles are not the only species eaten to extinction. In 2016 an Oxford University professor compiled a list of 301 land mammal species threatened with extinction by human culinary habits. Limited to mammals, that list does not include some of the creatures most affected by the market for exotic foods, including the Chinese giant salamander, Beluga sturgeon, and European eels. Thanks to CITES, most of these species will not be available for sale in the U.S. But travelers should know that just because something is on the menu, it’s not always ethical — or legal — to eat it.

“It cures cancer,” she said.

The contraband was a scale from a pangolin, an armored anteater that looks a cross between an artichoke and a Pokémon.

A skittish creature that snuffles about for ants at night and rolls into a ball whenever threatened, the pangolin is now the world’s most-trafficked mammal, driven to the brink of extinction by poaching for a Chinese market that uses their scales for medicine and considers their meat a delicacy.

Hunting pangolin has been illegal in China for more than a decade, but smuggling of the animals is a growing industry, especially in the southern provinces bordering Vietnam and Thailand.

In Guangxi province, a Beijing-based environmental nonprofit has sued the government agency responsible for wildlife protection for letting hundreds of rescued pangolins die in its care.

Government records show that the agency placed hundreds of the animals in “foster care” with companies that have nothing to do with wildlife conservation. One was a steel manufacturer under police investigation for wildlife trafficking.

“There have been thousands that have disappeared,” said Zhou Jinfeng, head of the non-profit China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, which has been pressing the government to account for all the pangolins it’s taken in.

Guangxi’s forestry department says that pangolins are hard to keep alive and may have died because of mistreatment by smugglers before being rescued.

The animals are prized for their scales, which are pried off the bodies of pangolins that have been killed. A single animal can have 1,000 scales.

More than 50 tons of scales — which would require slaughtering more than 100,000 pangolins — have been seized globally in the last four months, according to San Francisco-based animal protection group WildAid.

Most of the demand comes from China, where pangolins are still legally approved for use in more than 60 medicines despite a 2007 ban on hunting the animals and a 2018 ban on importing them.

There are eight species of pangolin. Under the United Nations treaty on endangered species, six of the eight species are classified as “vulnerable” and two are “critically endangered.” All eight are banned from international trade.

Chinese pangolin populations have fallen by more than 94% since the 1960s, according to WildAid.

Chinese law considers the pangolin a Category II endangered species, meaning its protection is relegated to the provincial level and — unlike Category I animals such as the giant panda — it can still be farmed and sold with permits for limited use.

Critics say enforcement of that permit system is rife with corruption, allowing trafficking to continue.

In Nanning’s traditional Chinese medicine market, three different sellers warned that officials were cracking down on pangolin sales, but then brought out their products and promised they could source more for big buyers.

One of the shops sold individual scales for roughly $14 each. They are used for gua sha, a medicinal body-scraping that is meant to improve energy circulation, a core concept of traditional Chinese medicine. Polished, engraved scales that are collected as art could go for $140 apiece, the seller said.

Two other shopkeepers showed a Times reporter bags of dried pangolin scales available for roughly $336 a pound. Those scales could be ground up and consumed with water to improve blood circulation and lactation, they said.

Pangolin scales mostly consist of keratin, the same stuff that makes up fingernails. Their medical efficacy has not been proven, but the Chinese species (one of eight) is listed in the Chinese pharmacopeia, a catalog of official medicines and their standard uses.

Chinese medicine now relies on smuggled African and Southeast Asian pangolin.

Zhou said medicine based on non-Chinese pangolin is “fake,” driven by commercialization of Chinese tradition for a burgeoning middle class of unquestioning Chinese consumers.

“We don’t even need this much medicine,” he said. “It’s not real demand. It’s not actual human demand. It’s the madness of capitalism and corporations, pushing human action to also go mad. If we don’t change, the whole world’s pangolins will go extinct.”

Feng Yibin, the associate director of Hong Kong University’s School of Chinese Medicine, said demand for traditional Chinese medicine is hard to change, even when there are more sustainable alternatives.

“It’s thousands of years of culture and history,” he said.

Feng, for example, has failed to persuade many people that plant-based alternatives to bear bile, a traditional Chinese medicine ingredient, are more effective than the real stuff — despite publishing scientific papers showing it.

“You have this scientific data, but they don’t want to listen to it,” he said. “It’s a matter of belief.”

China has tried to strengthen wildlife protection, especially after consumption of civet cats was linked to the outbreak of SARS in Guangdong province in 2003.

In posters around the city of Guangzhou, celebrities including the Hong Kong martial artist and actor Jackie Chan and the Taiwanese singer Jay Chou pose with pangolins and warn that buying or eating endangered animal products is illegal.

But official corruption and lack of enforcement belie the messaging campaign.

As recently as 2015, government officials in Guangxi were posting social media photos of themselves feasting on pangolin meat at banquets.

A former wildlife rescue official in Guangxi’s forestry department told The Times that Chinese smugglers had called his office almost daily offering bribes for turning a blind eye to their black markets.

“There’s too much temptation for bribery in this position,""he said. “Today they offer you one hundred thousand, you say no. Tomorrow they offer you two hundred thousand, you say no. The next day, they offer you more money. What will you say?”

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had always refused bribes but never arrested the smugglers because he was afraid of retaliation by powerful crime syndicates.

“For five years, the more I did it, the more scared I felt,” he said. “The three biggest trafficked items in the world are drugs, arms, and wildlife. This is terrifying. They’re the biggest criminal circles of illegal smuggling.”

Two other wildlife officials were later convicted of bribery, he said. He called the most recent case involving Guangxi forestry department “ridiculous.”

“What does a steel company do with pangolins?” he said.

The company in question, Yanbu Yuehuiteng Steel of Foshan, Guangdong province, sells metal hardware and electrical appliances.

It was implicated in an investigation by Hunan police involving 129 suspected wildlife traffickers and more than 50,000 smuggled pangolins, according to local media.

The pangolin is obscure but also a “flagship type of animal,” Zhou said. Saving the pangolin would set a precedent for wildlife protection in China, he said.

“We shouldn’t destroy our own natural habitat because of humans’ never-ending business growth,” Zhou said. “It’s going to come back to us.”",It’s a mammal. It looks like an artichoke.

0,"A newly identified species of pterosaur is among the largest ever flying animals, according to a study from Queen Mary University of London.

Cryodrakon boreas, from the Azhdarchid group of pterosaurs (often incorrectly called ‘pterodactyls’), was a flying reptile with a wingspan of up to 10 meters which lived during the Cretaceous period around 77 million years ago.

Its remains were discovered 30 years ago in Alberta, Canada, but paleontologists had assumed they belonged to an already known species of pterosaur discovered in Texas, USA, named Quetzalcoatlus.

The study, published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, reveals it is actually a new species and the first pterosaur to be discovered in Canada.

Dr David Hone, lead author of the study from Queen Mary University of London, said: “This is a cool discovery, we knew this animal was here but now we can show it is different to other azhdarchids and so it gets a name.”

A young animal

Although the remains – consisting of a skeleton that has part of the wings, legs, neck and a rib – were originally assigned to Quetzalcoatlus, study of this and additional material uncovered over the years shows it is a different species in light of the growing understanding of azhdarchid diversity.

The main skeleton is from a young animal with a wingspan of about 5 meters but one giant neck bone from another specimen suggests an adult animal would have a wingspan of around 10 meters.

This makes Cryodrakon boreas comparable in size to other giant azhdarchids including the Texan Quetzalcoatlus which could reach 10.5 m in wingspan and weighed around 250 kg. Like other azhdarchids these animals were carnivorous and predominantly predated on small animals which would likely include lizards, mammals, and even baby dinosaurs.

A better picture

Dr Hone added: “It is great that we can identify Cryodrakon as being distinct to Quetzalcoatlus as it means we have a better picture of the diversity and evolution of predatory pterosaurs in North America.”

Unlike most pterosaur groups, azhdarchids are known primarily from terrestrial settings and, despite their likely capacity to cross oceanic distances in flight, they are broadly considered to be animals that were adapted for, and lived in, inland environments.

Despite their large size and a distribution across North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Europe, few azhdarchids are known from more than fragmentary remains. This makes Cryodrakon an important animal since it has very well preserved bones and includes multiple individuals of different sizes.

Numaligarh: A Chinese pangolin was recovered from a brick industry near Numaligarh on Tuesday. When the pangolin was sighted in a brick industry near the Kamargaon area, a lot of people gathered there to see the endangered species. After being informed, a joint team of police under Kamargaon Police Outpost and forest personnel under Numaligarh Forest Beat office reached the spot and rescued the pangolin.

Later, it was sent to the CWRC (Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation) facility, Borjuri near Bokakhat. According to Jayanta Goswami, Beat-Officer of Numaligarh Forest Beat, the weight of the pangolin was around 8 kg.

Locals of the area said that the Chinese Pangolin might have been living in that place since a while. It is believed that it came from Kaziranga National Park during the recent flood and took shelter in the brick industry.

0,"The critically endangered Chinese giant salamander is not just one, but three distinct species, researchers have now confirmed in a new study.

One of the newly recognized species, the South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi), could be largest amphibian on the planet, the researchers say.

The researchers say they hope the recognition of the Chinese giant salamanders as three species will help the amphibians’ conservation by triggering separate management plans for the species.

The Chinese giant salamander, which reaches lengths of more than 5 feet (1.6 meters), enjoys the title of being the world’s largest living species of amphibian. However, the critically endangered salamander is not just one, but three distinct species, researchers have now confirmed in a new study.

One of the newly recognized species, the South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi), could be largest amphibian on the planet, the researchers say.

“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” Melissa Marr, a doctoral researcher at the Natural History Museum, London, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. “Our results indicate that tailored conservation measures should be put in place that preserve the genetic integrity of each distinct species.”

The Chinese giant salamander was once widespread across central, eastern and southern China. But habitat loss, poaching, and illegal collection for farming as luxury food items wiped out most animals, making them incredibly rare in the wild today. Millions of these salamanders live on farms, though.

In a study published last year, Samuel Turvey, a conservation scientist at the Zoological Society of London, and colleagues who spent four years surveying the salamander’s preferred river habitats across 97 counties in China reported finding only 24 wild individuals at four sites. But even those were likely farmed animals, the researchers said, ones that had either escaped or had been released as part of government-sponsored conservation initiatives.

For a long time, all Chinese giant salamanders were considered to be a single species, Andrias davidianus. Some researchers did suspect that the salamander likely comprised more than just the one species, and another study by Turvey and team published last year found just that: analysis of tissue samples from 70 wild-caught and 1,034 farm-bred salamanders showed that the Chinese giant salamander once included least five genetically distinct lineages. Today’s salamanders, however, show extensive hybridization as a consequence of mixing of the species through farming, the researchers said.

These genetic studies, however, relied on samples collected in recent decades, when the salamanders had already been moved extensively for farming, making conclusions about distinct species difficult. In the latest study, Turvey and his colleagues analyzed samples from a series of historical museum specimens of the salamanders to see what the wild local populations of the Chinese giant salamander may have been like before the onset of widespread farming and movement of the animals by humans.

In the end, the team identified three distinct genetic lineages, sufficiently different enough to represent separate species, each associated with a different river drainage system. These include A. davidianus, A. sligoi, and a third, yet-to-be-named species. The different species of Chinese giant salamanders began to diverge 3.1 million years ago, Turvey said, corresponding to a period of mountain formation in China, as the Tibetan Plateau rose rapidly.

Of the three recognized species, the South China giant salamander (A. sligoi) is most likely the largest, reaching 2 meters (6 feet) in length, the researchers say. The third species, which is known only from tissue samples and not any complete specimen, hasn’t yet been formally described.

The researchers say they hope that the recognition of the Chinese giant salamanders as three species will help the amphibians’ conservation by triggering separate management plans for the species. The team also urges that efforts be made to identify and protect sites where wild populations of the three different Chinese giant salamander species may still occur.

“Salamanders are currently moved widely around China, for conservation translocation and to stock farms that cater for China’s luxury food market,” Turvey said. “Conservation plans must now be updated to recognise the existence of multiple giant salamander species, and movement of these animals should be prohibited to reduce the risk of disease transfer, competition, and genetic hybridisation.”

Researchers have identified two new species of giant salamander - one of which they suspect is the world’s biggest amphibian - using DNA from museum specimens collected in the early 20th century.

Chinese giant salamanders, now classified as critically endangered, were once widespread throughout central, southern and eastern China, researchers noted.

They have previously been considered a single species (Andrias davidianus). However, the new analysis by researchers from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and London’s Natural History Museum of 17 historical museum specimens and tissue samples from wild salamanders challenges this assumption.

The research, published in the journal Ecology and Evolution, found three distinct genetic lineages in salamanders from different river systems and mountain ranges across China. These lineages are sufficiently genetically different that they represent separate species: Andrias davidianus, Andrias sligoi, and a third species which has yet to be named, researchers said.

One of the newly identified species, the South China giant salamander (Andrias sligoi), was first proposed in the 1920s based on an unusual salamander from southern China that lived at the time at London Zoo, they said. The idea was then abandoned but has been confirmed by this study, according to researchers.

he team used the same animal, now preserved as a specimen in the Natural History Museum after living for 20 years at the Zoo, to define the characteristics of the new species. The other unnamed new species, from Huangshan (the Yellow Mountains), is still only known from tissue samples and has yet to be formally described.

“Our analysis reveals that Chinese giant salamander species diverged between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago,” said Professor Samuel Turvey of ZSL’s Institute of Zoology. These dates correspond to a period of mountain formation in China as the Tibetan Plateau rose rapidly, which could have isolated giant salamander populations and led to the evolution of distinct species in different landscapes.

The decline in wild Chinese giant salamander numbers has been catastrophic, mainly due to recent overexploitation for food, researchers said.

“We hope that this new understanding of their species diversity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain,” Turvey said.

Salamanders are currently moved widely around China, for conservation translocation and to stock farms that cater for China’s luxury food market. “Conservation plans must now be updated to recognise the existence of multiple giant salamander species, and movement of these animals should be prohibited to reduce the risk of disease transfer, competition, and genetic hybridisation,” said Turvey.

Chinese giant salamanders are the world’s biggest amphibians, researchers noted. They suggest that the newly discovered South China giant salamander - which can reach nearly two metres - is the largest of the three and is therefore the largest of the 8,000 or so amphibian species alive today.","New giant salamander species identified, may be world’s largest amphibian",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vaXQtcy12aXJhbC9uZXctZ2lhbnQtc2FsYW1hbmRlci1zcGVjaWVzLWlkZW50aWZpZWQtbWF5LWJlLXdvcmxkLXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1hbXBoaWJpYW4vc3RvcnktUTRCSE5yWHN3bklLc2w3V2pFT0V1SS5odG1s0gGWAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5oaW5kdXN0YW50aW1lcy5jb20vaXQtcy12aXJhbC9uZXctZ2lhbnQtc2FsYW1hbmRlci1zcGVjaWVzLWlkZW50aWZpZWQtbWF5LWJlLXdvcmxkLXMtbGFyZ2VzdC1hbXBoaWJpYW4vc3RvcnktUTRCSE5yWHN3bklLc2w3V2pFT0V1SV9hbXAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2019/09/18/Pictures/_a8b43418-da0e-11e9-89b8-e15e15df329c.jpg,2019-09-18,"{'sent': 'Researchers have identified two new species of giant salamander - one of which they suspect is the world’s biggest amphibian - using DNA from museum specimens collected in the early 20th century.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"China’s pangolin population has dropped over 90 percent from the 1960s to 2004 due to massive poaching for its meat as a delicacy and its scales for medicinal use.

By Jiaming Xu

Outside the gates of a warehouse in southern China, a middle-aged man surnamed Zhang at first showed no interest in talking to us or answering questions about his business dealings in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM).

His mood changed when we mentioned pangolins. “Do you have supply?” he said. “Come to our office, let’s talk about it more.”

Zhang works in the supply department of a TCM producer in Shantou, Guangdong Province. “So far this year, we’ve used several tons of pangolin scales,” Zhang said. “We need at least a few hundred kilograms a month.”

“We ordered a ton of scales last month, but it hasn’t arrived yet,” he said, adding that they would also sell unprocessed scales to other pharmaceutical companies.

Our reporters reviewed more than 400 court decisions in criminal cases in China related to the illegal trade in pangolins from 2005 to 2019. In only a few of the court cases we studied were prosecutors able or willing to retrace the smuggling routes to their origins, like Indonesia and Nigeria.

The numbers of pangolin seizures are rising, not only in China, the primary market, but also in transit hubs such as Vietnam, Singapore and Hong Kong, according to EIA figures.

Even in those places, the origin of the goods remains unknown for the vast majority of cases.

Breeding and keeping pangolins has proved difficult. China has an intransparent system that allows for the continued consumption of pangolin stockpiles for TCM. Due to the high demand and limited regulatory oversight, many suppliers rely on cheaper, illegal imports.

Photo Credit: Reuters / TPG Images Slaughtered pangolins are seen on the ground after they were seized by the authority, at an underground garage in Guangzhou, China, September 11, 2014.

This was why we visited Zhang, undercover, at his factory in southern China. We wanted to know where his scales came from.

Zhang insisted that his company was willing to pay a surcharge to source only legal scales, even though they could cost up to twice as much. “Price is not a problem,” he said.

His company, among others, makes TCM concoctions out of raw pangolin scales in industrial quantities. We later reached out to the company, asking them about the origin of their scales. They declined to comment.

But his statements left us curious. If a medium-sized company like his needs tons of scales, where would larger pharmaceutical companies source their pangolin scales?

Where do these millions of pangolins come from if there are almost none left in China?

China’s pangolin population has dropped over 90 percent from the 1960s to 2004 due to massive poaching for its meat as a delicacy and its scales for medicinal use. The Chinese pangolin has been “commercially extinct” since 1995, researchers say.

The profit margins we found are astounding. Scales bought for as little as US$5 per kilogram in Nigeria can be resold for up to US$1,000 in China, according to traders we interviewed in China. If mixed with legally acquired scales, their price can be as high as US$1,800 per kilogram.

Who would want pangolin scales? According to some TCM practitioners, pangolin scales can cure a host of ailments, including inflammation and poor lactation in new mothers, and even impotence and cancer.

Dr. Lao Lixing, the former director of the School of Chinese Medicine at The University of Hong Kong, said that there is no scientific research that supports the claim that pangolin scales have healing properties.

He said that TCM practitioners in Hong Kong and mainland China have largely stopped prescribing medications with pangolin scales, but pharmaceutical companies have continued to produce drugs with the scales. “It’s a matter of market and profits,"" he said. ""To further the ban on pangolin use in Chinese medicine, we need more public education and concerted efforts by the TCM sector.”

“TCM professionals need to speak up to defend the good name of the Chinese medicine,” said Dr. Lao, who speaks regularly at international conferences to advocate replacing animal ingredients in TCM with plant-based substitutes.

Although its medicinal properties are unproven, mostly Chinese patients appear to be consuming literally tons of these products. The problem is that we don’t know how much.

“There continues to be a complete lack of transparency on the quantities of pangolin scale stockpiles held by the government or private entities in China,” Chris Hamley, a senior campaigner on pangolins at EIA, wrote in an e-mail. “There is also no information on the estimated quantity of pangolin scales consumed by the Chinese population over a specific time period.”

“The recent string of multi-tonne ‘mega’ shipments of pangolin scales detected by law enforcement agencies in Asia demonstrates that the supply of pangolin scales from historical stockpiles does not meet demand.”

Australian Bear Charity Saves Its First Pangolin in Laos

Perth-based Free The Bears has saved its first pangolin, a critically endangered mammal that is the most trafficked animal in the illegal wildlife trade.

A Perth-based bear rescue charity has saved its first critically endangered pangolin as it seeks to safeguard a variety of animals in Asia, where its Laos sanctuary is expanding.

Free The Bears was founded in 1993 by 81-year-old Mary Hutton after she saw footage of caged moon bears, unable to move, with dirty catheters inserted into their gall bladder to “milk” their bile for traditional medicine.

The organisation has so far rescued more than 950 bears and is now helping other illegally-kept animals it encounters.

Last year, Free The Bears made the world’s biggest seizure of red pandas, believed to be bound for the black market pet trade, but only half survived as they had been kept in dire conditions.

The charity last week took in its first pangolin, a “super rare” species from China, where their keratin scales are prized in the traditional Chinese medicine and folk remedies for curing a range of ailments, chief executive Matt Hunt said.

Pangolins are the most trafficked animals in the illegal wildlife trade, with African species shipped to Asia thousands at a time.

Hunt said the slow moving and breeding mammal’s only defence was to curl up in a ball and they were “possibly competing with the panda” for risk of extinction.

Pangolins are sold by the kilogram, with smugglers often force feeding them sand or rice gruel mixed with the ants they favour, which makes them sick.

“They’re totally ill-equipped to survive against a trade demand like this,” Hunt told AAP.

“They’re just defenceless.”

Free The Bears was moments away from completing construction of its first pangolin sanctuary when the almost lifeless male arrived and was immediately treated by an Australian Volunteers International vet.

All going well, he’ll be released into the wild in northern Laos next month.

Hunt said the charity, which also has sanctuaries in Vietnam and Cambodia, had drawn the line at saving tigers and elephants given their resource-intensive needs.

“Mary would help the world if she could—she’s not a bear snob at all,” he said.

“But we have to be realistic about the fact we’re a small organisation being run out of a garage in Perth.”

Hunt will meet a nutritionist at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo this week to talk about possible alternative diets for pangolins as gathering enough ants can be tricky.

0,"As the largest amphibian in the world, the Chinese Giant Salamander (Andrias davidianus) can grow up to 1.8 metres in length and 110 pounds in weight. The salamander lives in the tributaries of the Pearl, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers in China, but has been found as far out as Taiwan and Japan. They produce an acrid and milky skin secretion that repels predators. It has a carnivorous diet including crabs, millipedes, and fish, but is also very prone to cannibalism. New analysis of specimens has led to suggestions that the Chinese Giant Salamander is actually three different species rather than one. They have been classified as critically endangered in the wild

However, all is not well at the moment for the Chinese Giant Salamander, as they have been classified as critically endangered in the wild, on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Deforestation, water pollution, dam construction, and mining activity has made many previous habitats of the salamander uninhabitable. Millions of these salamanders are kept in farms to be killed for meat or to be used in traditional medicines and are often poached from the wild – yet wild populations are rapidly declining and are on the way to being wiped out. In a field study of 97 sites in 16 provinces in China, only 24 Giant Salamanders were found in just 4 of the sites. Genetic analysis indicated that these specimens may have been released from farms. Conservation efforts such as protecting habitats and enforcing anti-poaching laws will be essential to ensure the preservation of this gargantuan amphibian.",Creature Feature: Chinese Giant Salamander,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlZGJyaWNrLm1lL2NoaW5lc2UtZ2lhbnQtc2FsYW1hbmRlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i2.wp.com/www.redbrick.me/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/1024px-Velemlok_čínský_zoo_praha_1.jpg?fit=1023%2C683&ssl=1,2019-10-17,"{'sent': 'As the largest amphibian in the world, the Chinese Giant Salamander (Andrias davidianus) can grow up to 1.8 metres in length and 110 pounds in weight.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['110 pounds', 'up to 1.8 metres']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

Tamulpur: Some villagers from Binowapur Tinali under Kumarikata forest range office in Baksa district along Indo-Bhutan border rescued an endangered species of Chinese pangolin on Saturday night.

The villagers saw it along the bank of a pond and caught it with a fishing net. On Sunday morning, the villagers informed the forest officials of the Kumarikata forest range office about the pangolin. A large number of villagers thronged to have a glimpse of the pangolin. A team from the Kumarikata forest range office reached Binowapur village at around 8.30 am and took the Chinese pangolin into their custody. The forest team later safely released the rescued pangolin in the Dihira Reserve Forest in presence of forest officials and locals.

0,"Scientists have identified a new bird species from the Southern coast of China, that diverged from its Northern relatives around half a million years ago.

New research by the Milner Centre for Evolution academics in collaboration with Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou (China) shows that Southern and Northern breeding populations of plovers in China are in fact two distinct species: Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) in the North and white-faced plover (Charadrius dealbatus) in the South. Using state-of-the-art genomics analysis, the team revealed that the Kentish plover and White-faced plover diverged approximately half a million years ago due to cycling sea level changes between the Eastern and Southern China Sea causing intermittent isolation of the two regional populations.

The results show that despite looking very similar, the two plover species have high levels of genetic divergence on their sex chromosomes, (Z chromosome) than on other chromosomes, indicating that sexual selection might play a role to in the evolution of the two species.

Dr. Yang Liu, a visiting scholar from Sun Yat-sen University at the Milner Centre for Evolution, led the work. He said: “The initial divergence of the two plovers was probably triggered by the geographical isolation.

“However, other factors, such as ecological specializations, behavioral divergence, and sexual selection could also contribute to the speciation of the two species.

“In future studies, we wish to understand how these factors operate on plover populations.”

Dr. Araxi Urrutia, Senior Lecturer from the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath, said: “Speciation – the process by which new species evolve – is the basis of all biodiversity around us, yet our understanding of how new species arise is still limited.

“By studying recent divergence patterns, where the two species still able to reproduce with each other, we can better understand the conditions on which all species, including our own species, have evolved.”

The team has published their findings in two papers. The first paper revealed small to moderate differences between Kentish and white-faced plover in their appearance (morphology), diet and behavior. The second study produced the first genome of the Kentish plover, one of the few published genomes from shorebirds.

Dr. Liu said: “The genomic resources generated by our team will help investigate other important evolutionary questions, such as genetic basis of local adaptation, migration and mating system variation.”

Led by Dr. Liu, the research team also included Dr. Araxi Urrutia, Professor Tamás Székely and a former NERC funded Ph.D. student Dr. Kathryn Maher.

The research is part of a long-term study on the Kentish plover that has been running for over 30 years, led by Professor Székely.

He said: “Plovers are excellent model systems to understand breeding system evolution.

“These small, drab shorebirds have worldwide distribution, and they are amenable to field studies.

“Using plovers as model organisms, we are currently testing for key hypotheses of several fundamental questions in biology using behavioral, genomic, immunological, and demographic approaches.”

0,"The two young women who arrived at Heathrow in February 2014 en route to Düsseldorf were carrying nondescript luggage. Customs officers were suspicious nevertheless and looked inside – to find 13 iguanas stuffed into socks inside the cases. Astonishingly, 12 of the highly endangered San Salvador rock iguanas had survived their transatlantic journey.

“There only about 600 of these animals left in the wild, in the Bahamas, and these animals were being taken to a private collector somewhere in Germany. Incredibly, we were able to return 12 of them, alive, to their homeland – on San Salvador island,” said Grant Miller, who was then working for the Border Force’s endangered species team.

The incident remains one of the strangest attempts at wildlife trafficking in recent years and reveals the extent to which individuals will try to break the law to obtain endangered animals for their collections, or to buy body parts to consume for their alleged medical properties, or as exotic food. Illegal wildlife trade is now the fourth most profitable form of trafficking in the world, after drugs, guns and humans.

And it is a trade that is increasing dramatically, ranging from the smuggling of the occasional, individual rare creature – like the endangered Chinese giant salamander that was recently found inside a cereal box brought into the UK – to the trafficking, for their meat and scales, of more than half a million pangolins from Africa to Asia over the past three years. In this latter case, two of the world’s eight species of pangolin are now rated as being critically endangered and there are serious concerns about numbers of the others.

In addition to pangolins, other endangered trafficked animals include elephants, rhinos, European eels and seahorses. Finding ways to halt the widespread loss of these creatures is now becoming a desperate problem, say conservationists, and will be the focus of a meeting, “Can surveillance technology and social science address rule-breaking and wildlife crime?”, to be held this week at the Zoological Society of London.

The conference organiser, Tom Letessier, said one of the most worrying forms of illegal wildlife trade was the killing, on a vast scale, of sharks – in particular grey reef sharks and thresher sharks in the Indian Ocean. “Their fins are cut off and the sharks are dumped back into the sea to drown. Their fins then end up as food for banquets for the rich in south-east Asia,” he added.

As a result, thresher sharks are now considered to be vulnerable to extinction, while grey reef sharks are rated as being “near threatened”. But what can be done?

One idea is to use technological fixes – such as drones which could be flown over ships to film crewmen in the act of dismembering sharks, said Letessier. “The development of increasingly accurate devices, such as synthetic aperture radar for satellites, would also allow authorities to monitor illegal fishing from space in real time,” he added.

“However, it is equally clear that we have to consider social factors when working out why people turn to illegal wildlife trade. Stocks of fish on which local villages depend could become depleted and fishermen have to turn to something else. Sometimes the only thing on offer is a creature that is legally protected.”

This point was backed by Fran Cabada, a marine biologist at ZSL. “Fisherfolk across the world have a very close relationship with the sea,” she said. “If you try to find them a different job, say in a factory, they will not want to take it. They prefer jobs that allow them to be at sea, even if the work there is illegal. So again, we have to include social and economic factors when understanding and tackling illegal wildlife trade, both at sea and on land.”

In addition, the illegal wildlife trade is often linked with organised crime so it may simply be that local people feel compelled to join in, added Cabada.

Miller, who now works for ZSL, agreed. “The organised criminal is always looking for the next opportunity to hammer a particular species. We will see that in the next few months in the UK with the beginning of the fishing season for the European eel. Organised criminals will try to source elvers and ship them out of Europe to markets where they can be made into finished products and then sold round the world – not as endangered European eels but as Japanese eel or American eel. However, gene-testing techniques have recently been developed that allow us to tell very quickly if eel is arriving in a port but is not what it is claimed to be. It is all part of an ongoing battle.”","Tigers, elephants and pangolins suffer as global wildlife trafficking soars",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEEE_Zqz6qqllir571oJxQb0qFggEKg4IACoGCAowl6p7MN-zCTC9vhU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10516f317edcd5daad1d164771789219aa67b798/0_214_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=018b94e171d9eeee30a3644d67654db4,2019-12-08,"{'sent': 'The two young women who arrived at Heathrow in February 2014 en route to Düsseldorf were carrying nondescript luggage.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['two']}}",Pangolin
0,"The first thing to know about the African grey parrot is that it is not entirely grey. The medium-sized bird, which lives in forests in west and central Africa, has electric-red tail feathers that make it a target for poachers, who use the plumage for ceremonial headdresses. Its body parts are used in traditional medicine.

Unfortunately for the African grey, these are the least of the species’ problems. A highly intelligent animal capable of mimicking human speech and which can live in captivity up to the age of 60, it has also been a sought-after pet since biblical times.

In an era when the international pet trade has reached industrial proportions, the demand — from the Middle East and Asia as well as Europe and North America — threatens the African grey’s long-term existence in the wild.

The parrot inhabits a strip of equatorial forest that runs from Ivory Coast through Nigeria, Cameroon and Gabon and into the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Ghana, where poaching has been intense, the population has fallen more than 90 per cent since the early 1990s, according to estimates. Numbers of birds in other countries are difficult to gauge, but experts at the Zoological Society of London, the FT’s Seasonal Appeal partner for 2019, say they are falling sharply.

So acute has the problem become that the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) outlawed trade of the African grey altogether in 2016. Before the ban, about 1.3m parrots had been exported legally since 1980, according to estimates, excluding the hundreds of thousands that likely died during trapping and transportation.

Conservationists are divided over the efficacy of the ban. Samuel Nebaneh, a law enforcement co-ordinator in Cameroon, which has a large population of grey parrots, welcomes it. “It has had a positive effect. Some parrots have been seized and traffickers have been sent to trial,” he said.

Others say the ban has driven up prices, and therefore the incentive to poach, as well as prompting trappers to use longer smuggling routes where the birds are more likely to die en route. An African grey can retail for £1,000.

Pamela Watson, an author who kept two African greys when she lived in the Nigerian city of Lagos, said the Cites ban was inadequate without work at village level to give people alternative incomes.

“They’re not able to stop it because the traffickers are armed. This is a huge business. There are international gangs behind this,” said Ms Watson, who now lives in London and has been unable to obtain an export licence for her parrots, which remain with friends in Lagos. After having the parrots for years and realising how intelligent they were, she said, she would not now advocate keeping them in captivity.

In 2014, Mr Nebaneh encountered a Ghanaian poacher in south-west Cameroon who had been exporting trapped birds in batches of 500.

In Cameroon, parrots are caught in forest clearings where they congregate in huge numbers. Trappers take advantage of their sociability, smearing glue on to palm fronds and branches and tethering decoy birds, which call out and attract victims to the area. The parrots become stuck and many perish through lack of food and water before trappers come to collect them. Sometimes hunters cast nets over whole flocks.

ZSL is working with authorities in Cameroon to try to halt smuggling, intervening at all levels of the supply chain. It sets up camera traps to monitor wild populations, works with local communities to discourage poaching and provide alternative livelihoods, and helps train eco-guards and border officials to recognise and stop the trade.

When birds are seized, as well as helping authorities prepare for trial through expert witnesses and record keeping, ZSL teaches eco-guards how to care for the birds and return them to the wild.

Hauls of 100 or more are not uncommon, but all too often the parrots, malnourished and traumatised, die before they can be rehabilitated.

ZSL has helped destroy parrot traps within the Dja reserve, a Unesco world heritage site © ZSL ZSL's Gary Ward, front row left, with eco-guards he has helped train to prevent poaching and to look after the seized parrots © ZSL

Gary Ward, curator of birds at London Zoo, visited Cameroon’s Dja reserve in November to help eco-guards care for seized parrots, including providing appropriate aviaries and food supplements. “The husbandry training is pretty basic,” he said. “We’re not trying to train them how to breed the parrots, just to keep them alive.”

Eleanor Harvie, ZSL’s programme manager for Africa, said the eco-guards were easy to motivate, as it was more rewarding to seize live birds than, say, the tusks of an elephant or the scales of a pangolin that had already been killed. While understanding of the parrots’ numbers in the wild remained sketchy, she said, there might be enough to make preservation a realistic goal.

Grant Miller, who until recently worked for the UK Border Force and is now a counter-trafficking adviser to ZSL, has direct experience of the exotic pet trade. “They’re like stamp collectors,” he said of those who order rare species. “I want what I haven’t got.”

Mr Miller remembers rushing to Heathrow airport in June 2018 after receiving a tip-off from Interpol that a man named Jeffrey Lendrum was arriving on a flight from Johannesburg. “He was the Pablo Escobar of the bird world,” said Mr Miller of a man who had been arrested numerous times on bird smuggling charges.

On this occasion, Mr Lendrum was nabbed with 19 eggs and two newly hatched chicks secreted in a heavy jacket. The fish eagle and kestrel eggs, whose trade was banned, were worth between £2,000 and £8,000 each.

Grey parrots are not yet as rare or as endangered. ZSL, said Mr Miller, was hoping to keep it that way.

0,"Customs officers check the smuggled pangolin scales in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province. [Photo provided to China Daily]

The anti-smuggling bureau of Hangzhou Customs and the public security department in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, jointly seized over 23 metric tons of smuggled pangolin scales and detained 18 suspects in late October after one year of investigation and anti-smuggling efforts, Hangzhou Customs announced on Wednesday.

Given that only 400 to 600 grams of scales can be extracted from each pangolin, a nationally protected species, the plate-like scales seized in Wenzhou and smuggled from Busan, South Korea, in batches since November last year were estimated to be extracted from around 50,000 pangolins.

It is believed to be the largest haul of smuggled wildlife products in recent years, China Central Television reported.

In September, customs authorities in Wenzhou found that two people from the city were selling pangolin scales, which are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, in a black market in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region.

At the end of October, customs received a tip that a batch of scales would be smuggled into China and those two people would be involved.

""A man surnamed Cai purchased pangolin scales in Nigeria and entrusted an overseas smuggling group to transport them to Busan first. Then, the man's two partners in Wenzhou hired another group to deliver them to Wenzhou via Shanghai,"" said Feng Chenxue, a Hangzhou Customs official.

The containers with scales, mixed with slices of ginger, were unloaded at a wharf in Shanghai and then transferred to Wenzhou where local customs authorities seized the containers and caught the suspects, according to Feng.

""The smuggled pangolin scales were wrapped with layers of ginger slices in bags, which makes them hard to detect during routine spot checks,"" said Chen Ling, a policeman from Wenzhou Public Security Bureau.

The cost of pangolin scales overseas is about 80 to 150 yuan ($11.40 to $21.30) per kilogram, while the selling price in China could reach 800 yuan as the scales are believed to be beneficial for health, Feng said.

Hangzhou Customs said they will continue working with local public security authorities to crack down on the smuggling of wildlife and endangered species into and out of China.

This is a story of incredible patience. Botanists first encountered individuals of this tree in 1982 while surveying the Madeira River Basin in the Brazilian Amazon. They knew it was a species of Coccoloba, a genus of flowering plants that grows in the tropical forests of the Americas, but they couldn’t pinpoint the species. The individual trees they came across weren’t bearing any flowers or fruits then, parts that are essential to describing a plant species, and the trees’ leaves were too large to dehydrate, press and carry back with them.

While the plant, and its massive leaves, became locally famous, it was only in 2005, that the researchers finally collected some seeds and dying flowers from a tree. These materials weren’t good enough to describe the plant species, but the researchers sowed the seeds at the campus of the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA), grew the seedlings, and waited. Thirteen years later, in 2018, one of the planted trees flourished and fruited, finally giving the researchers the botanical material they needed to describe the new species. The new species, named C. gigantifolia in reference to the plant’s giant leaves, grows to about 15 meters (49 feet) in height and has leaves that can reach 2.5 meters (8 feet) in length, likely the largest known leaf among dicotyledonous plants — a large group of flowering plants that include sunflowers, hibiscus, tomatoes and roses.

It’s not everyday that you find a previously undescribed species in a fish market, but that’s exactly what Jeff Johnson, an ichthyologist with Australia’s Queensland Museum, did. He had first heard of a mystery grouper 15 years back, and since then, received occasional photographs of the fish, which he thought was a potential new-to-science species. In 2017, when a fisherman sent Johnson a picture of the grouper yet again, Johnson tracked down the market where the fisherman had sold the fish, and bought all five individuals of the fish he found there. Then, together with his colleagues, Johnson analyzed the fish’s DNA, and compared it to those of related species in the museum. Finally, in a new paper published this year, the researchers confirmed that the grouper is indeed new to science, and they named it Epinephelus fuscomarginatus.

This year, herpetologists introduced us to three previously undescribed species of extremely small frogs from Madagascar, aptly named Mini mum, Mini ature, and Mini scule. All of them, just a few millimeters long, belong to Mini, a genus that is also entirely new to science. The new frog species are known from just a handful of locations, and may already be threatened with extinction. Researchers have recorded Mini mum only in Manombo Special Reserve in southeast Madagascar, for example, while Mini scule is known only from the fragmented forests of Sainte Luce Reserve. The areas in which the frogs occur are also likely small, threatened and declining.

For a long time, the Chinese giant salamander, which reaches lengths of more than 5 feet (1.6 meters) and is the world’s largest known living species of amphibian, was considered to be a single species, Andrias davidianus. In the past, some researchers did suspect that the salamander was probably multiple species, but a new study published this year backed the suspicion with evidence. Researchers analyzed samples of the salamander from a series of historical museum specimens to see what local wild populations of the amphibian may have been like before humans started farming the animals and moving them around extensively, and found that the salamander is not just one, but three distinct species. These include A. davidianus, A. sligoi, and a third species that hadn’t been named at the time the study was published. Of the three recognized species, the South China giant salamander (A. sligoi) is most likely the largest, reaching 2 meters (6 feet) in length, the researchers say.

Scientists Alexandra Nietsch and Carsten Niemitz first spotted this tarsier on the Togean Islands off Sulawesi, Indonesia, in 1993. Locals have known of the primate by the names bunsing, tangkasi and podi. But it took researchers more than 25 years of detailed study, including the tarsier’s vocalization and DNA, to finally describe the small primate as a species that’s new to science in a paper published in 2019. They named the species Niemitz’s tarsier (Tarsius niemitzi) in honor of the scientist who was one of the first to bring it to the attention of the scientific world. The description of Niemitz’s tarsier has increased the number of known tarsier species in Sulawesi and surrounding islands to 12, but the authors say the islands could be home to at least 16.

This year, researchers described nine new species of bees from the island country of Fiji in the southern Pacific Ocean. These colorful bees in shades of black, golden-green, and metallic, with hints of purple iridescence, are part of the genus Homalictus Cockerell, a group that’s not been taxonomically reviewed in Fiji for 40 years. Many of these bees either have very restricted distributions or are known only from single mountaintops, according to the researchers, and could soon become extinct due to changes in climate and other environmental risks. One new-to-science species, Homalictus terminalis, for example, has only been found on Mount Batilamu, where it seems to be restricted to the top 95 meters (312 feet) of the mountain peak. Another newly described species, H. ostridorsum, has only been recorded on Mount Tomanivi, while H. taveuni is named after the island of Taveuni, the only place it is known from.

When researchers surveying the stretch of Amazon forest lying between the Tapajós and Jamanxim rivers in the Brazilian state of Pará, chanced upon a group of three marmosets with white tails, they suspected that it was a potential new-to-science species. White tails are very rare among primates that live in South America; only one other primate species have it. The researchers were right. After studying the monkeys in both the forest and the laboratory, they confirmed that the marmoset, with its distinct white tail, white forearms with a beige-yellowish spot on the elbow, and white feet and hands, was a new species. The marmoset has been named Mico munduruku after the Munduruku, an indigenous group of people who live in the Tapajós–Jamanxim interfluve. It’s not all good news, though. The Amazon forest that’s home to M. munduruku is being rapidly cut for agricultural expansion, logging, hydroelectric power plants, and gold mining.

This year, scientists announced a second, new-to-science species of monkey, also found in the Amazon rainforest. The grey monkeys, named Plecturocebus parecis after the Parecis plateau in Rondônia in Brazil where they are found, were first seen by scientists in 1914. Locally known as the “otôhô,” researchers subsequently saw the monkeys once again in 2011 and confirmed that it was sufficiently distinct from the closely related ashy black titi to be classified as a separate species. The titi monkey’s habitat lies within in the “Arc of Deforestation,” an area of high deforestation where vast swathes of forest have been cleared for cattle ranching and mechanized soy farms. But so far, the monkeys seem to have escaped some of the damage because the steep slopes of the plateau they occupy offer them protection by making the habitat hard to access and unappealing for large-scale deforestation.

Praying mantises tend to resemble leaves or tree trunks and come in shades of green and brown. But in 2013, researchers spotted a bright orange-red mantis with a black abdomen in a research station on the banks of the Amazon River in northern Peru. The praying mantis was not only mimicking a wasp’s bright colors, but also a wasp’s movements. Such conspicuous mimicry of wasps is rare among mantises, making this finding exciting, the researchers wrote in a paper published this year. The new-to-science species was named Vespamantoida wherleyi, the genus name Vespamantoida meaning wasp-mantis.

Giant flying squirrels belonging to the group Biswamoyopterus are incredibly rare. The first species described in the genus, the Namdapha flying squirrel (Biswamoyopterus biswasi) from India, has been seen by researchers only once in 1981. Its Laotian relative, the Laotian giant flying squirrel (Biswamoyopterus laoensis), was first spotted by researchers in bushmeat markets of Lao PDR (Laos) in 2012. Both species are known from a single specimen each. This year, scientists in China introduced us to a third species of the genus, Mount Gaoligong flying squirrel (B. gaoligongensis), which they first spotted in the collection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Thankfully, the team could subsequently observe the animals in the field as well and collect another specimen. Compared to the “lost” Namdapha and Laotian giant flying squirrels, researchers say that Mount Gaoligong flying squirrel’s conservation status looks “slightly optimistic.”

The new-to-science American pocket shark (Mollisquama mississippiensis) is the world’s second pocket shark species to be described. Researchers were surveying the eastern Gulf of Mexico to study what sperm whales eat when they collected a large sample of animals from the ocean’s depths. Among the collection was a small shark that the team hadn’t seen before. As it turned out, the animal was a previously undescribed species of pocket shark (the pocket shark gets its names not for its small size but because of small pocket-like openings or glands found behind each of its pectoral fins). This year, the researchers introduced the American pocket shark to us in a new paper, noting that the species has numerous light-producing organs or photophores covering much of the body, which possibly helps the shark glow in the dark depths of the deep sea.

This tree, which grows up to 20 meters (66 feet) in height and bears white flowers, is extremely rare. So far, the newly described species, belonging to the custard apple family of trees, or Annonaceae, is known only from the Usambara mountains of northeastern Tanzania — a few individuals have been observed in the Amani Nature Reserve in the Eastern Usambara Mountains and one in a private reserve in western Usambara. Both reserves are ‘islands’ within a deforested landscape with an extensive clearance of forest in neighboring areas, the researchers write in a paper published this year. Researchers have named it Mischogyne iddii, after Iddi Rajabu, a resident botanist at the Amani Nature Reserve, and they estimate that fewer than 50 individuals of the tree remain in the wild.

In May 2016, wildlife researcher Rohan Pandit and his teammate Wangchu Phiang, a member of the indigenous Bugun tribe living in the northeastern state of Arunachal Pradesh in India, were surveying Arunachal’s biodiversity when they stumbled upon a snake amid the leaf litter. Pandit knew it was a species of viper, a group of venomous snakes with folding fangs, but it was unlike anything he’d seen before. So he bagged the snake and examined it in detail later, collaborating with other herpetologists to analyze the snake’s morphology and DNA. The team confirmed that the viper was a new-to-science species, and they named it Trimeresurus arunachalensis, or Arunachal pit viper. The new species is closely related to the Tibetan pit viper (Trimeresurus tibetanus), a snake known only from Tibet, but physically and anatomically, the two species are quite distinct, the researchers say.

The leaf-tailed gecko is a master of camouflage. These lizards, belonging to the genus Uroplatus, are found only in the forests of Madagascar and have body shapes and colors that allow them to merge with dried leaves seamlessly. Researchers described a new-to-science species of a leaf-tailed gecko from Marojejy National Park in northeastern Madagascar this year, and it may already be threatened with extinction because of habitat loss and the illegal pet trade. The new species, named Uroplatus finaritra, has a somewhat compressed body, a small triangular head, and a leaf-shaped tail, and it’s a giant member of Uroplatus. Researchers are concerned that the species may already be a victim of the illegal pet trade since it looks similar to the satanic leaf-tailed gecko, a popular pet worldwide.

This year, scientists described a new bird species that are found only on the island of Alor in eastern Indonesia. Named Myzomela prawiradilagae or Alor myzomela, the red-headed honeyeater is known to inhabit only eucalyptus woodland at elevations above 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) on the island, and researchers worry that its habitat on Alor is already undergoing fragmentation because of the growing human population. While locals have long known of this species, researchers hope that its description as a new species will bring in more awareness about its existence, and ensure that the species does not silently become extinct.",Photos: Top 15 new species of 2019,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiENBcVlFyxmr533U-ZxZeMfYqMwgEKioIACIQ65Pnd-s87Ky7YVAI7KgDCSoUCAoiEOuT53frPOysu2FQCOyoAwkwioLEBg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://imgs.mongabay.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2019/05/09072849/T-arunachalensis-snout-768x512.jpg,2019-12-26,"{'sent': 'In 2019, Mongabay covered several announcements of new-to-science species.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Mongabay']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander
0,"The Chinese paddlefish and its close relatives have been around for at least 200 million years. The species, reaching up to 23 feet in length, survived unimaginable changes and upheavals, such as the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs and marine reptiles like plesiosaurs that it swam alongside. In its time, flowering plants evolved, and came to populate the shores of its ancestral home, the Yangtze River, in modern-day China.

Much later, bamboo came on the scene, and well after that, giant pandas. In the last few thousand years, a blink in evolutionary time, the land filled with people, and China became the most populous country on Earth. In the muddy waters of the Yangtze, the paddlefish lived as it had for eons, using its special sword-like snout to sense electrical activity to find prey, such as crustaceans and fish.

But there’s one phenomenon this ancient species, sometimes called the “panda of the Yangtze,” could not survive—humans. A new paper published in the Science of the Total Environment concludes that the species has gone extinct, mainly due to overfishing and dam construction.

It’s “a reprehensible and an irreparable loss,” says study leader Qiwei Wei of the Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, who’s been looking for the animal for decades.

View Images Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius) had a long sword-like rostrum, a snout-like structure packed with cells to detect electrical activity in prey animals such as crustaceans.

“It’s very sad,” adds Zeb Hogan, a fish biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, and a National Geographic Explorer who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s the definitive loss of a very unique and extraordinary animal, with no hope of recovery.”

Hogan says the paddlefish’s extinction should serve as a wake-up call to protect other freshwater species. Large fish, in which he specializes, are especially at risk: Most of the biggest freshwater animals are threatened with extinction, he says.

“This is the first of these very large freshwater fish to go and many are at risk—the concern is that more will go extinct, but the hope is that we can reverse their decline before it’s too late,” Hogan says.

Long goodbye

The species gradually declined over the last century thanks to overfishing; in the 1970s, 25 tons of paddlefish were harvested per year on average.

But what really did it in, the scientists conclude, were dams—specifically the Gezhouba Dam, built on the main stem of the Yangtze, a little over a thousand miles from the sea. This dam, which was constructed without a fish ladder or bypass, cut off the paddlefish from their only spawning grounds upstream, which had only been discovered in the late 1970s.

Populations of the fish continued to dwindle after the 1981 dam construction, but nobody had yet figured out how dire the situation was, says Ivan Jaric, a co-author and biologist at Czechia’s Institute of Hydrobiology and the University of South Bohemia. As is often the case, there can be a significant lag between major disturbances and their impact. The researchers estimate the fish had become functionally extinct by 1993, meaning there were not enough fish to meaningfully reproduce.

Still, sightings continued and several individuals were captured in a series of failed attempts to start a captive-breeding population. In 2002, in Nanjing, a female was captured and urgent efforts were made to save her—but she died a month later.

In 2003, Wei and colleagues attached a tracking tag to a Chinese paddlefish that was accidentally captured near Yibin, in south-central China. They released it to see where it might go, but within hours lost all signals from the tag. That was the last of the species ever seen alive.

The researchers say the best time to have started conservation efforts was before 1993, or certainly before the early 2000s, which is when they began in earnest. The paper estimates the fish went extinct between 2005 and 2010. (What is extinction? The answer is complicated.)

Looking and looking

The study team looked for Chinese paddlefish at hundreds of locations along the Yangtze, as part of an ongoing biological survey of the entire river basin. They used various types of nets, sonar, electro-fishing gear and other techniques to locate any representatives of the species, all to no avail. They also monitored fish markets around the country.

The researchers then used a mathematical model to determine the likelihood that the species is extinct, based on previous population size and the intervals between sightings.

Jaric says there’s a chance that there could still be paddlefish out there, but it’s very unlikely.

'Giant Fish' Faces Big Trouble in China

“Lack of observations during the surveys and during the past 16 years in rivers in highly urbanized regions with considerable level of water use makes new observations improbable,” he says.

The Chinese paddlefish was one of only two paddlefish species in existence; the only remaining relative is the American paddlefish, a vulnerable species found in the Mississippi River Basin in the United States. Both are closely related to the sturgeon family, of which 85 percent are threatened with extinction, making them the most imperiled group of animals, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Large fish are not only crucial players in their ecosystems, they’re sentinels for environmental quality, as the animals can only survive in healthy rivers, Hogan notes.

What next?

Lessons learned from the paddlefish’s loss include the importance of protecting what’s left in the Yangtze, and beyond.

“We must urgently act to save those species for which some chance still remains,” Jaric says. In the study team’s survey, they didn’t find another 140 species that they hoped to see, and some of these deserve much more attention to determine their conservation status, Wei says.

“Extinction risk assessments for all endangered Yangtze species should be conducted as soon as possible,” he says.

Furthermore, activities like fishing and dam construction deserve more scrutiny—as well as efforts to mitigate impacts of development, such as fish ladders.","Chinese paddlefish, one of the world's largest fish, declared extinct",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEATjLZse6eLvGV4hA6BtejcqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowmrWECzDc_IADMP7SgwY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/2020/chinese-paddlefish/01-chinese-paddlefish-unknown-1.ngsversion.1578510127272.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2020-01-08,"{'sent': 'The species, reaching up to 23 feet in length, survived unimaginable changes and upheavals, such as the mass extinction that killed the dinosaurs and marine reptiles like plesiosaurs that it swam alongside.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['up to 23 feet']}}",Chinese Crocodile Lizard
0,"The pangolin is similar to the size of a raccoon and looks like an artichoke with legs. Its head and body are covered with an armor of thorny scales, giving it the appearance of a reptile. When a pangolin is scared, it curls up into a tight ball.

The pangolin is said to be the most widely trafficked mammal in the world. Its scales are in huge demand in Asia to use of traditional Chinese medicine, despite there being no medical benefit for their use, while its meat is considered a delicacy in some countries.

Jonathan Baillie, a pangolin specialist at the International Union for Conservation of Nature in London said, “All eight species of this animal, which is found over large parts of Africa and Asia, are facing extinction.” He said, “The demand for the pangolins actually lies in China and Vietnam,” “And the Asian pangolin, particularly the Chinese pangolin, has basically been completely wiped out.”

The animal has long been prized for its scales, which are used in traditional Chinese medicine. But Baillie says nowadays, pangolin meat is considered a luxury item by a growing middle class as well particularly in Vietnam and China.

“We’re seeing that the body is actually being eaten as some sort of celebration when a business deal is done,” he says. “The price can go up to many hundreds of dollars per kilo.”

As the number of Asian species declines, Baillie says, there is an increasing demand for African pangolins. International trade of the African species is allowed with the right paperwork. But they’re being poached and sent to Asian markets at an alarming rate.

Believed to be world’s most trafficked non human Mammal 🙁

A Pangolin is one of the most shy & is harmless.

All 8 species of Pangolin classified as threatened with extinction by IUCN.

2 are classified as critically endangered .

Pangolin products are showing up in the U.S. as well. Part of the problem is the pangolin doesn’t have a high profile like the elephant or rhino, so it’s easier to slip the live animal or its byproducts past customs officials, says Luke Bond, a criminal intelligence officer with Interpol’s environmental crime program.

An effort is on to list all eight species under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, and another to make it illegal to trade the pangolin under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), the multilateral treaty to protect endangered animals.",World Pangolin Day 2020: How does Pangolins look?

KATHMANDU: In fact, Nepal needs no introduction when you talk about mountaineering, typography, culture, people, flora and faunas and its natural beauty.

Nepal got its Himalayan exposure worldwide with Sir Edmund Hillary, New Zealander’s ascent of Mt Everest on May 29, 1953, with Tenjing Norgey Sherpa.

“While on top of Everest, I looked across the valley towards the great peak Makalu and mentally worked out a route about how it could be climbed. It showed me that even though I was standing on top of the world, it wasn’t the end of everything. I was still looking beyond to other interesting challenges.”

This and many such Everest experiences from the climbers like Edmund Hillary turned pivotal in drawing the world to the celestial beauty of the Himalayas.

‘Mountains are calling’, the theme Visit Nepal 2020 set to represent the appealing mountains is expected to tempt the nature lovers to the pristine beauty of this heavenly land.

Imagine if these 1.2 million visitors of 2019 manage to send two persons from their side in 2020, the target will be met easily.

Obviously, they must have told the story of their Nepal visit to their friends, relatives, colleagues.

Taken this way, Nepal is known to many by now. However, in this world of glamour and advertisement, we have failed to sell their experiences as well.

Most of the places hold the feedback diary to help the travelers share their experience, how much are we prepared to listen to both the appreciating and criticizing remarks of the visitors coming to Nepal?

Do we dare to ask them to comment freely? Can we make such provisions? Have we arranged for the feedback desk at the entry point and point of departure? How effective is our luggage security system?

Do we dare to make the action taken against those who steal the luggage in our custom? Do we have some officials analyzing both the negative and positive comments made on social media?

We need a good conversation with them to encourage them to revisit and recommend others to visit Nepal.

Although the number of tourists in Nepal is increasing each year, listening to them might help us multiply it.

Records of the previous year show that 1.17 million visited Nepal in 2018 when the number was only 940 thousand in the year 2017. In 2016 the number was merely 713 thousand.

The project demands much better initiative to meet the target. The tourists complain of various frustrating experiences in Nepal ranging from the poor infrastructure to the rescue and relief in case of disaster and many other things.

Nepal has organized different programs in all provinces and the international arena. Promotional programs have so far been organized in various cities like Doha, Beijing, Pretoria, Paris, Ottawa, Yangon, Kuala Lumpur, Sydney, Dhaka, Islamabad, Cairo.

Infrastructure expert Kishor Thapa criticizes the government for not paying enough attention to the infrastructure building. Visitors come here for the culture, nature, and adventure of Nepal. Hence, experts want to draw the attention of the government towards the infrastructure.

Similarly, Sudarshan Raj Tiwari, an archeologist thinks the snail-paced heritage reconstruction might impact the tourist flow. “The loss and damage on the cultural heritage sites are most likely to have an adverse impact on the government target of getting 2 million tourists into the country in 2019,” Tiwari told Khabarhub.

However, Sanu Sherpa, 44, a successful mountaineer with the record of being the third Nepali to climb all 14 peaks above 8,000 meters, has a different view. He refutes the importance of infrastructure development.

To him, roads and other facilities do not affect the influx of tourists in the country as the tourists come here for the adventure and life-time experience. Hence, he thinks, we should give priority to the publicity of the destinations and the safety of the tourists.

Dan Thompson, a British businessman and a sports enthusiast says travel is the discovery of truth; an affirmation of the promise that humankind is far more beautiful than it is flawed. With each trip comes to a new optimism that where there are despair and hardship, there are ideas and people just waiting to be energized, to be empowered, to make a difference for good.

Hence, As Frank A. Clark says if you can find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn’t lead anywhere.”

We have to showcase some of the destinations where people will dare to reach. Here we have summarized the popular destination of each province of Nepal.

Province One

Province One includes a diverse topography ranging from the country’s lowest point, that is, Kechana Kalan at 60m, to the world’s highest, that is, Mt. Everest at 8848m. The geographical variety is suitable for a lot of adventure activities.

Lucrative locations and magnetic attractions make Province One a perfect venue for hundreds of world-class tourism activities.

Nepal is a Himalayan country that habitats major peaks of the world including the world’s rooftop Mt. Everest (8848m), the third tallest peak Kanchenjunga (8586m), fourth tallest peak Lhotse (8516m) and fifth tallest peak Makalu (8463m). Owing to the availability of best and tallest mountains on the planet, mountaineering in East Nepal is attractive to all mountaineers around the globe.

Similarly, Province One is a sort of trekking paradise with a picturesque Himalayan backdrop and wow-worthy cultural and natural beauties. From Himalayan trekking of Everest Base Camp, Kanchenjunga Base Camp, and Makalu Base Camp to the mid-hill cultural trail of Mundhum, East Nepal has a variety of trekking tracks.

What’s more! Province One falls in the beautiful section of 1700 kilometer long Great Himalayan Trail starting from Kanchenjunga to Everest. Jungle safari in this province was commercially introduced in December 2016 at Kosi Tappu Wildlife. The jungle safari was introduced by Sechha Travelling Dharan. However, it came to an end after the Wild elephant terror at Koshi Tappu.

In rivers, there are the best rafting rivers like Tamor, Arun, and Sunkoshi.

Province Two

There are dozens of historical, religious and cultural sites in Province Two. Janaki Mandir, dedicated to Hindu goddess Sita, is a Hindu temple in Janakpur in the Mithila region of Nepal. It is an example of Hindu-Koiri Nepali architecture. It is often considered the most important model of Koiri architecture in Nepal.

Known for the sacrificial slaughters of thousands of animals, the Gadhimai is one of the famous destinations in Province 2. Despite the outcry of the animal rights activists, the deep-rooted belief that animal sacrifice can help family members ward off the evil influence has been catalytic in the continuation of the practice.

Similarly, Parsa National Park has enriched its beauty to Province Two which is a protected area established in 1984. It gives a rare opportunity to experience natural beauties. It shelters a different number of animals, plants, flora and faunas.

Parsa Wildlife Reserve provides habitat for 500 species of birds. The national park is famous for reptiles and snakes like cobra, python, king cobra, etc. The park has a good population of rare animals like the Asian elephant, Royal Bengal tiger, leopard, wild dog, musk deer, sambar deer, sloth bear, hyena, jungle cat, etc.

Likewise, Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, Nunthar, Jaleshwornath, Dhanusha Dham, BaBa Tal are other famous tourist destinations of Province 2.

Province Three

Province Three compromises high hill stations, plain stiff lands and cultural villages. This province compromises the best trekking trails including Gauri Shankar, Ganesh Trekking, Jugal, Gonjala Pass, Langtang-Gosaikunda and others. Similarly, there is the Chitwan National park, one of the famous places for bird and animal lovers and where one can enjoy the trips with a jungle safari.

Inside the Kathmandu Valley, there is Shivapuri National Park which is famous for day hiking routes. The hike offers a great walking tour experience in its natural forest that spread over the summit of 2730 m.

If you are in love with archaeological monuments, there are Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur Durbar squares which reveal various facts about the history of Nepal.

Province Four (Gandaki Province)

In terms of natural beauty, culture and adventure tourism, Gandaki Province tops the list. Trekking, mountaineering and tour are the main sources of revenue of the Province. Gandaki Province got wider exposure when the French climbers Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal climbed Annapurna on June 3, 1950.

In fact, Gandaki Province does not need any introduction as around 45% percent of tourist who comes to Nepal reach this province in their holidays in Nepal.

The famous and beautiful city Pokhara which is the gateway to Machhapuchhe, Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Manaslu Conservation Area, Poonhill, Ghandruk and other famous tourist destinations all entice the visitors.

Phewa Lake, Begnas Lake, Rupa Lake, Tilicho Lake, Seti River, Mahendra Cave, David’s Falls, Manang, Mustang, Muktinath and others are in the Province.

Province Five

Province Five consists of the sacred place Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha. It is considered as one of the world’s most important spiritual sites, which attracts both the Buddhist and Hindu pilgrims around the world.

Mayadevi Temple is the most sacred site in the Lumbini Garden where the archaeologists have identified the exact spot where Lord Buddha was born. Inscriptions on the Ashoka Pillar nearby also refer to the spot as his birthplace.

It is said that the newly born Prince Siddhartha (later became the Buddha) took his first seven steps and delivered his peace message to humanity here.

For religious tourism Sworgadwari is another major destination in Province Five. Sworgadwari which literally means door to heaven resides on top of the hill on Pyuthan district at the elevation of 6,960 meters from sea level Pious and serene place believed to be a holy place where Panch Pandavas performed meditation, it is a must-go religious place for Hindus.

Similarly, if you love to see the historical place, the Rani Mahal is another place. This building is a Rana palace located in the bank of Kali Gandaki River in Palpa district of Nepal. Also known as the Taj Mahal of Nepal, this palace was constructed by General Khadga Samsher Jung Bahadur Rana in 1893.

Bardiya National Park, another must-visit in the Province Five, is one of the most pristine conservation areas in the Tarai and is home to the endangered Royal Bengal tiger and Nepal’s famous One-horned rhinoceros besides countless other mammals and reptiles.

The national park is covered with vast Sal and riverine forests and tall elephant grass, making it an ideal habitat for many kinds of animals that roam freely. The park hosts 30 species of mammals, more than 250 species of birds, and several varieties of reptiles.

There are more sightings of tigers here than in other national parks. Thousands of visitors come repeatedly to catch a glimpse of the elusive cat.

Some of the other animals found here are elephants, swamp deer, blackbuck, gharials, and marsh-muggers. The exotic Gangetic dolphin is also sometimes seen along the surface of the Karnali. Birds found here include endangered species like the Bengal florican, lesser florican, silver eared mesia and the sarus crane.

Apart from these, the small mountains, plain lands, cultural and heritage sites also help to boost Province Five.

Province Six (Karnali Province)

It has been said that if you visit Karnali, you will visit the whole country.

Karnali Province is considered as Nepal’s most remote part. Despite the poor infrastructure, the province’s sublime natural beauty is vast. Feels like God has given everything to Karnali. That’s why tourists love to visit this place.

This province also boasts of having Rara Lake – Nepal’s largest lake – situated at an altitude of 2990 meters. Besides, Rara National Park in the province surrounded by alpine coniferous vegetation shelters more than 500 different kinds of flowers, 20 species of mammals and 214 species of birds.

Not to forget the Bulbul Tal, Kakre Bihar, Patarasi Himal, Panchpuri Circuit, Limi Vally, Kot Palace, Upper Dolpa, Sisne Himal, Shey-Phoksundo, and Tripura Sundari, among other places which are also considered a ‘must visit’ in a lifetime.

Province Seven (Sudur Paschhim Province)

The Sudur Paschhim Province (Province-7) comprises deep forest, majestic mountains, plain lands, wildlife areas and cultural heritage.

Shuklaphanta National Park, Mount Api, Khaptad, Ugratara Temple, Tikapur Park, Dhodhara Chadani Suspension Bridge, Ghodagodi Tal, Badimalika, and Karnali Bridge are some of the major spots to see.

In fact, Nepal has more to offer besides these listed destinations such as distinct culture, weather, people, lifestyle, way of living, and languages that vary in every province.

0,"The sight of burning elephant ivory stock is a spectacle of pyrrhic defeat. Above, there are pillars of smoke and flecks of red embers; below, pyramids of elephant tusks blackening in flames — hollow, charred remnants of slain icons.

Destruction of ivory stock is but one of many measures that governments, law enforcement agencies, and anti-poaching organizations have adopted to combat the illegal trade of wildlife goods, following the guidance of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species and other international wildlife policy. They work to manage poaching where species decline has been severe over the last several decades. But on the ground, poaching draws entire communities into rings of organized crime that exact pernicious environmental tolls. It can feel like one is fighting a never-ebbing blaze.

Two years have passed since China’s momentous ivory ban. Its effectiveness — and its shortcomings — speaks to the current and future status of wildlife crime, and calls for an investigation of all of the links in its twisted supply chain. Taking ivory and several other illicit wildlife goods as examples, we can understand the source of the flames.

Origins of Demand

The social origins of the demand for wildlife goods weave together strands of class, culture, and tradition, skewed by an abrupt transition into a modern context. In an interview with the HPR, Wander Meijer, director of GlobeScan, explained: “Ivory has always been used everywhere in the world by rich people as a sign of status. Why it has become such a big issue now is because it has been democratized. A lot more people are actually buying the products because they can afford it.”

Some goods are believed to have additional medicinal or curative properties. Rhino horn’s speculated medicinal properties are loosely defined, its appeal coming from a combination of social allure — wealthy buyers may choose to display or carve rhino horn rather than consume it — and erroneous traditional beliefs. Another victim is the totoaba, a large, endangered fish inhabiting Mexico’s Sea of Cortés: Its swim bladder, a fleshy organ falsely attributed curative powers, is valuable enough to earn it the nickname “la cocaine del mar” — cocaine of the sea.

As the ivory ban and awareness campaigns have been enacted across China, opinions do seem to be shifting, according to GlobeScan’s September survey. Nearly 80 percent of respondents said they would not purchase ivory. What is troubling, though, is the 14 percent who said they would. Demand and consumption over the past year has risen within a small yet persistent demographic of patrons who evade Chinese wildlife trade laws by buying in countries with less stringent policies, such as Thailand, Hong Kong, and Cambodia. “If I walk across the Hong Kong-China border, and bring a few small ivory artifacts with me, like trinkets, nobody will check me, and nobody will notice it,” Meijer says. “The enforcement is not as stringent as people thought.”

China is the world’s biggest travel market — next year, 200 million Chinese people will go abroad. “The only demographic which showed an increase in both the demand for ivory and the purchase of ivory are travellers,” Meijer said. “If they go abroad to countries around China, people may not even have the intention to buy ivory, but what happens in practice is that they go to souvenir shops and it is offered to them.”

There is also the prospect of speculation. Stockpilers in Africa, China, and Southeast Asia “are betting on either elephants going extinct … or one day, for whatever reason, the market reopening in China. Again, in both cases you will have ivory there already, stockpiled like gold,” explained Andrea Crosta, a wildlife crime investigator, in an interview with the HPR. Furthermore, even if demand does not increase, poachers may kill more in anticipation of rising prices, hoping to make elephants even more rare so that each tusk might fetch a higher price as elephant tusks grow sparse. The same phenomenon allegedly occurs with totoaba bladders, which are often traded and used as a sort of currency, a gold standard.

The Supply Chain

Organized wildlife crime drastically transforms the societies in which it operates. With its many links, it is the most tenacious part of the chain. The trade of coveted wildlife goods provides an enticing source of income for communities. A single totoaba bladder can generate thousands of dollars for a fisherman, and tens of thousands of dollars for a trafficker in the Chinese black market. This source of income is conditional: Fishermen provide the goods in exchange for a small percentage of the market value as well as weapons and ammunition, fishing nets, and other appliances loaned with the understanding that the poachers are responsible for them, thus creating a vicious system of economic and social reliance.

The 2019 documentary Sea of Shadows revealed the degree to which crime organizations exploiting the totoaba trade have infiltrated the lives of fishermen on the Sea of Cortés. Traffickers have not simply drawn fishermen into fishing illegal totoaba. They have monopolized the waters so that legal fishermen cannot compete, thus causing even more fishermen to turn to poaching. Once fishermen are enveloped in the trade, syndicates lend them expensive equipment, such as fishing nets and weapons, controlling them through debt as well as through profit. The documentarian Richard Ladkani, who directed the film, recounted the consequences he witnessed firsthand in an interview with the HPR: “They are being extorted … One fisherman we interviewed in the film lost 16 nets, worth about $54,000. Then he went public with it, and started to rebel against the cartel, saying he couldn’t pay them back, so they killed him.”

The role of traffickers and mafias is often overlooked. No one knows the nature of these players better than Andrea Crosta. As the world’s leading wildlife crime investigator and head of Earth League International, he described the difference between the arrests of a key poacher — in this example, the Tanzanian poacher “Shetani” — and a key trafficker, the Chinese kingpin Yang Fenlan, known as the “Ivory Queen.”

“Shetani was one of the most important players in the first part of the supply chain. Someone like him still needs a trader to sell what he has and continue the supply chain,” Crosta said. “It’s not easy to replace someone like Shetani, but it’s not impossible. To replace someone like the Ivory Queen is a lot more difficult. This is why we have been advocating for years asking law enforcement and governments to go upstream in the supply chain and focus on people like the Ivory Queen … who know how to buy, how to smuggle, how to put together containers or shipments, avoid Chinese customs, and keep in contact with the buyers.”

It is important not to exaggerate the role poverty plays in causing poaching. “You have many, many cases [like San Felipe] around the world: they are not rich, but they do survive, they are not poor … what changes the equation are traffickers,” Crosta explained. “One must understand the disturbance and temptation factor that the traffickers bring into communities … If, tomorrow, you were to give jobs to [the whole population] of San Felipe, you would still have totoaba trafficking. Already, now, fishermen come not from the area, but from all around Mexico. It’s like a gold rush.”

Mafias, of course, impede justice. Paying off border and customs officials, according to investigators, allows elephant ivory to pour out of ports such as Dar-es-Salaam and Mombasa. In a recent crackdown on the Shuidong syndicate, shipments of ivory smuggled with mixed lower-quality goods were checked by customs at a rate of only one in 20 shipments on their journey from Tanzania to Zanzibar and eventually to Asia.

Corruption taints the legal arena as well. A recent case in Thailand against a powerful Vietnamese rhino horn smuggler, Boonchai Bach, was dropped due to the sudden recantation of a key testimony. Experts believe that the witness had been financially incentivized or threatened. This is one of many wildlife criminal cases that have been abandoned under suspicious circumstances; a similar case against nine Chinese pangolin traffickers arrested in Mozambique was dropped just this past month.

Even rebel militias like the Lord’s Resistance Army fund and operate using ivory profit. The challenge is thus political as well. Poachers in many sites oppose conservation measures that would endanger the crime syndicates that control them, or endanger their ability to poach, as observed in protests in response to fishing net bans in San Felipe.

Stemming the Demand

GlobeScan’s September survey on the demand for ivory after the ban found that the majority of people in China, excluding the die-hard buyer group, have been significantly discouraged from buying ivory due to the ban itself as well as the social awareness campaigns accompanying it. Respondents report that the most effective deterrent is the fear of elephants’ extinction. Additional bans and more broadly disseminated social awareness campaigns reaching a wider audience can further change social norms around buying wildlife goods in China.

Yet while awareness campaigns and legal deterrents are essential drivers for generational change, Crosta argued that we may not be able to buy enough time for such measures alone to succeed. “Awareness campaigns are a very long-term strategy in China. But the majority of the species, the environmental emergencies that we have right now — we are talking about five, 10 years max. There is no time for awareness campaigns of this kind to solve these problems. The strategy must be different.”

Breaking the Chain

Crosta is co-founder and executive director of Earth League International and WildLeaks, organizations of wildlife crime investigators that perform undercover work to gather incriminating data on wildlife crime syndicates. He argued in The Daily Beast that the role of intelligence in disrupting the connection between poachers and final buyers is a key method for dismantling the trade altogether, but one many conservationists and policymakers have ignored.

“It’s in our mission to help law enforcement and inform the public, but we want to do it only with firsthand facts — information collected by our people, analyzed by our crime analysts, double-checked with our cyber experts. With these firsthand facts, you can hold governments accountable,” he told the HPR. Through undercover investigations using sophisticated intelligence techniques, ELI and WildLeaks have been able to gather data on ivory dealers, totoaba dealers, and players at many levels of supply chains worldwide, providing them at no cost to authorities who are able to use such data for arrest warrants and prosecutions. This, Crosta said, is an invaluable tool in keeping governments informed. “In the case of totoaba, for example, when we share information with [the Mexican authorities], we make it clear that we are sharing the exact same information with U.S. and Chinese authorities.”

Usually such authorities are responsive. “A year and a half ago, the Thai authorities arrested two of the most important wildlife traffickers in the region thanks to our work. Since environmental crime is not a big priority, they don’t have a lot of resources. But when we give them the information to do what they have to do, they like it — this is the best way to establish relations with law enforcement agencies.” Still, data alone cannot fix the entire problem.

A Political Solution

Meijer, Crosta, and Ladkani agree on one fundamental truth: as Andrea Crosta put it, “a political solution is everything.” Ladkani confirmed: “Frontline anti-poaching efforts will always only buy us time.” But what exactly does a political solution look like?

The 2017 ban is an example of sound wildlife policy. But its enforcement is another story. “What happened in China is that all of a sudden, it is way more difficult to launder illegal ivory into the system. It became a problem of law enforcement. Take rhino horn — rhino has been illegal in China for years. It’s not a legal problem,” Crosta said of the ban.

Fortunately, hope is dawning at the intersection of arts, media and journalism. Take Richard Ladkani’s environmental documentaries. In 2017, his film documenting the illicit ivory trade, The Ivory Game, was released in theaters and to millions of viewers on Netflix. The subsequent impact was drastic. “Two months after the film came out, China announced they would ban the trade of ivory … the day they announced the ban, they invited us to the Beijing Film Festival, where we opened the festival and won for best documentary.”

This summer, Ladkani’s Sea of Shadows was released. It was distributed through National Geographic, shared by powerful partners such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Jane Goodall, and screened worldwide, putting significant pressure on the Chinese, Mexican, and U.S. governments to crack down on totoaba trafficking and save the vaquitas. The documentary’s poster animal, the vaquita is the world’s smallest whale species, reduced to dwindling populations as they are caught and drowned in totoaba nets.

The film has made a positive impact so far, but Ladkani is keeping vigilant. “There were some very big announcements that the Mexican government is intending to send 600 additional troops to the area — soldiers, observers, monitors, analysts — to help save the vaquita. The Mexican president has talked about the vaquita for the first time. The incoming governor of Baja California wants additional screenings there so it can become more of a public discussion. The media response was the biggest ever for a documentary in Mexico. But totoaba season is about to begin in November. We will see, starting then, how effective the government crackdown will be. We’re afraid it’s just for show. If they don’t really … make poachers suffer, then nothing will change.”

The solution may lie directly with us, the millions of viewers and social media users with media platforms at our disposal. When it comes to saving our species and communities, incriminating data on wildlife crime is the key, the lighter fluid with which we can douse those in power. But data alone, Ladkani said, is not enough. “People need to understand that the traditional way of conservation is game over. We are losing the war almost everywhere, and the criminals are laughing. And I want outrage.” Clearly, Ladkani’s efforts and the efforts of the fighters he documents cannot exist in a void. Public outrage is the catalyst — it is the spark.",Tooth and Nail: The Fight for Species in a World of Wildlife Crime,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vaGFydmFyZHBvbGl0aWNzLmNvbS93b3JsZC90b290aC1hbmQtbmFpbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://harvardpolitics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Mari_World_Tooth-and-Nail.jpg,2020-01-12,"{'sent': 'Destruction of ivory stock is but one of many measures that governments, law enforcement agencies, and anti-poaching organizations have adopted to combat the illegal trade of wildlife goods, following the guidance of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species and other international wildlife policy.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one'], 'ORG': ['the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species']}}",Pangolin

Officials stand next to rocks believed to contain basalt.

Officials stand next to rocks believed to contain basalt. Environment Ministry

The Ministry of Environment is planning to designate a conservation status to an area rich in basalt rocks and wildlife in Mondulkiri province, an official said.

The revelation came after a team of environment officials visited an area known as a spirit forest by Bunong minorities, adjacent to Phnom Nam Lear wildlife sanctuary in Pich Chreada district’s Bousra commune last week.

Loeung Kesaro, director of heritage park department at the Environment Ministry, yesterday said that the officials surveyed the area in Bousra commune’s Sala Pram village and found it abundant with basalt rocks.

Mr Kesaro said the officials could not determine the age of the rocks, but said they could be thousands years.

He said the area could be turned into a tourist destination and conservation zone.

“The area is rich in natural resources and we should protect it,” he said.

Mr Kesaro said thousands of basalt rocks are scattered in the sprawling area along with wildlife.

“It deserves to be a natural heritage and conservation site,” he said, adding he is writing a document to submit to minister Say Samal for approval.

“We will wait for an approval and advice from the minister because we will submit all the documents to him this week,” he said.

If the plan is approved by Mr Samal, Mr Kesaro said his team will visit the area again and demarcate its boundary.

Vuth Sarom, director of Phnom Nam Lear wildlife sanctuary, yesterday said that most of the basalt rocks are between 0.4 metres to 0.6 metre wide and 1.5 to 2 metres long.

“This place is rich in natural resources and wildlife. It is very priceless,” Mr Sarom said.",Ministry aims to give basalt-rich area conservation status,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtobWVydGltZXNraC5jb20vNTA2Nzk0MDMvbWluaXN0cnktYWltcy10by1naXZlLWJhc2FsdC1yaWNoLWFyZWEtY29uc2VydmF0aW9uLXN0YXR1cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.khmertimeskh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/MoEnviroment-4.jpg,2020-01-13,"{'sent': 'Environment Ministry\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Environment Ministry']}}",Chinese Crocodile Lizard

The giant salamander, billed as 'the living fossil', is one of the world's oldest animal species dating back more than 170 million years. There are very few of them left in the wild.

The passenger claimed that the pair of giant salamanders were artificially bred and she was bringing them home to cook.

The picture shows one of the giant salamanders intercepted by railway police in Zhangjiajie, China, on January 13. A female passenger tried to bring two such creatures onto a bullet train

The traveller was stopped by police after officers saw the creatures on their X-ray screen. Police told the press that the amphibious beasts are a protected animal species in China and authority had strict control over them, even if they were raised on a farm

Police told the press that the amphibious beasts are a protected animal species in China and authority had strict control over them, even if they were raised on a farm.

The giant salamander is listed as 'critically endangered' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

The incident was reported by Chinese news outlet Pear Video.

According to the report, the giant salamanders were sealed in two styrofoam boxes when the unnamed passenger stuck them into a baggage X-ray machine on Monday at the West High-speed Railway Station of Zhangjiajie, a city in southern China's Hunan Province.

She was stopped after officers saw the creatures on their screen.

A police officer is seen checking the boxes after finding them suspicious during security screening. The woman claimed that she wanted to eat them to help her recover from surgery

It is believed by some Chinese people that giant salamanders have anti-ageing benefits, although there is no scientific evidence to support this.

But the woman claimed that she wanted to eat them to help her recover from surgery.

She told police: '[I bought them] at an official breeding base. [I] bought [them] to boost my health. I just underwent an operation.'

The giant salamander is listed as 'critically endangered' on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and a protected animal species in China (file photo)

Yue Yin, a police officer, told Pear: 'The giant salamander is a second class protected species in our country. Even the artificially bred ones have their individual record with the authority.'

Officer Yue said that the woman's purchases were confirmed to have come from a breeder instead of the wild.

While hunting, killing and trading wild giant salamanders can lead to more than 10 years of imprisonment in China, trading or consuming artificially bred ones is legal.

In the end, the police helped the woman send the giant salamanders home by post after telling her live animals, except for guide dogs, were not allowed on the train.",Train passenger is caught trying to sneak two giant salamanders through security checks,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEDWKDvaKItHBZdNS6mbdHZQqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowzuOICzCZ4ocDMO7xqQY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2020/01/17/12/23519968-0-image-a-12_1579263100369.jpg,2020-01-17,"{'sent': 'A woman in China has been caught trying to sneak two live giant salamanders through security checks at a train station after buying the rare animals for their meat, according to reports.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China'], 'CARDINAL': ['two']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

BEIJING -- Chinese authorities announced a temporary ban on the trade of wild animals Sunday after a viral outbreak in Wuhan, saying they will ""severely investigate and punish"" violators.

Local authorities will ""strengthen inspections and severely investigate and punish those who are found in violation of the provisions of this announcement,"" read the ban issued by three government agencies.

No wildlife can be transported or sold in any markets or online, according to text of the announcement in state media. Suspected violators will be sent to security services, and their properties will be closed and sealed. Legal breeding centers will be quarantined.

The ban will continue until ""the epidemic situation is lifted nationwide,"" in order to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus and block potential sources of infection and transmission.

China's government said today that it is extending its Lunar New Year holiday by three more days to discourage people from traveling.

Tens of millions of Chinese who visited their hometowns or tourist spots were due to return home this week, raising the risk the virus might spread in crowded trains and planes.

The official end of the holiday will be pushed back from Friday to Sunday to ""effectively reduce mass gatherings"" and ""block the spread of the epidemic,"" a Cabinet statement said.

Three agencies have opened a hotline where people can report wildlife violations, and they called on the public to refrain from eating wild animal meat. The agencies are the State Administration of Market Regulation, Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs and the National Forestry and Grassland Administration.

""Consumers should fully understand the health risks of eating wild animals, stay away from 'game' and eat healthily,"" said the regulations.

But the regulations will remain in place only while China grapples with the epidemic, raising the question of whether the wildlife trade will be allowed to bounce back, as it did after an initial clampdown after the SARS outbreak.

Christian Walzer, chief global veterinarian at the Wildlife Conservation Society, called the measure an ""important first step"" but said the ban needs to be permanent.

""The pattern will keep repeating itself until we ban, not only in China, but in other countries, the sale of wildlife, specifically for food and in food markets,"" he said in a statement.

SPREADING IN CHINA

The wildlife ban comes as the new virus accelerated its spread in China with 80 deaths, and 2,744 infections. China cut off trains, planes and other links to Wuhan on Wednesday, as well as public transportation within the city, and has steadily expanded a lockdown to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million -- greater than that of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined.

Demand for wild animals in Asia, especially China, is hastening the extinction of many species, on top of posing a perennial health threat that authorities have failed to fully address despite growing risks of a global pandemic.

Peter Knights, founder of WildAid, said the current crisis might have been averted if the ban after SARS had been permanent. ""Surely it's time for an advanced country like China to reassess the viability of a tiny industry that risks global pandemic, national image, animal cruelty and conservation concerns,"" he said.

In an earlier response to the crisis in Wuhan, China's Agriculture Ministry issued an order for tightened controls on trade in wildlife.

A group of 19 prominent researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the nation's top universities had called for the government in China to crack down on wildlife markets such as the one at the center of the Wuhan outbreak.

Illegal trade flourishes in ""loopholes"" of the legal wildlife trade in China and increases the probability of an outbreak, the group wrote in an open letter posted on Weibo. ""This is the hidden danger for the trade and consumption"" of wild animals, the letter read. They advocate vastly increasing on-site inspections and government oversight of all wildlife markets.

Zoonotic diseases, or those contracted by humans that originated in other species, account for a large share of human infectious illnesses. Not all of them come from the wildlife trade: rabies is endemic across many species and one of the biggest causes of death in the developing world. But mixing species of wild animals increases the risk of diseases mutating and growing more virulent as they spread in unregulated markets, experts say.

The emergence of such diseases is a ""numbers game,"" Walzer said.

""If these markets persist, and human consumption of illegal and unregulated wildlife persists, then the public will continue to face heightened risks from emerging new viruses, potentially more lethal and the source of future pandemic spread,"" he said. ""These are perfect laboratories for creating opportunities for these viruses to emerge.""

Researchers have not yet announced a definitive source for this latest outbreak, which like many other viruses can infect multiple species.

One of the first measures taken by Wuhan authorities was to close down the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where 41 of the first cases originated.

Despite its name, the market was selling a huge variety of wild animals for consumption, including live cats and dogs, turtles, snakes, rats, hedgehogs and marmots. Menus and signboards posted online showed a huge variety of wild animals available to eat, including foxes, wolf cubs, monkeys and cat-like masked palm civets.

The city government closed the seafood market at the beginning of January after many of the first cases of coronavirus emerged in people working there.

""That's the big black box right now,"" said Jon Epstein, an epidemiologist with the Ecohealth Alliance.

He was in China after the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which was traced to consumption of wild animals in the southern city of Guangzhou. Epstein helped the ongoing global effort over nearly two decades to find the wild source of that virus, which sickened more than 8,000 people and killed less than 800. SARS has been linked to various animals, including bats and the civets.

Bats are known to harbor coronaviruses, but scientists have yet to fully understand the new virus and how it leapt from animals to people.

Epstein said researchers suspect but haven't proved that the Wuhan virus came from bats. Before it infected humans, it likely first jumped to an as yet unidentified mammal.

The crackdown on wildlife trafficking and sales persisted only about six months after the SARS outbreak faded in mid-2003, Walzer said.

WILD FLAVORS ABUNDANT

In cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, there's little sign of markets catering to gourmands seeking ""ye wei,"" or ""wild flavors.""

But in provincial cities and in some parts of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries, those determined to eat such exotic dishes can find all sorts of creatures for sale: pangolins, badgers, salamanders, scorpions, hedgehogs and even wolf puppies.

China remains a major consumer of wild and endangered animals for meat, as well as for traditional medicine. But medical and wildlife experts hope this epidemic will help to change attitudes.

In a commentary published Friday, state China Central Television condemned the consumption of wild animals and called the new coronavirus a ""game meat virus.""

""It rankles that some people out there are obsessed about game meat and eat to their heart's content because of gluttony and greed,"" it said. ""They harvested this evil fruit, making a whole city, a whole country, and even the entire human race pay such a heavy price; and the worst is yet to come.""

The strongly worded piece asked whether those ""who love to eat, poach, and trade wild animals have been shaken by this, are feeling the least guilty conscience, or have confessed to their wrongdoing deep down,"" and lamented that the illegal trade in wild animals was not closed after SARS.

""Some people are still taking chances and opening the Pandora's box again and again,"" it added. ""How can we be so forgetful?""

Court records show that authorities in Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located, investigated 250 cases related to wildlife trafficking and poaching in 2019. According to local media reports, since 2018 an estimated 16,000 wild animals were hunted in the province of more than 60 million people.

Hubei is home to Shennongjia, a UNESCO World Heritage nature reserve that is a habitat of great biodiversity with many rare species including the clouded leopard, golden snub-nosed monkey and the Chinese giant salamander.

In most cases, vendors are registered to sell some unprotected species, usually a limited amount of just a few, such as hares, wild boar and muntjac, a kind of tiny deer.

But enforcement is ""not that strict,"" said Tian Jiang Ming of the Anti-Poaching Squad, a group of volunteers who visit markets are report on illegal wildlife sales. The illegal offerings tend to be kept hidden away in back freezers, he said.

Only in 2014 did China criminalize consumption of protected species with a law specifying a maximum three-year jail term. But it also has allowed commercial farming of certain species, including tigers -- a practice that conservation advocates say encourages illicit trafficking in protected species.

Paignton Zoo in Devon has hatched three very special – and very beautiful - Chinese crocodile lizards.

In 2018, Paignton Zoo became the first major zoological collection in the UK to breed this species.

You may not be familiar with the Chinese crocodile lizard - and there's a very good reason for that. This small, semiaquatic lizard is found only in the provinces of southern China and northern Vietnam.

It’s listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List due to severe population declines and habitat threats.

They grow to around 40 to 46 centimetres (16 to 18 inches) in length and can be very colourful, with yellow, orange and red patterning and delicate bands of light and dark.

Jay Redbond, Paignton Zoo’s Assistant Curator of Lower Vertebrates and Invertebrates, said: "" The key to success with reptiles is having a good breeding pair and giving them suitable seasonal variations in temperature and humidity.

""We have a good semi-naturalistic setup with a large area of water.”

""The three have been separated from the parents to rear individually. This means we can keep track of the individuals as they grow and also gives us a much better chance of getting them all through to adulthood.

""This way, we can give them individual care so they are not competing with each other.”

The current breeding pair are on loan from Whipsnade Zoo and will return there later in the year, but Paignton Zoo will keep the babies.

The species is not currently on show, but Jay has plans, saying: “I want to develop a Vietnam focused exhibit in the entrance to Reptile Tropics for 2021 which will be perfect for when the babies are bigger.”

The Chinese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus) has bony scales down its back and a muscular tail that resembles that of a crocodile.

It’s likely just a few hundreds survive in the wild in China and Vietnam.

Karnataka police continues to face the flak for their actions

No space for dissent?

The Karnataka police continues to earn the ire of people around the country by questioning young students of the Shaheen Primary & High School in Bidar for the fifth time in connection with a play, staged in January, that was allegedly critical of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Charges of sedition were also slapped on the school head teacher and a student’s mother.

Another case of censorship came to light in the Capital when an exhibit by the Post Art Project, showcasing performances and paintings inspired by the women of Shaheen Bagh, was closed at the India Art Fair after complaints to Delhi Police. While the fair organizers claimed not all details of the activities at the booth had been shared in advance, the artists maintained they had done so, and that the work was not inflammatory in any way—it only expressed solidarity and celebrated the strength of women. —AB

Indian government plans to introduce cheetahs from Namibia (Photo: iStock)

Return of the big cat

Nearly 70 years after cheetahs became extinct, the government is planning to reintroduce them—by importing them from Namibia. The Supreme Court had ruled against the proposal in 2011, expressing concerns about the relocation of a foreign species in unfamiliar terrain. Last week, a new bench led by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde gave the go ahead on an “experimental basis"" to gauge their adaptability. Some see it as a victory for wildlife conservation: If successful, India would have all the major big cats—tigers, lions, leopards, snow leopards and cheetahs—in its forests. Others, like environment lawyer Ritwick Dutta, call it a case of misplaced priorities. Funds and efforts, he says, could be much better spent on endangered species like the Bengal florican, wild buffalo, Asiatic lions and the Great Indian Bustard. —OK

Let women be in command

While arguing for the Union government on 5 February, during a Supreme Court hearing on a petition demanding permanent commissions for women in the Indian Army, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said “male soldiers in the Indian Army were not yet ready to accept women commanders"". The next day, after the apex court rebuked the government for its sexism, Mehta made things worse by saying: “In my opinion, women must not strive to be equal to men. They are in fact above men in all respects and better than men."" Spare us this patronizing tone, please. Women officers in the army have proved they are equal to the task, and it’s time that they are viewed that way. —SB

0,"As a deadly coronavirus spreads across China and ripples through other parts of the world, scientists are trying to pinpoint how humans first got exposed.

So far, they know the virus is zoonotic, meaning it jumps from animals to people. And genetic research has all but confirmed that it originated in bats. But scientists believe that another animal most likely served as the intermediary between bats and humans.

That animal could be the pangolin, a scaly, nocturnal mammal with a tongue longer than its body.

A group of researchers from South China Agricultural University found that samples from coronavirus patients were 99% identical to samples of the virus taken from wild pangolins, according to China's official Xinhua news agency. Their research hasn't been published or confirmed by other experts, but scientists say the results make sense, given what we know about the animals.

Pangolins are often poached for their keratin scales, which are used as ingredients in traditional Chinese medicine. Their meat is also considered a delicacy in China and Vietnam.

If bats drop feces or saliva onto food that's consumed by a pangolin, the animal can become a carrier of the coronavirus. Humans can then be exposed by consuming pangolins, allowing the virus to then be transmitted from person to person.

What we know about pangolins so far

Despite their forced interactions with humans, pangolins are mostly solitary in the wild. With the exception of one species, the long-tailed African pangolin, the animals spend most of the day sleeping in hollow trees or underground holes. At night, they hunt for insects such as ants and termites with their long, sticky tongues, which can stretch up to 16 inches.

Pangolins don't have teeth, but they rely on other features like their sharp claws to dig through insect mounds or strip away the bark from trees. They also have powerful tails that can support them when hanging upside down from branches.

Pangolins meet up once a year to mate, but mothers abandon their young after about two years. As the animals get older, their soft, white scales begin to harden and grow darker. Scientists believe pangolins are the only scaled mammal.

When a predator approaches, the animals can curl themselves into a ball and tuck their faces underneath their tail to protect themselves. But those defense mechanisms are no match against poachers.

Pangolins are illegally traded for their meat and scales

Though a pangolin resembles an anteater or armadillo on the outside, it's actually more closely related to an order of mammals called ""carnivorans,"" which include the bobcat and the civet. Civets were responsible for passing SARS from bats to people in 2002.

Both civets and pangolins are sold in Chinese wet markets, which put people in close contact with live and dead animals. It's not clear, though, whether pangolins were sold at the seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the new coronavirus most likely originated.

Multiple investigations have revealed that pangolins are still traded illegally, despite the practice being banned by the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species in 2016. In fact, they're often considered the world's most trafficked mammal — about 100,000 of them are plucked from the wild each year.

The China Biodiversity and Green Development Foundation, a Beijing-based nonprofit, found that more than 200 pharmaceutical companies still used pangolin products for about 60 commercially produced medicines.

All eight pangolin species are now threatened with extinction, and at least three species — including the Chinese pangolin — are listed as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

As a result, pangolin scales tend to fetch a high price: about $2,200 a pound in the US. But the animals still aren't widely recognized among the general population.

""That's one of the problems with species like pangolins,"" Annette Olsson, a technical adviser for Conservation International, told The New York Times in 2016. ""It's not huge and not very charismatic. It's small and weird and just disappearing.""

If pangolins do turn out to be the intermediary species for the new coronavirus, that could make it tough to determine how the animals passed the virus to humans.

""If the illegal animal trade was at the root of this outbreak, it is going to be really difficult to trace, and I suspect most of the evidence is gone already — destroyed or spread out across the black market,"" Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Texas A&M University, told The Washington Post. ""People aren't going to want to talk, because of the consequences.""",Everything we know about the pangolin — the scaly mammal that may have spread the coronavirus to humans,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPMNd4hj4ZJm8yRg8P_7Fb4qLQgEKiUIACIbd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc2FpKgQICjAMMJD-CQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.insider.com/5e40549cd9db1d29361ad954?width=1200&format=jpeg,2020-02-09,"{'sent': 'As a deadly coronavirus spreads across China and ripples through other parts of the world, scientists are trying to pinpoint how humans first got exposed.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China']}}",Pangolin
0,"For the first time ever, a baby Chinese pangolin was born in a captive environment at the Save Vietnam’s Wildlife (SVW) facility near Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam.

SVW released a video of the pangolin mother and her son this week leading up to World Pangolin Day on Feb. 15.

Chinese pangolins are listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List; pangolins are the world’s most trafficked animals, a trade driven by demand from East Asia for their flesh and scales.

The surprise baby is a huge win for SVW, indicating that its captive environment is suitable for its pangolins, rescued from traffickers, to have a healthy pregnancy, birth, and home to rear their young — all important steps for a successful breeding program.

For the first time ever, a baby Chinese pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) was born in a captive environment at the Save Vietnam’s Wildlife (SVW) facility in Cuc Phuong National Park, Vietnam.

The SVW team was surprised to notice the little scaly anteater strolling along behind his mother. The video, caught on camera in her enclosure, was released by SVW this week, leading up to World Pangolin Day on Feb. 15.

The mother pangolin was able to conceal her little secret for five months, SVW said, by spending her days deeply burrowed in the ground. She typically ventured out only after midnight, making it tough to observe her or her son’s behavior.

Capturing a photo of a pangolin in the wild has also proven challenging for SVW. Over the past five years, the organization has set up hundreds of camera traps in the forests of Vietnam and has yet to secure a single photo. This lack of data on ideal pangolin habitat creates a big challenge for SVW, which aims to one day release pangolins safely back into the wild.

Chinese pangolins are listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. They and the seven other pangolin species are the most trafficked animals on Earth, with their flesh and scales highly prized in East Asia. All eight species are subject to a global commercial trade ban under CITES.

Pangolin stories were among Mongabay’s most popular stories in 2019. And projects like the Pango-Cam, which offers a unique pangolin’s-eye-view of life, as well as rescue facilities like SVW, have brought much-needed attention to these charismatic creatures.

All of the Chinese pangolins at the SVW center were rescued from illegal trafficking, including the mother pangolin in the video, which was transferred to SVW by the police in Quang Nam province in March 2019.

Amid the wash of recent stories about pangolins’ potential connection to the coronavirus and the massive seizure of scales from more than 50,000 pangolins being illegally trafficked, the news of the pangolin birth in Vietnam brings some positivity to a troubling theme.

This surprise baby represents a huge win for SVW, demonstrating that its captive environment is suitable for pangolins to have a healthy pregnancy, birth, and home in which to rear their young — all important steps for a successful breeding program.

“This shocking but happy news of the mother giving birth, and successfully raising her child in our sanctuary is a prerequisite and an initial success for future breeding and rehabilitation projects for this species,” SVW communications officer Dung Nguyen Thi told Mongabay.

“We hope that seeing Chinese pangolins free and happy in the wild will, someday, not be a dream.”

0,"New Delhi: With about a million animal and plant species faced with extinction threats due to declining health of ecosystems as per the United Nations' landmark 2019 report on biodiversity, 130 countries will gather in Gujarat from Monday to discus enhanced protection of migratory animals at the 13th COP CMS (Conference of Parties to the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species).

The conference is an environment treaty under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the conference on Monday at Gandhinagar.

The triennial event will see India move key proposals seeking enhanced protection for the critically endangered Great Indian Bustard, Asian Elephant and Bengal Florican.

The procedure of the summit mandates that the country move a proposal for discussion and debate for the species to be included in Appendix I and II of the CMS, depending on the urgency of the protection.

Those that are threatened with extinction are included in Appendix I. Once a wild animal is included in Appendix I, countries that are part of the ranges of these wild animals have to push for greater habitat protection, prohibit their poaching and facilitate their movement.

The Great Indian Bustard, found only in the Indian subcontinent, is considered close to extinction as its population has dropped to 150 and largely concentrated in the Desert National Park in Rajasthan. A large terrestrial bird, the Bustard is facing a plethora of problems for survival ranging from dwindling habitat, hunting, low breeding, fatalities due to power lines and threats from other animals.

Radio-tagged Bustards have been found to moving to Cholistan desert in Pakistan where it faces similar threats.

The proposal to seek greater protection for Asian Elephants is important as the sub-species found in India migrates into Bangladesh and Nepal. According to India's proposal on the elephant, a population of 93 elephants move across the boundaries between India and Bangladesh.

“This for Bangladesh would represent nearly 25% of its population, but for India it would represent 0.2% of its population. Similarly, in Borneo the entire population in Kalimantan (Indonesia) is likely to be migratory across the border on a seasonal basis, but for Malaysia (Sabah) these elephants represent less than 3% of their population,” the proposal said.

The last elephant population estimation found 29,964 wild elephants in India.

Apart from these two animals, the conference will also see a discussion to enhance protection for Jaguars, the biggest wild cat found in South America, Oceanic White-Tip Shark, Smooth Hammerhead Shark, Antipodean Albatross and Little Bustard.

Light pollution, impact of aquatic pollution on marine mammals and ecological connectivity for migration of wildlife are some of the other key issues on the anvil at the conference.","Global Meet on Migratory Wildlife: India to Push for Higher Protection of Bustards, Jumbos Across Region",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPJq_ow9l5XMuAKc1lDwlCkqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow5qqNCzD4q58DMPbXpwY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2020/01/Wild-Elephants-2.jpg,2020-02-15,"{'sent': ""New Delhi: With about a million animal and plant species faced with extinction threats due to declining health of ecosystems as per the United Nations' landmark 2019 report on biodiversity, 130 countries will gather in Gujarat from Monday to discus enhanced protection of migratory animals at the 13th COP CMS (Conference of Parties to the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species).\n\n"", 'ents': {'GPE': ['New Delhi', 'Gujarat'], 'CARDINAL': ['about a million', '130'], 'ORG': [""the United Nations'""]}}",Chinese Crocodile Lizard

Loading Replay Replay video Play video Play video Some of the earliest infections were found in people who had exposure to Wuhan's seafood market, where bats, snakes, civets and other wildlife were sold. China temporarily shut down all such markets in January, warning that eating wild animals posed a threat to public health and safety. That may not be enough to change tastes or attitudes that are deeply rooted in the country's culture and history.

""In many people's eyes, animals are living for man, not sharing the earth with man,” said Wang Song, a retired researcher of zoology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Online debate The outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 1700 people in China, has revived a debate in the country about the use of wildlife for food and medicine. It previously came to prominence in 2003 during the spread of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which scientists believe was passed to humans from bats, via civets. Many academics, environmentalists and residents in China have joined international conservation groups in calling for a permanent ban on trade in wildlife and closure of the markets where wild animals are sold.

Online debate within China, most likely swayed by younger people, has heavily favoured a permanent ban. ""One bad habit is that we dare to eat anything,"" said one commenter called Sun on a news discussion forum on Chinese website Sina. ""We must stop eating wildlife and those who do should be sentenced to jail."" A Chinese pangolin rests on a tree branch at a wildlife rescue centre in Vietnam. Credit:AP Nevertheless, a minority of Chinese still like to eat wild animals in the belief it is healthy, providing the demand that sustains wildlife markets like that in Wuhan and a thriving online sales business, much of which is illegal. One online commenter calling themselves Onlooker Pharaoh said on Chinese news platform Hupu that the risk was worth it: ""Giving up wildlife to eat as food is like giving up eating because you might choke.""

Government support The breeding and trading of wild animals in China is supported by the government and is a source of profit for many people. A woman buys meat in a market in Hong Kong. Credit:Bloomberg After the SARS outbreak, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) strengthened oversight of the wildlife business, licensing the legal farming and sale of 54 wild animals including civets, turtles and crocodiles, and approved breeding of endangered species including bears, tigers and pangolins for environmental or conservation purposes. These officially sanctioned wildlife farming operations produce about $US20 billion ($29 billion) in annual revenue, according to a 2016 government-backed report.

Loading ""The state forestry bureau has long been the main force supporting wildlife use,"" said Peter Li, a China Policy Specialist for the Humane Society International. ""It insists on China's right to use wildlife resources for development purposes."" Much of the farming and sale of wildlife takes place in rural or poorer regions under the blessing of local authorities who see trading as a boost for the local economy. State-backed television programs regularly show people farming animals, including rats, for commercial sale and their own consumption. However, activists pushing for a ban describe the licensed farms as a cover for illegal wildlife trafficking, where animals are specifically bred to be consumed as food or medicine rather than released into the wild. ""They just use this premise to do illegal trading,"" Zhou Jinfeng, head of China’s Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, told Reuters. ""There are no real pangolin farms in China, they just use the permits to do illegal things.""

0,"Bengal floricans are a little known bustard species found in the grasslands of the Ganga and Brahmaputra river basin in India and Nepal. The species is being considered for protection under the upcoming 13th Conference of Parties of the Convention for Migratory Species (CMS), underway in Gandhinagar, Gujarat.

Scientists believe that Bengal floricans could act as flagship species for riverine grasslands in North and Northeast India, but the species is facing threats on several fronts

National and local conservation organisations are attempting to spread awareness and implement measures to protect the species from hunting and habitat loss, but funds and resources from the government are scarce.

On February 20, the CMS unanimously voted for accepting the proposal to include the Bengal Florican in the Appendix 1 of the CMS. Scientists believe efforts to protect the species will receive a boost in the form of increased attention and financial resources.

[This article has been updated after the CMS accepted the proposal about the Bengal Florican. Scroll to the end to read more.]

Starting late last week on the 15th of February, government officials, scientists and conservationists from 130 countries gathered at Gandhinagar, Gujarat for the 13th Conference of Parties (CoP) for the Convention for Migratory Species (CMS).

The CoP will review the state of migratory birds and animals around the world and will decide which birds and animals will need enhanced protection and collaboration between countries to ensure that they can move freely as they migrate between breeding grounds and wintering grounds.

Among the proposals that will be reviewed is one for the protection of an unusual species: the Bengal florican. Bengal floricans are a type of bustard that lives in dry riverine grasslands in India and Nepal in South Asia and Cambodia and Vietnam in Southeast Asia.

The way conservationists see it, bustards in India could be flagship species making the case for the protection of our grassland ecosystems. “Bengal Florican is a representative or an indicator species of dry grasslands in the Brahmaputra, as well as Ganga,” said Girish Jathar, a scientist and assistant director at Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS).

The presence of the species, according to Jathar, indicates a good healthy grassland ecosystem. Tragically, the grasslands that these birds depend on are disappearing, pushing them closer to extinction.

Yet, the Bengal florican has received very little attention compared to other bustards like the Great Indian Bustard, in part because very little is known about this species. But a recently renewed effort to the study the species and the threats it face,s coupled with the upcoming CMS proposal are making researchers hopeful for its future.

Read more: The great Indian bustard stands on the brink of extinction

Bengal floricans are large terrestrial birds (about 55 centimetres in height) that spend most of their time on the ground in dense grasslands, feeding on insects like grasshoppers and beetles, seeds, shoots of grass and frogs for food. In India, the species’ habitat lies in the floodplains of the country’s two largest rivers, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra.

In the Ganga floodplains, Bengal floricans are only known from the state of Uttar Pradesh, and in places like the Dudhwa and Pilibhit Tiger Reserve. In the Brahmaputra delta, the species is known from Jaldapara National Park in West Bengal, Kaziranga and Manas National Parks in Assam and the D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh.

These floricans also occur in several unprotected landscapes, such as islands in the Brahmaputra river and agricultural fields adjacent to protected grasslands both in Northeast India and UP. New research suggests that more populations, so far undetected, may exist in these landscapes.

Part of the reason for this uncertainty about populations, is that the species is simply quite difficult to study, explained Rohit Jha, a researcher from the Wildlife Institute of India. For most of the year, the birds are solitary and territorial in nature and easily stay hidden in the dense grasslands of these landscapes.

“It is extremely difficult to see the bird, thereby requiring many hours of patience and practice,” said Jha. It is only in the breeding season when the males of the species put up spectacular aerial displays to woo females, that the birds become somewhat visible.

The landscape adds to researchers’ difficulties according to Jha. Both Ganga and Brahmaputra are prone to flooding, inundating grasslands and making travel across rivers extremely risky, he explained.

New populations and old threats

Despite these difficulties, research advances have been made. Ornithologists like Asad Rahmani and the late Ravi Sankaran from BNHS studied Bengal floricans on and off for nearly 30 years starting in 1991, describing their behaviour, particularly breeding behaviour, habitats and threats. But surveys were restricted to a few known protected areas and typically only carried out in the breeding season when the males could be easily spotted courting females.

A study conducted from 2013 to 2016 added further information. Thirteen researchers from India, Nepal and the UK, including Jha and Rahmani, collaborated to study the species’ movement pattern and habitat use across its range in India and Nepal. Field surveys in Assam, Uttar Pradesh and adjoining Nepal in both protected and non-protected areas, revealed that Bengal floricans were essentially surviving in pockets of grasslands surrounded by agriculture, human habitation and tree plantations.

Using satellite data, the researchers also identified several potential habitats where Bengal floricans could be present, particularly in small riverine islands and grasslands outside protected areas in the Brahmaputra delta.

Some of these habitats are already revealing previously unknown populations, according to Jha. In a 2018 survey, researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India spotted four male Bengal floricans on two river islands in the Lohit river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra in Arunachal Pradesh.

“That sighting fell within the modelled distribution in our 2018 paper,” noted Jha.

Many of these sites, including the two islands in Lohit River are outside protected areas, creating several problems. Both Ganga and Brahmaputra delta are extremely fertile regions. Grasslands here are often converted into agricultural fields. While floricans can tolerate some level of cultivation, intensive farming, with heavy pesticide use can decimate insect populations the species depends on.

Jathar, who primarily works in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, also points out other threats like hunting add to the problem.

“Those birds that go outside the D’Ering Wildlife Sanctuary, they are likely to get hunted by the local people,” he said. “And if you go to another place like Amarpur [a seasonal island in Assam] which is not a PA, a good population is there, but there it’s grazing and burning of grass and that is the issue.”

Koklabari agricultural farms

However, not all non-protected areas are faring badly. Koklabari agricultural farms is a nine square kilometre farmland adjacent to the Manas Tiger Reserve. Formerly a seed research farm owned by the Central Government, Koklabari is now held by the Bodo Territorial Council and leased to local residents from nine villages for paddy cultivation.

Namita Brahma, a scientist formerly with the conservation NGO Aranyak, studied Bengal floricans in the landscape for her doctoral work. “This landscape is very important from the Bengal florican conservation point of view as it holds 8 Bengal florican territories and around 16 individuals in total,” she explained.

“The scientific study that I had carried out in Koklabari reveals that vegetation height is the prime importance for the species,” Brahma added. Like other bustards, Bengal Floricans prefer living in short grass where they can forage and nest easily, but need some tall grass surrounding their territory for cover and protection.

“I believe that the spots where the Bengal florican territories are present, there the vegetation height is being maintained due to paddy cultivation or agriculture activities,” she said.

Jathar speculates that people in Koklabari may also be more compassionate towards the species. “Though they [people] hunt other species, Bengal florican is not hunted that extensively. Otherwise, this bird wouldn’t have been there,” he said.

Bengal florican based bird tourism

Another factor protecting the species is a greater awareness of wildlife thanks to the presence of local conservation organisations and a niche but growing bird tourism industry. Until 2003, Manas and adjoining regions including Koklabari was in the midst of the Bodo agitation. At this point, Brahma notes that the entire management system of the Manas National Park had broken down. Poaching and logging was rampant.

When the agitation ended in 2003, local residents and the newly formed Bodo Territorial Council (BTC), which governs the region began to take an interest in reviving Manas. “Some of us felt it was important to protect the area,” said Rustom Basumatary, a bird guide from the Khamarbisha village near Koklabari.

Basumatary and a few others formed a local conservation organisation called the Manas Maozigendri Ecotourism Society. “We began to train former poachers into forest guards, rebuild abandoned anti-poaching camps and started awareness campaigns to talk about the ill effects of hunting and tree felling.” The BTC partially supports the salaries for the guards.

As tourists started trickling into the region, Basumatary took an interest in birdwatching and trained as a bird guide. The Maozigendri Society began to offer accommodation and services of bird guides to tourists. Today the area, particularly Koklabari, is a popular destination for bird tourists from around the world.

“Earlier we mainly had birders coming from foreign countries like Germany, UK, and Spain, but now Indian birders from Calcutta, Bombay, Bangalore and Guwahati have also started coming to watch birds,” Basumatary explained.

Several grassland birds attract birders, but Koklabari’s floricans are of course a huge draw. “Our people know Bengal Floricans well, but because of tourists showing interest [in watching the species] they are especially aware not to hunt it or disturb it,” he explained. “Sometimes people hunt other animals, but floricans are spared,” he added. Tourism also helps pay for the Society’s conservation activities, he pointed out.

Jathar believes that Koklabari’s tourism economy has lessons to offer to other florican landscapes such as D’Ering in Arunachal. “We’re trying to identify communities that are living close to the Bengal Florican habitat in Arunachal,” he said. “We are trying to see how we can facilitate the community to protect the Bengal Florican and how they can get revenue out of it.”

Attention from state governments

Not everybody believes that tourism is important. “The Bengal florican is a sensitive species, so we need not focus on mass bird tourism (good birdwatchers would like to see this species anyway), but we have to focus more on habitat management on a sound scientific basis,” said Rahmani.

The senior ornithologist bemoaned the lack of attention by state governments towards the species. “No state government has given any attention to the Bengal florican specifically – they are surviving in some protected areas as their habitat is protected for mega-vertebrates such as tiger, elephant, rhino, wild buffalo, swamp deer, hog deer,” he pointed out.

The local forest departments were, however, taking an interest in the species according to Jathar. “Active management is required, and we are working with the Arunachal Pradesh State Forest Department to do certain management interventions,” he said.

For instance, in D’Ering National Park in Arunachal, Jathar pointed out that invasive shrubs like Lantana camara and Chromolaena odorata are threatening to take over native short grass species that floricans love. “They [Arunachal Pradesh Forest Department] are taking a serious note of this,” said Jathar, adding that BNHS and the FD were planning to take steps for removing the invasive plants.

“But their main concern is the funds. So, we are requesting the State of Arunachal Pradesh [that] they should provide some extra funds to the D’Ering National Park to manage the species.”

Rahmani and Brahma also stressed the need for more studies to understand the specific nature of different threats. In areas like Koklabari, Brahma stressed the need to study the impacts of pesticides and fertilisers on the species, while Rahmani felt that more studies were needed on the impacts of hunting powerline collisions.

The senior ornithologist also underlined the importance of studying the movement of Bengal Floricans during non- breeding seasons. “We need to find out where do they go for almost six months and why do they go,” said Rahmani. Movement studies have indeed been crucial in making a case for protecting the species under the CMS.

CMS and the Bengal Florican

The 2013-2016 study that Jha and Rahmani were part of examined florican movements by attaching tracking devices on 11 individual floricans, four in India and seven in Nepal. The study revealed that in non-breeding seasons the birds moved out of the protected areas to agricultural fields and grasslands up to 80 kilometres away. Some of the individuals moved between Nepal and India during the non-breeding season, but always returned to the same breeding territories.

It was this movement across international borders, that led to the proposal to include the Bengal Florican in the CMS list of protected species. According to the definitions of the CMS, to be considered a migratory species the concerned animal must make regular seasonal movements across two or more national borders.

If the proposal is passed, researchers and conservationists hope that the species will increase in status with the Indian government and more funds will pour in for research and grassland management activities. But will the proposal muster enough support at the CoP?

Rahmani is confident that the proposal will be accepted as the species clearly moves across national borders. Jathar is cautiously optimistic. “We think that it is also present in part of Bhutan, which is adjacent to Manas. That is why we’re pushing for this. Maybe something good will happen for this species at the coming CMS,” he said.

CMS accepts proposal on Bengal Florican

On February 20, the 13th Conference of Parties at the Convention for Migratory Species (CMS) has unanimously accepted the Indian government’s proposal to include the Bengal Florican in the Appendix 1 of the CMS. The Indian delegation urged the member states to accept the proposal based on recent information that Bengal Floricans moved between the India, Nepal and Bhutan during the non- breeding season.

Girish Jathar, from Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS), one of several people involved in helping the Indian government prepare the proposal expressed happiness. “It will be extremely beneficial for the Bengal Florican and increase collaboration with Nepal and Bhutan,” he said. Jathar also believes that the move would help conservationists and managers raise more funds, from the Government of India as well as other international bodies, for studying and managing the Bengal Florican.

The COP also accepted the proposal to include the Great Indian Bustard in CMS Appendix 1.

0,"New Delhi: Animal culture, the learning of non-human species through socially transmitted behaviours, is being linked to conservation action for the first time.

There is evidence that whales, dolphins, elephants and primates acquire some of their knowledge and skills through social learning. In addition to individual learning, some animals may learn socially from adults or peers about various behaviours, including optimal migration routes.

To consider conservation measures for the Eastern tropical Pacific sperm whale and the nut-cracking chimpanzee, two such proposals will be presented to delegates at the ongoing 13th Conference of Parties meeting to the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS COP13), in Gandhinagar.

The concerted action for the sperm whale recognizes the complex social structure within four subspecies. They differ little from each other in their nuclear DNA, but their vocalizations vary considerably, indicating that these can only be acquired through social interaction and learning. Collecting data through acoustic and photographic records can help conservationists fully understand the social structure of all subspecies. The proposed conservation measures call for research and transboundary information exchange to close knowledge gaps.

The initiative for the nut-cracking chimpanzees highlights the species’ unique technological culture. The species can crack open different types of nuts by using stones and pieces of wood as a hammer and anvil. Despite nuts, stones and wood being commonly available, nut-cracking skills occur only in the most westerly parts of this subspecies’ range spanning Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire, and not in other populations across Africa. Scientists say this cultural capacity enables these chimpanzees to survive dry seasons in their western habitats. Such behaviour could enhance the survival prospects of chimpanzees in areas showing climate-induced changes to vegetation.

Human activities that disrupt the social fabric of culturally developed species can have severe impacts. Once a species has vanished from an area, critical knowledge can be also be lost. For instance, the Southern Right Whales’ knowledge of migration routes around New Zealand’s coastline was lost to the species as a result of commercial whaling in the 1800s. Nowadays, a handful of whales have again started to calve around New Zealand.

Recent evidence of genetic mixing among these whales suggests that the species may recolonize forgotten migration destinations once the population recovers from the impact of whaling.

Protecting cultural knowledge among peers and across generations may be vital for the survival and successful reproduction of certain species. Supporting individuals that act as ‘repositories’ of social knowledge such as elephant matriarchs or groups of knowledgeable elders, might be just as important as conserving critical habitat.

Understanding how sperm whales pass on valuable information to their offspring or why some groups of chimpanzees have a culture of cracking nutritious nuts with stone tools while others do not, can be key to evaluating conservation challenges for such species.

The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) has been spearheading efforts to use scientific knowledge on animal culture, to better protect endangered wildlife. Scientific research has made significant progress in animal culture. However, it is necessary to develop findings and recommendations that show how this complex issue can be further considered in conservation efforts under CMS.

0,"Weibo was recently awash with the bitter emoji tears of frog meat-eaters declaring disappointment that their favorite amphibious meal had been taken off the menu in China. These netizens were responding to an image that had been circulating online, supposedly originating from the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, that claimed that bullfrog, along with several other types of sea creatures and poultry, had been banned from trade.

As it turns out, there is, in fact, a list of newly protected animals in the works. However, the list is as of yet unreleased, and no one knows for sure whether frogs or any other type of prized 'wildlife' meat will be on the list.

What led us to this moment?

Amid the coronavirus panic, public opinion on anything and everything that could remotely relate to disease control has shifted. One such matter is wildlife conservation, as the virus might have been hosted by endangered species such as the Chinese pangolin (or a civet or a bat, the jury's still out), which received new protections in China last year.

As loose as this connection is, it has led to skyrocketing public favor of increased control, and 97 percent of Chinese are now saying they are against eating wildlife animals. China’s lawmakers seized on this opportunity to finally push through much-needed changes in wildlife protection laws and brought in experts from all over the country as well as Australia and the United States to form an advisory task force.

How China's frog breeders reacted

Apparently sensing that their industry was about to be tongued down and swallowed like a fly, the nation’s bullfrog breeders responded. The Special Committee for Frog Cultivation, which was created by the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA), issued a (since deleted) statement titled ""Wildlife Cultivation is One of the Great Pioneering Achievements of Our Human Ancestors."" The statement, perhaps unwisely, criticized the banning of wildlife trade in response to a single outbreak as ""unscientific and unreasonable.""

Unpleased with the special committee having stirred the pot in which the frogs were about to boil, the CWCA then released an apology statement that said the committee’s statement had had a negative influence on society. The apology, was in a sense a kiss – but far from turning the special committee into a prince, it was the kiss of death. The committee was abolished.

So, bullfrogs are safe, but for how long?

Seeing the news that the Special Committee for Frog Cultivation had been croaked, netizens leaped a lily pad too far, concluding that this meant that frog cultivation and trade would be banned. This was false, but it was enough to get the rumor mill going.

What is true, however, is that the aforementioned research task force has recommended, among other measures, extending the scope of China’s wildlife protection law based on international conventions and practices. However, no list of species has been made public.

But is there any reason that bullfrog trade might be restricted after all? We don’t know why only the Special Committee on Frog Cultivation got so wound up about potential policy changes, but we do know that bullfrogs are not an endangered species. Quite the opposite: they are an invasive species, and if the frog breeding industry ever does get the smackdown, it will likely be because it is a threat to other amphibious wildlife.

0,"They lived on the Earth about 166-168 million years ago, in the Middle Jurassic.

The paleontologists found the remains of the ancient amphibian at the Berezovsky quarry, a fossil locality in the Krasnoyarsk Krai near the town of Sharypovo. Fossils of ancient fish, various reptiles, mammals, herbivorous and predatory dinosaurs have been previously found there. The research materials were collected on field expeditions in the mid-2010s. In these expeditions the scientists from St Petersburg University worked alongside experts from the University of Bonn (Germany), the Tomsk State University, the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Sharypovo Museum of Local History and Nature.

Four vertebrate fossils enabled the scientists to declare the finding of a new genus and species. These were: three trunk vertebrae and the atlas — the first and, in the case of the salamander, the only cervical vertebra. Since the atlas is a highly specialized vertebra, providing for attachment and rotation movements of the skull, it has a rather complex structure, the scientists explain. It is therefore most suitable for describing a new species as it provides much information for analysis. The amphibian proved to have belonged to the geologically oldest stem salamanders.

It was not the first time that remains of ancient salamanders had been found at the Berezovsky quarry. One of them — a basal stem salamander Urupia monstrosa, named after the nearby Uryup River — was about 50-60 centimeters long. Another one — Kiyatriton krasnolutskii — was named after a local historian Sergei Krasnolutskii, the discoverer of the fossil locality Berezovsky quarry. By contrast, this one was quite small in size (about 10-15 centimeters) and looked more like modern Hynobiidae. The newly discovered salamander, judging by the size of the vertebrae, was of medium length (about 20 centimeters).

‘Salamanders first appear in the fossil records in the Middle Jurassic, including representatives of both the present-day salamander families and the most primitive ones,’ said Pavel Skutschas, associate professor of St Petersburg University, doctor of biology, expert in Mesozoic vertebrates. ‘When they had just appeared, salamanders made efforts to occupy different ecological niches. Thus, the stem salamanders filled the niche of large water bodies; while those close to the present-day salamanders found their niche in small water bodies. As for the newly discovered salamander, it occupied a middle position, although morphologically, it is closer to the primitive.’

The scientists not only described the external characteristics of the specimens, but were able to look inside the fossils. In this, they were assisted by the experts from the ‘Centre of X-ray diffraction studies’ at the Research Park of St Petersburg University, where the specimens were scanned on up-to-date microtomography scanners. Based on the obtained data, the paleontologists created 3D reconstructions of the vertebrae and described their internal structure. As expected, it proved to be very similar to that of the large stem salamanders.

The ancient amphibian received the name Egoria malashichevi — in honor of Yegor Malashichev, associate professor of the Department of Vertebrate Zoology at St Petersburg University, who, among other things, studied the morphology of caudate amphibians. ‘Yegor Malashichev was a wonderful person and a very talented scientist. He supported aspiring palaeontologists and did everything to help them to stay in scientific research,’ remarked Pavel Skutschas. Additionally, Malashichev studied the phenomenon of lateralization (body asymmetries associated with the functioning of the nervous system), as well as other asymmetries in motor performance and visual perception. Yegor Malashichev’s professional career was almost exclusively connected with St Petersburg University. In 1996, he graduated from the Faculty of Biology and Soil Science. In 2000, he began to teach there, and in 2003, he defended his dissertation and was awarded a PhD in biology. Sadly, in late 2018, he passed away unexpectedly.

The next step for the paleontologists is to compare the bones of the ‘Berezovsky’ salamanders with the fossils from Great Britain: the ‘Kirtlington’ salamanders which were found at the Kirtlington quarry in Oxfordshire. The Siberian and British faunas of the mid-Jurassic time were very similar. Besides, the paleontologists are aware of similar amphibians that lived in the territory of present-day England. ‘They may be representatives of the same genera. However, to ascertain this, a detailed comparison of the palaeontological collections is required. In the coming spring, our colleagues from England will come to St Petersburg to study our research materials. We may discover that Urupia and Egoria used to have a very wide habitat, extending across Europe and Asia,’ mused Pavel Skutschas.

Even as India moved proposals to include the great Indian bustard, Asiatic elephants and Bengal florican in the Appendix-I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) at the ongoing 13th Conference of Parties (COP13) to the CMS, experts expressed concerns about safety of their habitats within the country due to power transmission lines and roads. They stressed that efforts to mitigate climate change can result in pressures on wildlife if energy project siting is not done carefully.

Addressing a workshop on the sidelines of the COP13 at the Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar, Yadvendradev Jhala, dean of Wildlife Institute of India, said India needed to make habitats of tigers, elephants and GIB safe for these species. “We need to create safe habitats. Habitats are there but habitats are not safe due to powerlines,” said Jhala while speaking on Indian initiatives for conservation of tigers and GIBs.

Jhala said that while tiger population was recovering in the country, India needed to now focus on habitat connectivity which is threatened by development of roads and railways. He said that such projects should be permeable for wildlife. He also said that power lines in grasslands of Kutch district of Gujarat and Rajasthan, the main habitat of the critically endangered GIB were a major threat to these birds. “Five to 15 (GIB) birds die annually from power line collisions. Our research in Thar has shown that we lose about 1,00,000 birds in the Desert National Park area of 4,000 square kilometres (in Rajasthan). This is phenomenal, all birds, not just bustards. We need to stem this mortality by taking power lines underground,” said the researcher.

The scientist added that there were less than 1,000 GIBs in 1970s but this has come down to around 150. “Major problem here is power line collision, historical hunting and introduction of exotic predators which remove chicks and nests in plane areas where these birds breed,” he said, adding desert areas which form part of the GIB has high-density of dog population – 10 dogs per 100 sqkm.

GIBs are very slow breeders, Jhala said and warned that unnatural death of even a single adult bird can mean very huge loss for the species. He said that forest department has taken up in-situ conservation measures like setting up structures which make nests inaccessible to predators. “But because all these in-situ measures will take time and we may not have time for the bustards, we have started a conservation breeding programme in collaboration with Rajasthan forest department and the International Fund for Houbara Conservation,” said Jhala adding as part of the project, nine GIB eggs were harvested from the wild, their hatching has remained successful and that chicks have grown into juveniles.

WII is the premier wildlife research institute run by the Indian government.

Jhala said that they have identified important bird movement corridors. “Bird diverters is one way to address power line collisions. We satellite-tagged many of these birds in Desert National Park and mapped their movements to determine their exact paths and the power lines which are barriers in their movement. This has helped us in limiting the investments of understanding these power lines should be done,” he said while also noting that the Supreme Court had recently ordered taking power lines underground.

He said that status of lesser florican, another bustard species occurring in the country was also a major concern “We estimate the population to be around 1000 individuals only. So, we do not want to wait till these birds become 100. We would like to start breeding programmes for them,” said Jhala adding “the future of bustards in India – we may save them from becoming extinct but if we may ever be able to repopulate in our lost landscape of bustards would depend on the people of India and how much we compromise our developmental agenda with what is required by these bird.”

Speaking at another event organised by the Energy Task Force of the CMS, Ruby Ojha, environmental and social development specialist with the International Finance Corporation, said that solar and wind power plants of cumulative 5,000 MW capacity were at various stages of development in Kutch district.

Ramesh Selvaraj, a scientist with the Bombay Natural History Society, an Indian NGO working for conservation of wild animals said that their study in Samakhiyali area of Kutch, where a large number of wind turbines have been installed, recorded 47 cases of deaths of birds after hitting the turbines over a period of three years.

Meanwhile, international experts suggested that core habitats must be avoided for energy projects. “Due to climate change, there has been focus on renewable energy. However, we now know that infrastructure associated with production and distribution of renewal energy may pose great risks to species, ecosystems and migratory species in particular,” said Josef Tumbrinck, deputy director general of directorate of Nature Conservation of Germany.

The 13th Conference of Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP13) concluded here with listing of total 10 migratory species of the world on Appendix I & II of the convention along with adoption of a number of resolutions and decisions to address the needs and threats facing migratory species around the globe. Three of the species listed are from India – great Indian bustard, mainland Asian elephant and Bengal florican.

The other seven species which got listed on the appendices of the CMS include jaguar, little bustard, antipodean albatross, oceanic white-tip shark, urial, smooth hammerhead shark and the tope shark. The Convention also agreed upon concerted and targeted conservation plans for 14 other species.

India hosted the CMS COP for the first time and with that, also formally assumed the role of CMS Presidency for the next three years. The theme of the COP13 was, “Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home!”

In the closing press conference of COP13, India expressed a strong resolve to recover the population of GIB which is on the brink of extinction with only around 150 birds left in the country.

The other range country of this critically endangered bird and a party to the CMS, Pakistan, remained absent from the event. Alleged hunting of GIB in Pakistan is believed to be one of the reasons for the plummeting numbers of the bird species.

Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Babul Supriyo said, “GIB is one bird which is facing very severe threat of extinction. And we are worried about the killing and poaching on the other side of the border, Pakistan. As you know that the GIB has been included in Appendix I, so all the parties who are party of CMS are obligated and it is mandatory for them to follow the rules and regulations…We all work together to ensure that all the countries, including Pakistan, do the necessary to save GIB.”

Inspector General of Forests (wildlife), Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change Soumitra Dasgupta said, “GIB is a big question, internationally. And specially for India…So, India would do anything for conservation of this species…”

Mentioning the Indian government’s efforts for conservation of GIB, Dasgupta said, “There are scientific reports that the birds do fly to Pakistan. So, we need to ensure that the species receives equal protection, that we are providing in India, in the neighbouring country to which the GIB flies; so that the bird’s number starts increasing and one day we can say that the GIB is out of endangerment.”

Total 130 countries of the world are party to the Convention and the COP13 held at Gandhinagar was the largest ever.

“CMS COP13 was the largest ever in the history of the Convention, with 2,550 people attending including 263 delegates representing 82 Parties, 11 delegates from 5 non-Party countries, 50 representatives from the United Nations agencies, 70 representatives of international NGOs, 127 representatives of national NGOs and over 100 members of both national and international media,” said a release from the CMS secretariat.

As per CMS, despite the listing and consequent efforts, 73% of 175 migratory species listed on Appendix-I and 48% of the 518 on Appendix-II have an overall decreasing population trend.

In an apparent reference to this, the release quoted Executive Secretary of CMS Amy Fraenkel as saying, “The initial status report has been a real wake up call for the Convention, and Parties recognised, the importance of a more thorough analysis. CMS COP13 has given a clear mandate to prepare a flagship report on the status of migratory species which will give us a better idea of what is happening on the ground, and also provide a much needed tool for understanding where we need to focus our work.”

The COP13 witnessed a number of proposals and resolutions passed following debate over the same by party countries.

Among issues that divided countries at the COP13 was a proposal moved by the CMS secretariat to put additional restrictions on countries whose financial contributions are three or more year in arrears.

The secretariat proposed to deny parties in arrears the right to submit reports and proposals for listing of species on CMS Indices. However, Brazil led the opposition to this proposal successfully, convincing the European Union and other countries like Israel, Australia, New Zealand etc. to withdraw their support to the proposal.

“In the negotiations, we said that we are not against restrictions per say. But the denial of rights to submit proposals for listing of species on CMS Indices would punish the species that require attention rather than the countries which are in arrears. For example, if Brazil is in arrears, you may like to punish the country. But if the hammerhead shark requires attention of the CMS and listing on Indices and if Brazil is denied to submit proposal, it will be a punishment to the species. Therefore, we said that the proposal of additional restrictions goes against the core mandate of the CMS. Had that proposal gone through, 20 per cent of the Parties would have lost rights,” Igor Vidal, an officer of the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and a delegate at the COP13 told The Indian Express.

Similarly, African countries also persuaded other Parties to not adopt another proposal of the CMS secretariat to introduce a framework of mandatory minimum financial contributions from Parties, stating that this would lead to huge increase in financial liabilities of countries whose economies are not very strong.

CMC rules mandate that the inter-sessional budget be approved unanimously and there is no provision to put it to vote.

The COP13 also approved budget for inter-sessional period 2020-2023, with a 4.5 per cent increase in the core budget of the Convention. The budget also approved creation of post of an associate programme officer for avian species.

0,"What is the Chinese crocodile lizard?

This colorful reptile is not a crocodile but a lizard. It gets its name from its powerful tail, which is scaly like that of a crocodile. The Chinese crocodile lizard’s defining feature is its vibrant skin. It has a gray-brown body with a yellow-tan underside and red or orange scales running along its sides. Males are usually larger and more colorful, with the colors growing more vivid during breeding season.

Otherwise known as the shinisaurus, the Chinese crocodile lizard is a popular household pet. It hails from a small mountain range in southern China and northern Vietnam.

Habitat

These territorial and semiaquatic creatures spend their time alone in slow-moving streams and freshwater pools. Picture a densely populated subtropical forest in the mountains of southern China: It is in the watery bottom of this biome that crocodile lizards like to swim. The vegetation and rocky crags provide shelter and protection, which these otherwise solitary reptiles usually share when they go into brumation—similar to hiberation—for the winter.

Diet and behavior

These reptiles hunt in the water as well. Their primary source of food is invertebrates, like insects, snails, and tadpoles. In captivity, they are also fed bugs like crickets and worms.

What sets Chinese crocodile lizards apart is that the young are precocial, which means that they are capable of feeding and caring for themselves from the moment they are born. Their parents do not raise them.

When they encounter a predator, Chinese crocodile lizards tend to choose flight over fight: They hiss, bite, and defecate until they can escape into the water and propel themselves away with their tail.

Threats to survival

Chinese crocodile lizards are the last surviving species of their genus and family, the Shinisauridae, which dates back more than 100 million years. They are now under threat mainly because of human activity, and are listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species.

Loss of habitat from deforestation is the primary reason the population of Chinese crocodile lizards is declining. In Vietnam, for example, the area where a subspecies was discovered in 2003 is now in danger from activities like logging and coal mining. Thomas Ziegler, the German scientist who first recorded this subspecies, estimates that there are only 200 left.

In southern China, electro-fishing—a method using electricity to stun the catch—and fish poisoning affect younger crocodile lizards, who may be directly killed by these practices.

Harvesting is another threat: Crocodile lizards make docile and pretty pets, which is why so many of them are illegally taken from the wild for the international exotic pet trade.



Conservation

About half of the areas where crocodile lizards are known to live are protected.

Researchers are constantly working to improve these existing protections. Ziegler’s joint German-Vietnamese team has established breeding programs in both Hanoi, Vietnam, and Cologne, Germany.",Chinese crocodile lizard,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vYW5pbWFscy9yZXB0aWxlcy9jL2NoaW5lc2UtY3JvY29kaWxlLWxpemFyZC_SAWZodHRwczovL2FwaS5uYXRpb25hbGdlb2dyYXBoaWMuY29tL2Rpc3RyaWJ1dGlvbi9wdWJsaWMvYW1wL2FuaW1hbHMvcmVwdGlsZXMvYy9jaGluZXNlLWNyb2NvZGlsZS1saXphcmQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/animals/thumbs/rights-exempt/reptiles/c/chinese-crocodile-lizard-thumbnail-nationalgeographic_1098063.ngsversion.1583443996684.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2020-02-25,"{'sent': 'It hails from a small mountain range in southern China and northern Vietnam.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['China', 'Vietnam']}}",Chinese Crocodile Lizard
0,"The role played by humans in the extinction of close to 500 animal species since 1900s is often underplayed. Whether it is the destruction of their habitat through deforestation or hunting them into oblivion for their fur and tusks, humans always find new ways of inflicting damage to the ecosystem without any regard to the impact of their actions. Another unfortunate practice that has been driving animals towards their total wipeout is hunting for food. Humans have been hunting for ages, purposely for sustenance. But it has now reached a point where some animal species are being eaten out of existence. Here are the ten animals that the world is eating into extinction.

Pangolins

Pangolins are the world's most trafficked animals, and more than a million of them are believed to have been killed for food in the last 20 years alone. A delicacy in Asian countries like China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, pangolins are also hunted for their fresh blood and scales. There is an unfounded belief in most of the Asian nations that ground pangolin scales cure asthma and cancer, a misconception that has driven up their hunt. Of the eight pangolin species in the wild, four are listed as Vulnerable, two are listed as Endangered, and another two have been declared Critically Endangered.

Red River Turtle

Locally known as the Yangtze giant softshell turtle. The animal was once found in all the major rivers passing through Vietnam and most of China. Only four living individuals are left, and the hopes of saving the turtle are getting dimmer and dimmer every day. The red river turtle has been hunted for its meat and eggs. Their bones are also on high demand and are used in medicine. Their skulls are kept as trophies by their hunters. Of the four individuals left, only one is a female, and efforts to breed them in captivity have not yet been successful.

Red Colobus

Red colobus monkeys are mostly in Eastern and Central Africa. It is a monkey that has had the misfortune of being hunted by both humans and chimpanzees. Chimpanzees live off fruits, insects, and vegetation, but when an opportunity to eat meat appears, it usually involves the hunting of red colobus monkeys. Humans have hunted the red colobus for their meat and beautiful coats.

Bluefin Tuna

Bluefin tuna is one of the fastest fish species in the ocean with speeds that can hit 40mph. They can grow up to 14 feet long and weigh around 1,800 pounds, making them the perfect fish for the perfect meal. High demand for sushi and sashimi has pushed bluefin tuna populations to the brink of extinction with their status switching between Vulnerable and Critically Endangered from time to time. Lack of International laws to protect the bluefin tuna and the fact that they take too long to grow in fish farms has led to overfishing. Soon the Atlantic Ocean will no longer have them.

Chinese Giant Salamander

With a length of almost six feet and a weight of approximately 140 pounds, the Chinese giant salamander is the largest amphibian on the planet. Unfortunately, the salamander is a considerable delicacy in China, and this has pushed their numbers to the limit. The large amphibian is now listed as Critically Endangered. There are nearly 50,000 individuals left in the wild and about 2.6 million in different breeding farms run by big restaurants. The downside to keeping the salamanders in restricted spaces is that diseases are spreading faster and are passed on to the populations in the wild, further endangering them.

Sturgeons

Sturgeons have been around for over 200 million years, and they have survived countless mass extinction events only for them to be driven to the brink of a total wipeout by humans. Sturgeons are aggressively hunted for their eggs, which make caviar, one of the most expensive dishes in the world that usually fetch an impressive $4,500 per pound. The caviar rush of the 1800s almost pushed sturgeons to extinction until intervention saved them. They have steadily raised their numbers but are still being hunted for their meat and eggs.

Eastern Lowland Gorilla

It is a cousin of the mountain gorilla. The eastern lowland gorilla is being hunted in the Democratic Republic of Congo for its meat. With no other predator, the gorilla was once spread out across the Central African jungles but has seen its population reduced by about 77% in a single generation. There are roughly 3,800 individuals left in the wild. Consumption of bushmeat in DRC is considered a wealthy indulgence. The demand has encouraged poaching. Similarly, instability in the region has hampered conservation efforts.

Sharks

The indiscriminate killing of sharks to obtain their fins before tossing the rest of their carcass back into the water has to be the most despicable human acts against nature. The practice of eating shark fin soup dates back to the Ming Dynasty in the 1300s, where it was viewed as a symbol of status and power. The worst-hit is the shortfin Mako shark. Driving this hunt for sharks is China, where shark fin soup is seen as an elite dish for the wealthy with a bowl going for more than $100. More than 73 million sharks are killed annually just for their fins.

Green Sea Turtles

Even before humans started hunting them in large numbers for their meat, shells, and eggs, green sea turtles were already grappling with pollution, being caught in fishing nets meant for others and habitat loss. They have been hunted for the illegal trade, particularly in Asia, where their body parts fetch high prices, and their meat and eggs are a coveted delicacy. Their shells are believed to have medicinal powers in some African cultures. Although they were accorded protection in 1977, they are still being hunted in large numbers in Africa and South Asia.

Muskox

The muskox weighs over 900 pounds, and at one time they were widespread in North America and Siberia, and together with the bison, provided food for the Native Americans. However, the situation changed with the arrival of Europeans who had deadlier hunting weapons. Between 1900 and 1930, the muskox was almost driven to extinction by excessive hunting for their meat and hides. There are 80,000 muskoxen left in the wild now.

Others

Other animals that are barely holding on to their existence in the face of hunting include the Great white shark, the largest predatory fish on earth, which is facing a threat called finning. The flying fox is the largest bat species on earth with a wingspan of up to 6 feet, and is being hunted for its meat and sport. The Whale shark, the largest fish in the ocean, has been on the Critically Endangered list for about three years now because of excessive hunting. They are hunted for their meat, fins, and other body parts used for medicinal purposes. The Indri, a Madagascan lemur, is currently facing wipeout thanks to the increase in poaching, which is driven by starvation in the country. The European eel is being overfished in the oceans and has seen their stocks dwindle by half in the last 50 years.

Critical Statistics

The human culinary habits are a direct threat to the survival of a staggering 301 land mammals. Of these, primate species facing extinction as a result of our eating habits are 168 primates, 26 species of marsupials, 21 species of rodents, and 73 species of hoofed animals. Bushmeat is so vital in Congo that it accounts for almost 80% of the protein intake in the region. It is estimated that over 6 million tons of bushmeat are sourced from the Congo Basin despite the international ban on their trade. The Red List now has an estimated 1,414 species of fish listed as endangered because of overfishing.

According to the World-Wide Fund for Nature, the modern-day human eats 42 pounds of fish on average in a year, which is two times more than what he consumed 50 years ago. As things stand at the moment, over 60% of fish stocks in all the five oceans have been fully exploited. Another 30% is already over-exploited. Fish numbers will not be able to hold on for long, and if this continues, oceans will be empty in the next 50 years.

What Can Be Done?

Harsh penalties need to be devised to deal with the illegal poaching and trafficking of endangered animals. Humans need to find other sources of nutrition so that they can allow the depleted numbers of animals in the wild to be restored. Fishing regulations need to become tighter and stricter to protect fish populations in the ocean. New ways of enforcing bans on practices like finning need to be implemented to stamp them out permanently. Communities living near the endangered species have to be sensitized on the impact of their actions and what could happen if they continue hunting the animals. Poverty is one of the many reasons that push people into poaching. Once they are aware and empowered with new sources of income, then the animals can be spared.",10 Animals That The World Is Eating Into Extinction,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkYXRsYXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwLWFuaW1hbHMtdGhhdC10aGUtd29ybGQtaXMtZWF0aW5nLWludG8tZXh0aW5jdGlvbi5odG1s0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud29ybGRhdGxhcy5jb20vYW1wL2FydGljbGVzLzEwLWFuaW1hbHMtdGhhdC10aGUtd29ybGQtaXMtZWF0aW5nLWludG8tZXh0aW5jdGlvbi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.worldatlas.com/r/w1200-h701-c1200x701/upload/0d/7e/76/1280px-maxim-s-hku-wildaid-protest-11.jpg,2020-02-26,"{'sent': 'The role played by humans in the extinction of close to 500 animal species since 1900s is often underplayed.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['close to 500']}}",Pangolin
0,"On Feb. 24, China announced it would implement a “comprehensive” and immediate ban on the trade and consumption of wild animals nationwide. The move cemented an earlier emergency ban enacted amid the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, which has killed 2,800 and sickened over 80,000 worldwide as of Feb. 27.

But whether it will have a lasting impact is another question. This isn’t the first time a zoonotic coronavirus has devastated China or sparked a legislative and popular backlash against wild animal consumption. SARS, which some scientists believe jumped to humans from masked palm civets at a wet market in southern China, killed nearly 800 people around the world from 2002 to 2004. While recent research has cast doubt on the theory that COVID-19 originated in a live animal market in the central city of Wuhan, virologists still believe it was likely transmitted to humans from wild animals, possibly endangered pangolins.

In the wake of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, China updated its existing rules governing the wildlife trade, but a combination of loopholes and muddled enforcement has continued to render them largely ineffective. If we want this time to be different, we first need to understand the cultural and commercial drivers of the trade, as well as the flaws in the current regulatory and enforcement system.

Chinese have consumed wild animals for thousands of years, though contrary to stereotypes abroad, they are hardly a fixture of the country’s dinner tables. In its most basic form, the practice was a matter of survival: China had a large population, limited arable land, and a long history of natural and man-made disasters. In times of need, many ordinary Chinese turned to wild animals and plants for sustenance.

In non-emergencies, the traditional notion that “like nourishes like” led many to believe that eating animal parts could have a beneficial effect on the diner’s corresponding body part. For example, braised beef tendon was seen as a curative for frail knees, and sheep’s penis as a virility booster.

As the above examples show, such customs aren’t necessarily tied to the consumption of wild or exotic animals. But there is a long-standing belief in China that the rarer something is, the greater its value. Rare or hard-to-obtain meat was — and sometimes still is — thought to have extremely potent medicinal effects. It could also be a powerful symbol of filial piety, love, and respect, as in the folk story of the woman who cut flesh from her thigh to cook a medicinal porridge for her mother-in-law.

One domestic media outlet found over 100 possible exceptions to the new rules, including sika deer, red deer, and ring-necked pheasant. - Zhou Hongcheng, professor

These customs have been reinforced by the tenets of traditional Chinese medicine, which makes liberal usage of ingredients extracted from wild animals — such as tiger bone, pilose antler, and deer fetus. Pangolins are another common source of curatives. And while the consumption of pangolin meat is illegal in the country, an exception for TCM practitioners has long allowed the scales of farm-bred pangolins to be prescribed for medicinal use — a loophole that has greatly complicated efforts to protect the species.

China has had a wildlife protection law on the books since 1988, but its single-minded focus on encouraging the commercial rearing and breeding of species over conservation has led many critics to dub it the “wildlife exploitation law.” In particular, species categorized as one of the “three haves” — having “ecological, scientific, or social value,” like pangolins — were eligible to be bred and sold by licensed farms, which have become a key pillar of rural economies in impoverished parts of the country.

In addition to forming a regulatory blind spot — the relevant authorities generally lack the resources to ensure wildlife farms are operating legally and within regulations — farm-raised wildlife muddies the waters for what is and isn’t legal to consume. The latest ban, despite its claim to be “comprehensive,” does little to clear things up. One domestic media outlet found over 100 possible exceptions to the new rules, including sika deer, red deer, and ring-necked pheasant.

It doesn’t have to be this way. On Feb. 25, the day after China announced its nationwide ban on the wild animal trade, the southern megacity of Shenzhen unveiled its own version of the rules, including a white list with just nine types of meat on it. On the city’s black list were a number of species, including turtles, snakes, and some types of birds that local authorities believed posed a risk to public health, despite still being legal to raise under national law.

That’s a far simpler and more effective approach than the convoluted new national ban, but it may not be enough on its own. One of the primary reasons China is so vulnerable to zoonotic diseases is the very nature of its cities — and the places where animals, both wild and domesticated, are sold.

Wet markets have been linked to numerous infectious disease outbreaks in China over the years, from SARS to bird flu, and their close proximity to residential areas makes them a sizeable community risk. COVID-19 might not have originated in a Wuhan wet market, but the market’s central location almost certainly helped accelerate its spread.

Wet markets’ reputations as incubators for disease makes them easy targets during epidemics, and local governments around the country have responded to the current crisis with bans and cleanup campaigns. The eastern province of Zhejiang, for example, has not just cracked down on the wild animal trade, but also the sale of live poultry.

These campaign-style enforcement efforts cannot achieve lasting change. As long as small markets are allowed to sell and slaughter live animals, resource-strapped local governments will be hard-pressed to monitor and regulate their compliance with health and sanitation codes. To reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission, slaughter and packaging operations should be moved to large-scale, advanced, and easier-to-monitor operations away from residential areas.

The guiding principles of any legislation should be clarity and practicability - Zhou Hongcheng, professor

Ultimately, the guiding principles of any legislation should be clarity and practicability. Banning the wildlife trade altogether while carving out a broad array of exceptions for different species and market needs clearly hasn’t been effective. And although Shenzhen’s new guidelines are admirably clear, they likely go too far: One of the delights of any cuisine is variety, and banning all but the most common livestock outright will likely cause resentment that could set back the conservation movement. We need to assess the risks and conservation needs of each individual species before making a clear and definite decision one way or the other.

Meanwhile, we should take steps to lower demand for wild animals. There is research showing young Chinese are already less interested in wild animal consumption than older generations. We should encourage this trend through health and scientific education, such as by pointing out the lack of scientific evidence for most TCM remedies. Higher taxes can also be used to slowly discourage consumption of wild animal byproducts.

Changing long-ingrained eating habits will take time. Rather than rushing in with a blanket ban, we should rationally examine the issue, identify the core problems, and work to resolve them, step-by-step.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has marked out the Chinese pangolin as a critically endangered species

Several decades ago, pangolin, a mammal locally known as ""Banrui,"" could be seen in several regions of the country. Today, the animal is on the verge of extinction due to continuous poaching.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has marked out the Chinese pangolin as a critically endangered species.

What officials think

According to statistics compiled by Wildlife Crime Control Unit (WCCU) of Bangladesh Forest Department, at least 14 pangolins -dead and alive- have been rescued through 10 different drives since 2016 while being illegally captured or transported.

Among the nine rescued alive, two of them died later. All the living pangolins were released in Lawachara National Park (LNP) of Moulvibazar.

Mihir Kumar Doe, director of WCCU, said drives were undertaken on receipt of information. He noted, however, that most criminals remained unapprehended as they fled the scene in the face of the drives, leaving the animals behind.

A person can be given imprisonment of between two years and 12 years while fines can range from Tk1 lakh to Tk15 lakh for killing a mammal, or collecting, preserving, buying and selling, or transporting its meat, or any parts, according to the Wildlife (preservation and security) Act, 2012.

Professor Dr M Monirul H Khan, of the zoology department of Jahangirnagar University, told Dhaka Tribune: ""80% of the poaching goes unreported as only 20% of such cases are intercepted by law enforcers.""

“Indian and Chinese pangolins were previously found in Bangladesh. Indian pangolins were last spotted in the 1980s, but now only Chinese pangolins exist in Bangladesh,” he said.

According to him, pangolins can be found mainly in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), the hilly areas of Sylhet, Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar while some can be found in Mymensingh and Kurigram too.

“Whether the species will survive or face extinction depends on the protection measures taken by the government and awareness among the people,” he added.

Are there any pangolins in CHT now?

A study conducted by Creative Conservation Alliance in CHT and Lawachara between January 2015 and February 2016 found that CHT was a haven for pangolins, with the Mro (a tribal group) people hunting pangolins for food regularly.

The study, titled “Pangolin Distribution and Conservation Status in Bangladesh”, published on April 7, 2017 on a United Kingdom based journal PLOS ONE, says they came up with the findings by interviewing pangolin hunters and using camera traps to know of the status of pangolins.

In the course of the interviews, one hunter told researchers that he had hunted 32 pangolins between 2010 and 2014.

The study shows a decline in the number of pangolins owing to poaching. Interviewing many hunters, researchers came to know that only a total of 4 pangolins were killed by Mro hunters in 2015.

The camera trap survey, however, found no sign of pangolins.

The study states that pangolins were currently more abundant in LNP than in any other area in the CHT, but the number is unknown.

Muzaffar Faisal, a biologist and co-author of the study, thinks some pangolins may exist in CHT. “But we have found no pangolin during our study and did not get any information about pangolins existing in CHT after 2015,” he said.

Hot cake for poaching : Scale price is four times higher than tiger bones?

People from the indigenous Mro community hunt pangolins for food, but commercial traders have become involved in poaching since 2010.

Prices of pangolin scales are four times more than tiger and leopard bones while the price of a kilogram of scales is six times that of a live bear cub.

According to the study, tiger and leopard bones sell for $130 per kg and live bear cubs sell for $70.

On the other hand, the price of a kg of pangolin scales in the CHT ranged from $250 to $500. In Nepal the price is $500-$625 for a kg.

Almost all wildlife products are sold to traders from either Thanchi or Alikadam, the towns closest to the Mro villages. These products are intended for illegal export to Myanmar, likely destined for consumption in China.

How pangolin is used

Pangolin is a delicacy in China, Vietnam and Thailand. Its scales are used in traditional medicine, the market for which is huge.

According to the TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, a joint program of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and IUCN, every year 20 tons of pangolins and their parts are trafficked internationally.

China and Vietnam are the two primary consumer markets for pangolins. 1,000,000 pangolins are estimated to have been poached in the last decade.

What are pangolins?

The entire animal, except the face and lower part of the head and body, is covered by dark yellowish brown, large, broad and stout scales. It has a long snout and coils itself for protection.

Pangolins grow from 30cm to 100cm long, and weigh from two to 10kg. Their lifespan is about two decades.

They are nocturnal animals, roaming in the forests, digging up soil with their sharp nails in search of insects to eat, such as ants, termites and larvae.

They are important for the ecosystem as they help regulate insect populations. One single pangolin can consume around 70 million ants and termites per year. Thus, without them the ecological balance will be disrupted.

Pangolins in Bangladesh

● Pangolins were mainly in Chittagong Hill Tracts(CHT), Hilly areas of Sylhet, Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar

● They help regulate insect populations

● At least 14 pangolins have been rescued since 2016

● Pangolins were hunted for food by Mro people, but the number became insignificant after 2015

0,"Washington: Red pandas, the bushy-tailed and russet-furred bamboo munchers that dwell in Asian high forests are not a single species but rather two distinct ones, according to the most comprehensive genetic study to date on these endangered mammals.

Scientists said on Wednesday they found substantial divergences between the two species – Chinese red pandas and Himalayan red pandas – in three genetic markers in an analysis of DNA from 65 of the animals.

The recognition of the existence of two separate species could help guide conservation efforts for a mammal adored by many people even as its numbers dwindle in the wild, they added.

Chinese red pandas are found in northern Myanmar as well as southeastern Tibet, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces in China, while Himalayan red pandas are native to Nepal, India, Bhutan and southern Tibet in China, the researchers said.

International experts have estimated a total population of roughly 10,000 red pandas in the wild.

“To conserve the genetic uniqueness of the two species, we should avoid their interbreeding in captivity,” said the Chinese Academy of Sciences conservation biologist Yibo Hu, who along with colleague Fuwen Wei led the study published in the journal Science Advances. “Interbreeding between species may harm the genetic adaptations already established for their local habitat environment.”

Scientists previously recognised red pandas as divided into two subspecies. While it had been proposed that these were separate species, the new study was the first to provide the genetic data necessary to allow such a judgement.

The Himalayan red panda is the scarcer of the two and needs urgent protection because of low genetic diversity and small population size, Hu said. The Yalu Zangbu River most likely marks the geographical boundary separating the two species, not the Nujiang River as previously believed, Hu added.

The two species also differ in coloration and skull shape.

“The Himalayan red panda has more white on the face, while the face coat colour of the Chinese red panda is redder with less white on it. The tail rings of the Chinese red panda are more distinct than those of the Himalayan red panda, with the dark rings being darker red and the pale rings being more whitish,” Hu said.

Slightly bigger than a domestic cat, red pandas have thick fur, a short snout, and pointed ears, spending much of their life in trees and dining mostly on bamboo. Major threats to red pandas include deforestation and degradation of their habitat due to human development.

Despite similar names, red pandas and giant pandas are not closely related. Giant pandas are one of the world’s eight bear species.

Red pandas, with no close living relatives, are sometimes called living fossils as the only remaining member of the Ailuridae mammalian family. They are probably most closely related to a group that includes weasels, raccoons, and skunks.

0,"The term “aquatic wild meat,” or “marine bushmeat,” refers to the hunting of marine mammals, reptiles, seabirds and now some sharks and rays.

The hunting takes place all over the world and has increased in recent years as small-scale fishers have lost access to fish and other marine resources.

Last week, delegates representing more than 80 countries took steps to address the issue of aquatic wild meat at the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals conference in Gandhinagar, India.

Other outcomes of the conference included adding 10 new species to the convention’s protected lists, including the jaguar and Asian elephant, recognizing the culture of wild animals, and calling for migratory species to be considered in national climate and energy policies.

Scientists and conservationists have long expressed concern about the consumption of bushmeat, mindful of its impact on wildlife and human health. Yet the marine equivalent has received relatively little attention, even as dwindling resources have led more small-scale fishers in places such as West Africa to target dolphins, sea turtles and other mammals, reptiles and birds considered “aquatic wild meat.”

Delegates representing more than 80 countries took steps to address the issue at the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) conference in Gandhinagar, India, which concluded on Feb. 22. They agreed to develop an aquatic wild meat action plan for West Africa and to coordinate global protection efforts for species targeted as aquatic wild meat, including, for the first time, certain sharks and rays.

“Aquatic wild meat is on the rise and CMS is acknowledging that it is a fast-emerging threat on a scale similar to that facing terrestrial animals,” Fabienne McLellan, who attended the conference as co-director of international relations at OceanCare, a marine conservation NGO based in Switzerland, told Mongabay in an email. “People’s reliance on aquatic wild meat is growing across tropical, temperate, sub-Arctic as well as Arctic regions. So whales, dolphins, manatees, turtles, crocodiles, and seabirds are increasingly being targeted as a direct consequence of declining fish stock.”

Some NGO participants were not fully satisfied with the steps that CMS parties took, given the urgency to protect these species, many of which have long life spans and are slow to reproduce. But they expressed hope that this will mark the beginning of a broader push to protect overexploited aquatic wild meat species.

Aquatic wild what?

Scientists began speaking about aquatic wild meat in the 1990s and 2000s, initially calling it “marine bushmeat.” Threats to the concerned species have multiplied since then. Globally, people intentionally kill about 100,000 small whales, dolphins and porpoises from at least 56 species every year, according to a 2019 report by multiple conservation groups. Recent research shows that the number of small cetaceans killed in hunts is increasing, including in places such as the Amazon basin and the waters near Ghana.

The hunt is not always driven by an immediate need for protein. In Latin America and Asia, people use the flesh and blubber of small cetaceans for bait because of its durability on hooks and its desirability to targeted fish species. In West Africa, people seek dolphin oil as a medicinal cream for children.

Some aquatic wild meat hunting is illegal, such as the extensive sea turtle poaching in the “Coral Triangle” region of Southeast Asia. However, much of it is legal. Many countries don’t have legislation that protects aquatic wild meat species. (The Marine Mammal Protection Act in the U.S. is a strong exception.)

For example, many Caribbean island nations have no laws protecting small whales and dolphins. People on the main island of St. Vincent and the Grenadines hunt several hundred small cetaceans per year, according to Russell Fielding, a visiting environmental studies lecturer at the University of the West Indies in Barbados. This hunting gets less attention than that on the small Grenadine island of Bequia, which uses a special aboriginal license from the International Whaling Commission, the body that regulates catch of large whales, to hunt four humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) per year. However, the lower-profile hunting on St. Vincent accounts for a lot more biomass, Fielding said.

Eating aquatic wild meat poses serious public health risks, he said. The small cetaceans in the area are apex predators that concentrate pollutants, which have moved up the food chain, in their tissues.

“When people eat them, we become the apex predator, and we ingest all these pollutants,” Fielding told Mongabay. His research indicates that the mammals’ muscles, blubber and internal organs are full of microplastics and industrial pollutants such as mercury. Every sample of small-cetacean tissue his teams have tested has had mercury levels above the threshold considered safe by the World Heath Organization — on average 3 to 48 times the recommended limit.

Fielding said he’s moved from focusing solely on research to becoming something of an activist in trying to spread the word about these dangers. So far, though, governments in the eastern Caribbean haven’t taken action to curtail the consumption of aquatic wild meat, he said.

Driven to hunt

The growth in demand for aquatic wild meat is likely due to global consumption of other marine resources, which has increased significantly since 1950, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Climate breakdown has played a role by, for example, shifting the locations of fish further offshore where small-scale fishers can’t access them. Scientists have found that decreased fish availability can lead to more hunting of terrestrial bushmeat in coastal areas, and now the same hunting trend can be seen at sea.

Efforts to curb local hunts have been largely ineffective, and in some cases may have backfired by inspiring local resistance to outsider values. Some conservationists are now pushing for an approach that addresses the root causes of the hunting phenomenon, and in West Africa industrial overfishing is a big one, according to Maximin Djondo, an aquatic wild meat specialist at OceanCare. There, industrial fishing vessels outperform local fishers by more than 20 times, according to a 2016 OceanCare report.

“Fishers get less and less fish due to international vessels, mostly Chinese, that come into West African waters and take everything,” Djondo, who’s based in Benin, told Mongabay. “People now don’t get as many fish, so they’re more interested in aquatic wild meat.”

OceanCare expressed disappointment that the CMS conference did not lead to concrete action to address overexploitation by industrial vessels. “There is no change from ‘business as usual,’” its delegates to the conference wrote in a press release.

The convention’s impact

The legality of hunting many marine species is difficult to determine. CMS strictly prohibits the take of endangered migratory species listed as Appendix I, its highest level of protection. In theory, the 130 signatory parties to CMS either automatically hold the treaty’s resolutions as law or must enact legislation that matches the resolutions. In practice, though, some countries don’t enact legislation.

Even when countries have the right laws, enforcement is difficult. The CMS secretariat has less ability to enforce its resolutions than the secretariat of a companion convention, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which can issue trade sanctions for noncompliance. Also, some countries with large foreign fishing fleets, such as China and Japan, aren’t signatories to CMS, so their flagged vessels aren’t required to comply with the convention’s provisions, according to Brett Sommermeyer, the legal director of Sea Shepherd Legal, a Seattle-based law firm affiliated with the NGO Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

Migratory species face myriad pressures aside from hunting, and the results are dire. The first-ever review of the status of CMS-listed species, published earlier this month in preparation for the recent conference, shows that the populations of most of those species are going down, according to a CMS press release.

Even so, efforts to strengthen CMS floundered at the conference: a proposed resolution [pdf] that would have expanded the convention’s remit to include trade restrictions on species threatened with extinction failed to pass and was replaced with a call for research into the issue. The Australian and European Union delegations opposed the proposal, according to Sommermeyer, and that’s what tanked it, an OceanCare staff member who attended the conference told Mongabay. (An Australian delegate did not respond to Mongabay’s requests for comment; an EU delegate declined to comment.)

Still, observers pointed to positive developments. CMS added 10 new species to its lists conferring protected status, including seven on Appendix I: jaguar (Panthera onca), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus), great Indian bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps), Antipodean albatross (Diomedea antipodensis), Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis), little bustard (Tetrax tetrax), and oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus).

The parties moved to recognize the culture of wild animals, including variations in social structures, behaviors and dialects that can occur within a single species. They called for migratory species to be considered in national climate and energy policies, especially when building infrastructure, and for reduced bycatch of marine mammals in commercial fisheries.

On the final day of the conference, CMS parties released the Gandhinagar Declaration calling for the inclusion of migratory species and the concept of “ecological connectivity” into the framework adopted at the U.N. Biodiversity Conference this coming October.

Consumption of the animal has been made illegal in a country where pangolin meat is considered a delicacy, as authorities work to contain the spread of the deadly virus believed to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan.

The Chinese pangolin — which is considered critically endangered — has been included in the ban on eating all wildlife.

However, campaigners have warned that the consumption of the scaly mammals is not the “main threat” to the species.

Dr Teresa Telecky, vice president of wildlife for animal welfare NGO Humane Society International, told The Independent: “While pangolins are consumed for their meat as a delicacy, their scales are consumed as medicine.”

She said: “While the new ban should stop the eating of pangolins, it will not stop the farming and trade of pangolin scales, which is the main threat to the eight species of pangolins.”

Dr Telecky said it was “unclear” how the consumption ban would affect the animals, whose population is decreasing across China, according to the IUCN.

Chinese researchers have linked pangolins to the spread of the new coronavirus, which has infected nearly 80,000 people to date.

However, their claim has been challenged by other scientists across the globe.

Pangolins are a protected species in China, and laws already restricted their trade before the new ban on the trade of all wild animals for consumption.

However, they remain in high demand across the country, where they are traded on the black market.

China announced a clampdown on its citizens eating wild animals — including badgers, turtles and pangolins — last week, as the country battles its coronavirus outbreak.

Dr Telecky from HSI said: “We welcome China’s ban on consumption of wild animals as food as it will save hundreds of thousands of animals each year from cruel treatment in this trade, assuming the ban is strongly implemented and enforced.""

0,"The world’s fastest land animal, the cheetah, which became extinct in India 70 years ago, may return to the country as wildlife experts have said the species’ protected areas have been restored and the Supreme Court has given the goahead for a Cheetah resettlement plan. The move to bring back Cheetahs was articulated at the recent Conference of Parties to the Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species and Wild Animals held in Gandhinagar.

The apex court, which had in 2013 struck down the big cat’s rehabilitation plan calling it arbitrary and illegal, in January this year gave its nod to a plan that envisages bringing the animals from Namibia and resettling them in Indian reserves. There have been mixed reactions from conservationists to this ambitious project, some of whom feel it is a case of misplaced priorities.

They fear that the cheetah project may take away the focus from other species on the verge of extinction such as the great Indian Bustard, Bengal florican, wild buffalo, dugong and the Manipur browantlered deer. The project to relocate Asiatic lions from the Gir forests in Gujarat to Kuno in Madhya Pradesh, which has been several decades in the making, is nowhere near completion.

A scheme to relocate tigers from Madhya Pradesh to Odisha, the first inter-state tiger relocation programme, had to be called off after a tiger died and another one attacked humans. The Cheetah was declared extinct from India in 1952 and if it is reintroduced, India will be the only country in Asia to have all the major big cats in the wild, including lions, tigers and leopards. There are only 7,000 Cheetahs left in the wild globally and any move to translocate them from Africa to India has to be done with great caution as it would have very significant conservation ramifications.

The Centre and state governments have not shown much alacrity in translocating the Asiatic lions, which are found in the wild only in Gujarat, and there is serious concern that an infection or natural calamity can wipe out the last surviving population of the big cats. According to the 2015 Census, there are about 523 lions in Gujarat and over 200 lions died in 2017 and 2018 because of a mystery disease.

Despite the Supreme Court directing their translocation, there has been an inordinate delay in shifting the Gir lions from Gujarat to neighbouring Madhya Pradesh. Political grandstanding and bureaucratic red-tape appear to have stalled the project to move the lions and there is little hope that it will be done in the near future. Under these circumstances, the Cheetah project, which involves bringing the cats from distant Namibia and resettling them in forests in central India, is another enterprise that will take years to unfold.",Cheetah project,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiENR8Ob2uBSRKZ-W4tToCLyUqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow-az7CjDR8PMCMIOs2wU?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/QT-O3.jpg,2020-03-01,"{'sent': 'The world’s fastest land animal, the cheetah, which became extinct in India 70 years ago, may return to the country as wildlife experts have said the species’ protected areas have been restored and the Supreme Court has given the goahead for a Cheetah resettlement plan.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['India'], 'ORG': ['the Supreme Court'], 'PERSON': ['Cheetah']}}",Bengal Florican
0,"While pandemics and major epidemics have been defining moments throughout history, compared to now, they used to be relatively rare. That’s changing this century: first came SARS, then the swine flu, MERS, a new outbreak of Ebola, Zika, Dengue fever, and now COVID-19. And while scientists race to develop a vaccine and drugs for the new coronavirus, that won’t solve the larger problem. There’s a clear link between the spread of viruses and the relationship between humans and the natural world—and if that relationship doesn’t change, we can expect to see more pandemics in the near future, some of which may be far deadlier than COVID-19.

“The difference between today and 100 years ago is that we’re dismantling the living world at a rate that’s unprecedented in human history,” says Aaron Bernstein, director of the Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital. “We’ve got climate change, which is pushing every living thing that isn’t human to the poles, more or less, to get out of the heat. We’re radically changing how we do business with the biosphere. And that creates the opportunity for viruses and bacteria to get into new species that they weren’t in before.”

In some cases, the link is very direct. The current outbreak seems to have started at a Chinese market that sold wild animals for food, including wolf pups, civets, bamboo rats, and crocodiles; pangolins, a type of anteater, may have been the vector. The animals, now endangered, have been illegal to sell there for more than a decade, but the laws haven’t been widely enforced. “It’s just insane, in today’s world, to have global trade in wildlife and wildlife parts, because that’s taking something that used to be isolated and moving it all around the world into highly populated areas,” says Lee Hannah, a scientist at the nonprofit Conservation International. “Coronavirus is nothing compared to what’s out there—just think about Ebola.”

Before the world was as closely connected, viral outbreaks were sometimes more limited. “When these diseases were passed to humans, sometimes, like flu, they become well entrenched and entered the human ecosystem, but other times, the really nasty ones would impact possibly a community of forest people, and it might wipe out a village,” Hannah says. “But it wouldn’t wipe out the whole planet. When we start trading wildlife all around the planet and seeing declines in the health of nature, then you face the prospect of those diseases that used to die out in an isolated, lowly populated forest somewhere spreading all around the world.”

Urbanization and globalization also mean that when a virus jumps from an animal to a human, it can now spread quickly. Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, is one example of the overall trend. The city sprawled between 2000 and 2018, tripling in size, while new rail lines and flights connected it to the rest of China and the world.

China has taken new action to stem illegal wildlife trade, and shut down wildlife markets, though it remains to be seen how permanent the changes will be (after the SARS outbreak, which was also linked to wildlife markets, the markets closed only temporarily.) But eating wild animals is only one part of the problem. As humans continue to expand into previously uninhabited areas, it’s more likely that humans will come in contact with viruses that circulate in animals. There are more than a million viruses similar to new coronavirus; one organization has documented more than 500 different types of coronaviruses in bats alone. As forests are logged and oceans are overfished, pressure on animals increases, which may increase the chance that they get sick. Stress from climate change, including if it forces some animals to move, could also make it more likely that they get sick.

It’s critical, Hannah says, that nature is protected in a way that can keep ecosystems healthy. “We want to reenvision humans’ relationship with nature, and have a healthy relationship between people and nature,” he says. The recent Convention on Biological Diversity suggests aiming to preserve 30% of the planet for nature—a small fraction, but something that could easily be lost as the human population grows and agriculture expands.",Why our shrinking natural world is increasing the pace of global pandemics,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDQ3NjY1Ny93aHktb3VyLXNocmlua2luZy1uYXR1cmFsLXdvcmxkLWlzLWluY3JlYXNpbmctdGhlLXBhY2Utb2YtZ2xvYmFsLXBhbmRlbWljc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2020/03/p-1-90476657-naturecorona.jpg",2020-03-13,"{'sent': 'That’s changing this century: first came SARS, then the swine flu, MERS, a new outbreak of Ebola, Zika, Dengue fever, and now COVID-19.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Dengue', 'Ebola', 'Zika']}}",Pangolin

The World Health Organization has categorized the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) as a pandemic in light of its spread around the world. Ever since the first cases emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December, there’s been much speculation — and misinformation — about the origins of the virus. And while scientists suspect it may have come from a market in Wuhan when a diseased animal was consumed or butchered, spilling over into the human population from there, the issue is far from settled.

To give a better understanding of the origin of the coronavirus and what can be done to stop the future spread of disease from animals to humans, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and Global Wildlife Conservation have partnered on a series of new infographics.

WCS is also providing regular updates on wildlife-related issues surrounding COVID-19, and has taken to Twitter to address some of the most common rumors about the disease. These range from the demonstrably false — that the virus was manufactured in a lab — to the unfounded (for instance, that we know with full certainty which animal host passed the disease to humans).

“It is most likely that the evolutionary or ancestral host was a bat,” Chris Walzer, executive director of health at WCS, told Mongabay. “What we don’t know is how the virus got into humans and which possible intermediary host it passed through.”

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses with exceptionally high mutation rates that are known to exist in bats, rodents, camels and cats, making them prime for jumping from animal hosts to humans. The viruses that caused the outbreaks of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) from 2002-2004 are categorized as coronaviruses.

See all our coverage of zoonotic diseases including COVID-19 here

Viruses naturally mutate and are able to recombine, sharing different components to create new viruses. So wildlife trading and meat markets, where multiple live species are kept together and butchered on the same surfaces, prove a perfect breeding ground for novel pathogens.

“The animals are captured in the wild (or alternatively raised on a so-called wildlife farm) and transported to a market, where they interact with other species from other locations,” Walzer said. “Here, the animals are confined under stressful conditions, exchanging excrements and thus viruses before being slaughtered on-site. This allows for blood and organs to be exposed and increases the interface to humans.”

“It’s just a numbers game,” Walzer said. “If you just put enough species together and allow them to share viruses and then put a lot of people in contact with the animals and their parts, then you just invariably will have a virus that can enter a human cell and replicate and, in rarer occasions, transmit from human to human.”

Given the clear risks both to biodiversity as well as to human health, scientists at WCS and GWC are calling for a permanent ban on wildlife trafficking and live animal markets.

The COVID-19 epidemic may be the watershed to spur action on wildlife trafficking in Southeast Asia. China has announced a ban on the consumption of wild animals; Vietnam followed with a ban on both the trade and consumption of wildlife.

“Taking China’s lead, I think there will be a domino effect in the region, as all of these neighboring countries are highly interdependent and their markets are connected,” Walzer said. “These countries have legislation for livestock in place. Now, they are asking how to best regulate wildlife. What laws, expertise and monitoring are needed to really implement this legislation in a meaningful way?”

“Public attention can fade quickly. But once legislation is in place, it is there to stay.”

Cambodia, Laos and Indonesia have not made a formal statement yet on bans, but Walzer says these countries have indicated they are looking into regulating the wildlife trade and investigating what needs to be done.

“The world needs country after country stepping up to prevent future viral outbreaks by banning the trade and consumption of wildlife.” Hoang Bich Thuy, country director of WCS Vietnam, said in a statement. “If just one country continues to allow the trade in wildlife, communities across the world will continue to suffer and pay the price.”

This norm of theirs often invites trouble to the outside world- as by bringing in unusual animals into our food chain, we introduce new pathogens and viruses in our society which were otherwise absent.

Let us look at some of those endangered wild animals people notoriously eat.

Chinese Giant Salamander

The world’s largest amphibian that can weigh over 64kgs is being eaten into extinction. The Chinese Giant Salamander is often hunted down in China as it is an important ingredient in Chinese luxury food market.

Chimpanzees & Gorillas

Gorillas and Chimpanzees are widely eaten across Africa as a part of bushmeat. While some reports fear that the consumption of bushmeat can be the cause of next HIV, gorillas are already on the verge of extinction.

Fin Whales

This species is on the verge of extinction thanks to habitat loss, climate change and of course, extensive fishing. Found in the North Atlantic, these whales are hunted down for oil, meat and baleen. Although endangered, you can find its canned meat in Japanese markets.

Indian Purple Frog

Found in the southern parts of Western Ghats, this species of frog are on the verge of extinction because of agriculture and tadpole harvesting by the local communities. The locals consider the tadpoles a delicacy, thus putting a check on the endangered amphibian’s population.

Pangolin

Being one of the world’s most hunted animal is taking a toll on this anteater’s population. Illegal hunting and high demand for its meat and scales in China and Vietnam are not helping this scaly mammal’s population.

African Forest Elephant

Not only for their tusks, African beasts are highly prized in the black market for their meat. While some cultures consider the meat from their tusks as a delicacy, some prefer consuming the elephant’s genitals to boost sexual prowess.

There are several other animals that can be included in this list, which points out how human population, their tradition and culture are putting different species at risk. Although several animal welfare organisations have taken steps to spread awareness, yet there are several communities who hide behind the mask of ignorance, putting the ecosystem at risk.

On February 24, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s top legislature body, issued a decision to totally ban the illegal trade and consumption of wildlife as food. Use of wild animals for medicine, pets, and scientific research will be subject to “strict examination and approval” by the supervising departments. On March 31, Guangdong province became the first Chinese province to revise its local regulation on wildlife protection. From May 1, 2020, anyone who eats wild animals of national priority protection may be fined up to 20 times the value of the wildlife.

Op/Ed by Chris Devonshire-Ellis

Eating pangolins and other wild animals – what do China’s wildlife protection laws say?

While the source of the now-named Covid-19 coronavirus that has so seriously affected China has yet to be fully determined, suspicions are falling upon the Chinese Pangolin (Manis pentadactyla) as the most likely creature to have harbored the virus and then passed it to humans. 99 percent of the RNA of a coronavirus found in Pangolins is identical to Covid-19.

Pangolins are a type of anteater yet are considered a gourmet food across much of Asia. They are, however, endangered and are listed as a Category 2 protected species by CITES, to which China is a signatory. There have been calls to upgrade the pangolins’ status to Category 1, the highest, as its population has plummeted in the past decade, mainly as a result of poaching.

This means there is a disconnect between wildlife protection treaties that China signs up to and the actual behavior of some of its own citizens. That is an educational issue, and better wildlife protection and education of the Chinese of a national basis of the perils in consuming such creatures may have prevented such a catastrophe of the type we see today.

Covid-19, meanwhile, may just prove to be the savior of Chinese pangolins. They are unlikely to be back on the menu anytime soon.

Pangolins are used both as a gourmet meal – they are said to be delicious while the scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). There are decent profits to be made by poachers; the meat sells for close to US$300 a kilo, while the scales fetch up to US$3,000 a kilogram.

Sun Xiuqing, a TCM doctor at Jingshan Hospital in Beijing was quoted saying in this rather distressing article that “Roast pangolin scales are used, combined with other TCM material, to promote blood circulation, dispel clotting or swelling, and it is used more often on women who want to stimulate lactation after giving birth, or on people who suffer from cancer.”

This tradition continues despite studies showing that there is no apparent benefit from consuming pangolin scales at all – they are made of keratin, the same as human fingernails.

So, the Chinese have signed up to CITES, but what do China’s own laws in terms of wildlife protection say?

China has a Wildlife Protection Law of the People’s Republic of China (amended in 2018).

According to this, all wildlife under national protection is divided into Grade I and Grade II categories of protection. This is reviewed every 5 years. Grade 1 animals are rarer and are under tighter protection, which means hunting them illegally may be punished more severely, while obtaining approvals for special license hunting is more difficult – applications need to be made to the Wildlife Conservation Department, which is under the direction of the State Council.

The most recent lists of protected animals in China can be found here . China generally follows CITES categorization, the panda, for example, is Grade 1 protected, while pangolins are Grade 2. According to the law, it is forbidden to hunt or kill wildlife under national protection (Article 21) without holding a special hunting license.

Article 41 outlines the penalties for breaking the law and illegally hunting nationally protected wild animals. These are:

Confiscation of hunted objects, tools, and illegal gains;

Revocation of other hunting licenses;

A fine of more than two times and less than ten times the value of the property seized; if no property is seized, a fine of 10,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan (US$1,434 to US$7,173) shall be imposed; and

If a crime is constituted, criminal responsibility shall be investigated according to law.

This now brings us to China’s Criminal Law on the subject, where Article 341 states: illegal hunting and killing rare and endangered wildlife under special state protection shall be sentenced to up to 10 years fixed-term imprisonment, along with fines and confiscation of property. The clause in full:

“Whoever illegally catches or kills the species of wildlife under special state protection which are rare or near extinction, or illegally purchases, transports or sells the species of wildlife under special state protection which are rare or near extinction and their products shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years or criminal detention and concurrently be sentenced to a fine; if the circumstances are serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than five years and not more than ten years and concurrently be sentenced to a fine; if the circumstances are especially serious, the offender shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not less than ten years and concurrently be sentenced to a fine or confiscation of property.

Whoever, in violation of game laws or regulations, hunts in a game reserve, during a period when hunting is prohibited or using implements or methods that are prohibited, thereby damaging wildlife resources shall, if the circumstances are serious, be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than three years, criminal detention, public surveillance or a fine.”

There appears to be no differences between punishments handed out for abuses of animals in Grade 1, or Grade 2, which leads us to believe these are probably discretionary. The Criminal Law especially is hard on convicted poachers, although the Wildlife law is less severe. Given that the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation (CBCGDF) estimates 60,000 wild pangolins were killed in China in 2018 alone, it is obvious the law, while on the statute, is not being upheld.

Pangolin can fairly easily be sourced in China, and there is a vibrant, if illegal online market for not just pangolin but other wildlife products. This is an image of them that appeared on the Pinduoduo website (subsequently removed):

The outbreak of Covid-19 therefore has serious educational, regulatory, and industry implications for China. These can be identified as follows:

China’s wildlife laws need to be upgraded in terms of applicable punishment. Whoever caught and sold a suspected pangolin in Wuhan did so for a profit of a few hundred dollars. The impact cost will run into hundreds of billions of dollars and produce a death toll way into the hundreds.

China’s criminal laws need to be enforced in every case of breaching the wildlife laws and the tough sentences already described within them implemented.

There are additional, wider ranging, and more problematic issues to deal with in the longer term.

Online stores in China should face stiffer penalties for advertising illegal products;

China’s traditional wet markets need to be better governed and managed, including regular and thorough checks. Vendors and the Chinese rural population, in particular, need better education concerning hygiene, the quality of produce, the desirability of keeping differing food products apart, ban the sale of wild animals, and curtail the entrance of wild animals such as birds, pigeons, and rodents;

Wealthier Chinese need to be properly educated about the risks of eating wild animals. “Face” can be obtained instead via an expensive bottle of cognac or rare maotai – this is an educational and marketing issue;

Chinese traditional medicine (TCM) is a multi-billion dollar industry in China, yet it is partially responsible for upholding discredited beliefs and quackery. It needs to be far better regulated. The consumption of items, such as pangolin scales, is rooted in the medieval, Ming dynasty past and does not belong to the modern, scientific society China aims to be.

Bringing the TCM market under better scientific and regulatory control will be a massive task for the CCP. The global market for products is estimated to be worth US$50 billion per annum, and many practitioners swear by it. However, many of the ingredients can be synthesized, and others are long based in ridiculous theories – consuming tiger penis making men more virile, for example. Dealing with TCM’s popularity in China is a huge political ask while the basis for it remains a symbol of national pride and beliefs. There are some acknowledged benefits to many TCM applications; however, the results of these can vary from patient to patient unless the specific active beneficial ingredient can be found. Yet, many preparations are against conducting such research; maintaining the mystery is a preferred sales and magical recovery tool.

Yet, it is clear such beliefs are partially responsible for the Covid-19 outbreak. Somehow the CCP need to find a way to deal with the issue. Writing in Forbes, Sergei Klebnikov says that the World Bank estimates that at best outcome, providing the Covid-19 outbreak doesn’t become more serious, global growth will be impacted by about US$500 billion this year. The political question for China is this: With the TCM industry worth US$50 billion, how many more outbreaks is it going to take before the government starts to make TCM, its beliefs, practices, and trading standards more accountable? And when will it start to uphold its own laws? China, and its own citizens, need to take stock of which traditions are valuable in their society, and in the aftermath of the coronavirus, which ones should now be cast aside.

Their size has always impressed me. Japanese giant salamanders are the second-largest salamander species in the world. They can get up to 5 feet long and weigh 55 pounds. They have this big tail that is laterally compressed (flattened from side to side) that helps them move through the water. We see that with the other salamanders in the cryptobranchid family, including the Chinese giant salamander and the hellbender. They are very slow-moving though, so they don’t take off swimming a lot.

People think of amphibians as delicate, but Japanese giant salamanders are very tough and resilient. Males get a lot more aggressive and active during the breeding season and will fight with each other. They can get beat up, but they heal like Wolverine. They can even lose limbs and recover just fine, even though their limbs won’t grow back.

How do they breathe underwater?

Oxygen goes in through their skin and carbon dioxide goes out – that’s how the respiration process works underwater. These guys are very long and flat, and they have folds in their skin that create a lot of surface area for that respiration to occur. They also live in fast-moving streams, and moving water tends to have more dissolved oxygen than still water. If they get caught in stagnant water, they will actually rock their bodies to get the water moving so that they can keep breathing.

Tell us about the Japanese giant salamanders that live at Reptile Discovery Center.

We have four Japanese giant salamanders at the Zoo – two females and two males – that were gifted to us from Asa Zoo in Japan in 2009. They are already about 2 feet long, and our biggest male weighs about 6 kilograms (13 pounds). He was named Hiro by the Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. in 2010. We refer to the other three by their physical characteristics: Orange Male, Full-tail Female and Notch-tail Female.

The girls are both really chill. Orange Male tends to be the greediest and to beg for food the most. Hiro tends to be the most aggressive, so he is kind of the bully of the group. If they are all hanging out in the same den and he wants to be in that space, he will push his way in – even if the other salamanders are blocking the entrance. Orange Male lives on exhibit right now, while the others live in the breeding area behind the scenes. They are all about 20 years old, but Japanese giant salamanders have been recorded living over 50 years in human care. We wouldn’t be surprised if these guys live to be 60 or 70.",New at the Zoo: Japanese Giant Salamander,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmF0aW9uYWx6b28uc2kuZWR1L2FuaW1hbHMvbmV3cy9uZXctem9vLWphcGFuZXNlLWdpYW50LXNhbGFtYW5kZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://nationalzoo.si.edu/sites/default/files/newsroom/japanese-giant-salamander-exhibit-002.jpg,2020-04-03,"{'sent': 'They can get up to 5 feet long and weigh 55 pounds.', 'ents': {'QUANTITY': ['55 pounds', 'up to 5 feet']}}",Chinese Giant Salamander

Just one big story today: collecting and sorting through what we know about the coronavirus’s origins, and what makes sense and what doesn’t in the theory that it originated from someone eating bats or pangolins from the Huanan Seafood Market.

What We Know and What We Don’t Know about the Source of COVID-19

Early on in this crisis, I read a November 2017 Smithsonian magazine article entitled, “Is China Ground Zero for a Future Pandemic?” (Give that reporter, editor, and headline writer a raise.)

At least two flu pandemics in the past century—in 1957 and 1968—originated in the Middle Kingdom and were triggered by avian viruses that evolved to become easily transmissible between humans. Although health authorities have increasingly tried to ban the practice, millions of live birds are still kept, sold and slaughtered in crowded markets each year. In a study published in January, researchers in China concluded that these markets were a “main source of H7N9 transmission by way of human-poultry contact and avian-related environmental exposures.” . . . China is uniquely positioned to create a novel flu virus that kills people. On Chinese farms, people, poultry and other livestock often live in close proximity. Pigs can be infected by both bird flu and human flu viruses, becoming potent “mixing vessels” that allow genetic material from each to combine and possibly form new and deadly strains. The public’s taste for freshly killed meat, and the conditions at live markets, create ample opportunity for humans to come in contact with these new mutations. . . . Despite such shortcomings, Western experts say Chinese officials have come a long way since their wobbly handling of the 2002 outbreak of SARS, the severe respiratory disease caused by a previously unknown coronavirus; Chinese apparatchiks initially tried to cover up the epidemic, creating a worldwide scandal.

From that point until I started doing the research for Friday’s article, “The Trail Leading Back to the Wuhan Labs,” I figured the vague but clear-enough explanation from our government’s health officials made the most sense: “Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.” When a virus appears at the kind of insanitary markets that virologists had been warning about for years, it makes sense to apply Occam’s razor: The simplest explanation is usually the right one.

But that Smithsonian magazine article describes a lot of animals being slaughtered and sold at those markets: chickens, pigeons, quail, ducks, rabbits, pigs. You may notice one or two particular species that were not mentioned on that list.

You can find a lot of coverage of wet markets and quite a few references to the potential threat of a viral outbreak before this year — in Food Safety News, in the Singapore-based Today Online, the Japan Times, Agri-Pulse, the Daily Mail, KCRG, Culinary Backstreets, The Economist (disturbing picture of dog meat at that link), and the South China Morning Post, Foreign Policy, and CNN among others.

Those articles describe vendors selling dog meat, cats, pigs, sheep, cows, turtles, frogs, snakes, rats, foxes, and minxes.

But for what it’s worth, those articles don’t describe or mention vendors selling bats or pangolins, the anteater-like other animal species that is suspected to be a possible “transfer species” — i.e, the bat gives COVID-19 to the pangolin, some human being either eats or otherwise comes in contact with the pangolin, and contracts the virus. This doesn’t mean that those markets never sold bats or pangolins. But it does mean that they weren’t common enough to be easily witnessed and mentioned in news coverage.

(Interestingly, in 2019, a Daily Mail article reported upon the numerous unusual species openly sold at the Tomohon Extreme Market, located on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, including bats and dogs. I warn you, there are some seriously disturbing pictures at the link.)

There are a sufficient number of examples of human beings deliberately eating bats around the world to dismiss the “no one would ever eat a bat” argument (Although even if you didn’t find the thought inherently gross, there has to be relatively little meat on the bone compared to other species.)

Then again, vendors trading in those animals probably did their best to keep their merchandise secret. Back in 2013, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature declared the Chinese pangolin “more than likely the most traded wild mammals globally.” Back in late 2016, Quartz wrote that about 10,000 pangolins are smuggled into China from Southeast Asia each year, and described massive seizures of the animals carcasses from smugglers across Asia.

Keep in mind, there may not have been an intermediary species. One of the few fleeting references to a Chinese wet market selling bats came back in 2013 in the Wall Street Journal, in what amounted to a disturbingly prophetic report:

A decade after SARS swept through the world and killed more than 750 people, scientists have made a troubling discovery: A very close cousin of the SARS virus lives in bats and it can likely jump directly to people. The findings create new fears about the emergence of diseases like SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. The virus spread quickly from person to person in 2003 and had a mortality rate of at least 9%. Worries of a severe pandemic led the World Health Organization to issue an emergency travel advisory. While bats have previously been fingered as a host for SARS, it was believed that the virus jumped from there to weasel-like mammals known as civets, where it went through genetic changes before infecting people. Operating on that belief, China cracked down on markets where bats, civets and other wildlife were sold for food. The new bat-to-human discovery suggests that the control tactic may have limited effectiveness because a SARS-like virus remains loose in the wild and could potentially spark another outbreak. SARS is caused by a germ known as a coronavirus. First discovered in 2003 in southern China, SARS went on to sicken more than 8,000 people in more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, before it was contained. No known cases have been reported anywhere since 2004. But a key puzzle remained. No one ever found a live SARS virus in bats found in southern China’s wildlife markets, making it unclear that those bats were the source. So where did it come from? Dr. Daszak and his colleagues chose to study a horseshoe bat colony in Yunnan province in southwest China—hundreds of miles from the big wildlife-for-food markets of Guangdong province, where SARS was first reported. The researchers took hundreds of samples from the horseshoe bats. A genetic analysis revealed at least seven different strains of SARS-like coronaviruses circulating in that single group of animals. Crucially, the scientists were also able to isolate and culture a live virus that binds to a receptor on a human cell. That suggests that direct bat-to-human infection would likely occur.

This recent assessment from two microbiologists in Australia, John S. Mackenzie and David W. Smith, throws a little more cold water on the theory that COVID-19 jumped to humans through pangolins:

Evidence from the sequence analyses clearly indicates that the reservoir host of the virus was a bat, probably a Chinese or Intermediate horseshoe bat, and it is probable that, like SARS-CoV, an intermediate host was the source of the outbreak. To ensure that future cross-species transmission events of this new virus don’t occur again in the future, it is important to identify the reservoir and intermediate wildlife hosts. The closest known wildlife sequence to SARS-CoV-2 remains the sequence from the virus isolated from an Intermediate horseshoe bat, but there were significant differences in the receptor-binding domain between the two viruses. Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) have been suggested as potential intermediate hosts, and SARS-like viruses have been identified in pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China, but they only shared about 85–92% homology with SARS-CoV-218. No other possible intermediate wildlife host has been proposed at this time.

Those Australian microbiologists want a ban on wet markets and more enforcement of the ban on the trade of exotic species. But they also make an important point that we do not know, with absolute certainty, that the first cases were a result of someone eating bats or pangolins:

How this virus moved from animal to human populations is yet to be determined. The outbreak clearly began epidemiologically at the Wuhan market, and a number of environmental samples from around the live animal section of the market were subsequently found to be positive for SARS-CoV-212, but based on current evidence, it may not have actually emerged in the market. The earliest recognised case of infection with SARS-CoV-2 was an elderly and infirm man who developed symptoms on 1 December 2019. None of his family members became infected, and the source of his virus remains unknown13. Furthermore, 14 of the first 41 cases had no contact with the seafood market13. In another report, five of the first seven cases of COVID-19 had no link to the seafood market14. Thus, it seems very likely that the virus was amplified in the market, but the market might not have been the site of origin nor the only source of the outbreak. A recent phylo-epidemiological study has suggested that the virus was circulating but unrecognised in November, and was imported to the seafood market from elsewhere, where it subsequently was amplified15.

That study, found here, looked at the genomic data (mapping the genomes of the known samples of the virus to see how it is changing) and concluded:

H3 mutated to the H1 by two substitutions, and none of the Market samples encoded H3 in the currently available samples, suggesting that H3 might have originated and spread outside of the Market before an early stage of population expansion. The non-synonymous mutation from H3 to H1 might have enhanced the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2, and a functional characterization should be performed to confirm this speculation. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 in the Market had been transmitted from other places (Figure 3D), or at least, that the Market did not host the original source of SARS-CoV-2 (Cohen, 2020). As the first identified infected patients had no link to the Market (Huang et al., 2020), it is possible that infected humans transmitted the H1 haplotype of SARS-CoV-2 to workers or sellers in the market, after which it rapidly circulated there due to its special surroundings.

Could a vendor at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan or elsewhere in the city have sold bats or pangolins for human consumption? Sure. But as of now, we don’t know that any of them did; that is an assumption.

We do know for certain that two laboratories in the city — the Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention and the Wuhan Institute of Virology — were researching coronaviruses in bats. While it is theoretically possible that Dr. Botao Xiao is insane and/or just making it all up, his withdrawn research paper offered the surprisingly specific contention that 605 bats in total were being used in research at Wuhan Center for Disease Control & Prevention.

Yunnan province is about 850 miles from Wuhan, China. Horseshoe bats do not hibernate in cities.

The scenario where a horseshoe bat carrying COVID-19 naturally flew into the city is an extremely unlikely scenario. It is possible that someone trapped a bat 850 miles away from the city and brought it to the market to be sold for consumption. But that explanation doesn’t quite fit with the early patients who couldn’t be traced back to the market, and the genome mapping suggesting that the strain discovered at the one patient who they knew had been to the market wasn’t the original strain.

But if someone who worked at either of the two laboratories in the city researching coronaviruses in bats had been accidentally infected, and then that person traveled through the city, unwittingly infecting others, and then that person or one of the newly infected persons went to the market, becoming a “super-spreader”. . . that scenario would fit all of the available evidence that is known at this time.

Oh, wait, I’m sorry, the spread couldn’t have happened that way. Vox assures us, “The emergence of the virus in the same city as China’s only level 4 biosafety lab, it turns out, is pure coincidence.” And as that publication declared at the outset, they are “the smartest thinkers” asking “the toughest questions.”

0,"Alongside my disbelief, horror and sadness at the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, my main emotions are anger and frustration. Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable.

We’ve spoken many times about the roots of Covid-19 in the wildlife trade and the importance of investing in research into zoonotic diseases. It is no comfort to me now that the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) has been campaigning for much greater focus by governments and businesses on both these areas for many years.

Humanity’s relentless exploitation of wildlife has been putting us at increasing risk of an event like this for decades. And this knowledge has not been some big secret, despite the rhetoric from various world leaders claiming this pandemic couldn’t have been anticipated. The truth is, we knew this was coming. Not just scientists and conservationists. Even Hollywood knew this was coming; check out the movie billboards from 2011, advertising the film Contagion, which followed the rapid progress of a lethal virus that passes from a pig, infected by a bat, to humans in a Chinese live animal wet market.

Experts believe the Covid-19 virus spilled over from an animal host to a human in a wet market in Wuhan, China, sometime late last year. Perhaps the prime example of human overexploitation of wildlife, animals in these markets are taken from the wild, brought together from different places, transported over large distances and crammed together into cages. By this stage, they are stressed and immunosuppressed and so excrete whatever pathogens they have in them while also being increasingly vulnerable to infections they might not naturally encounter. People, who are in intimate contact with the body fluids of slaughtered animals, are also exposed to novel pathogens, creating the ideal environment for new diseases to emerge.

Closing the markets seems like one simple, quick decision. But that doesn’t account for the scores of people, often living in poverty, who rely on these types of markets for their sustenance, their income – their lives. Simply banning or closing wet markets where wildlife is sold would leave millions of people in the developing world without a vital source of nutrition. It can never be a long-term solution. But, unregulated – often illegal – wildlife trade exposes humanity to dangerous diseases like Covid-19, drives species to extinction, and funds organised crime.

In response to the coronavirus crisis, instead of knee-jerk bans that would be impossible to enforce and potentially drive trade underground, we need significant investment in wildlife health research, its application and improved regulation of wildlife markets. With investment, we can build a strong understanding of the risk factors associated with zoonotic disease emergence and how we can support communities to take action to prevent the horrendous impacts of these diseases they have experienced. Coming out of this crisis, we need to focus on recovery strategies that reduce zoonotic disease spill-over, better conserve nature and restore the valuable protection against diseases that ecosystems provide.

Battling the illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade has long been core to our field conservation and policy work, and bringing wild animal trafficking under control must be an international priority in the wake of coronavirus. Leading ZSL, I am confronted daily with the impact of the havoc being wrought on wildlife. The numbers scare me. Some 100 million sharks killed every year, mostly for their fins; 20,000 African elephants slaughtered annually for their ivory; more than 1,000 rhinos poached every year from South Africa alone since 2013. Take a longer view and you see the indiscriminate scale of the destruction; in ZSL’s Living Planet Index, we’ve tracked a 60 per cent decline in the size of wildlife populations since 1970. Today, one million species are threatened with extinction.

Trafficking isn’t just a problem for the rest of the world, nor one that doesn’t touch us here in the UK. Since 2000, we’ve provided homes at ZSL London Zoo for 3,370 animals confiscated by the UK’s Border Force, including Egyptian tortoises, red rain frogs, green tree pythons and hundreds of corals. We recently gave a home to Professor Lew, a critically endangered Chinese giant salamander smuggled into the UK in, of all things, a cereal box.

Wildlife health and human health go hand in hand. As this coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated – with tragic consequences – the way we interact with wildlife has ramifications for us all. As we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, with its enormous human and economic impacts, we must ensure there is a fundamental rethink of the relationship between humans and wildlife. We can’t let a temporary clearing of the smog over London, Delhi or Beijing, or a brief resurgence of wildlife in densely populated areas, be the only positives to emerge from global lockdown.

Part of what ZSL is about, now and after the lockdown, is helping to make sure that a return to business as usual in humanity’s relationship with nature, which got us here in the first place, is just not an option. We simply cannot afford to go back to old habits and old ways – for the sake of human health, of wildlife health and the future of our ecosystems.

Suspected to be the cause of the coronavirus pandemic, the pangolin is the most poached mammal on the planet. It is now at the heart of a vast, lucrative but illegal trade between Africa and Asia.

The pangolin, the most poached animal in the world, is one of the rare mammals that does not reproduce in captivity.

Located on the Strait of Malacca, not far from Kuala Lumpur, Port Kelang is Malaysia’s main port. And like the neighbouring city-state of Singapore, it is also a hub for pangolin traffic, a lucrative illegal trade linking Africa to Asia.

On 31 March, when the world was still wondering whether the small insectivore mammal had been the intermediate host for the coronavirus, Port Kelang customs officials seized a shipment of 6.2tn of scales valued at $17.9m. By May 2019, 5.3tn had been intercepted in Vietnam in two containers from Nigeria: the 151 bags of scales were mixed with about 60 bags of cashew nuts.

On the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) pangolin site, the grim litany of numbers prove that Asia is indeed the final destination of the traffic.

February 2019: 30tn of frozen animals seized in Malaysia.

April and July 2019: 25.6tn and 11.9tn seized in Singapore.

December 2019: 20.9tn seized in China.

Captured in 14 African countries

Where do the animals come from? According to a study published in the scientific journal Conservation Letters in 2017, between 500,000 and 2.7 million pangolins are captured each year in 14 African countries, including Cameroon, Central African Republic, Guinea, Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of Congo and Nigeria.

In fact, it is from the latter country that the vast majority of pangolins and their scales destined for Asian consumption originate. According to a report by the Wildlife Justice Commission (WJC) available online, of the 206.4tn seized during 52 customs interventions between 2016 and 2019, 113 were seized in Nigeria and 75 in Vietnam. According to the WJC, pangolin trafficking, which accounts for 20% of illegal mammal trafficking, links these two countries through the Strait of Malacca.

If this trade, which has been strictly banned since 2016, has increased in recent years, it is simply because the four Asian species of pangolin have been literally decimated. One of them is now classified as “endangered”, while the other three are “critically endangered”, including the Chinese pangolin. This leaves the four African species to satisfy the demand of Chinese or Vietnamese consumers.

On the Gabonese and Nigerian markets, prices are said to have increased since the 1990s. They have increased by a factor of 5.8 for the two terrestrial species (Smutsia gigantea and Smutsia temminckii) and by a factor of 2.3 for the arboreal species (Phataginus tricuspis and Phataginus tetradactyla).

According to IUCN, the pangolin is now the most poached mammal on the planet, both for its meat and for the virtues attributed to its scales in traditional pharmacopoeia – both in Africa and Asia.

Although discreet and rather nocturnal, this ant- and termite-loving animal has few non-human enemies: frightened, it rolls into a ball and relies on its scales to protect it from predators. For humans, it is then easy to pick it up and stuff it into a bag. Every five minutes on average, an animal is captured by poachers.

Moderate risk to poachers

The authorities in the countries concerned say they are doing their best to combat this trafficking. For example, on 3 March, in Abidjan, 3.5tn of scales were burned in order to discourage traffickers.

And as recently as 7 April, Zimbabwe’s The Herald reported that a certain Cleopas Dube, in possession of a pangolin that he intended to sell for some $1,000, had been sentenced to 620 hours of community service at Binga police station.

However, it is probably the weakness and rarity of the penalties imposed on offenders that allows this illegal trade to flourish.

In Nigeria, where mammals captured in neighbouring countries are probably centralised, poaching is punishable by a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a fine of N5m ($12,800). With the price of a kilo of scales and if one can find a sympathetic customs officer or judge, the risk remains moderate.

In Zimbabwe, the Tikki Hywood Foundation cares for and releases pangolins recovered by game wardens and conducts public-awareness campaigns. It has collaborated with the photographer Adrian Steirn and the jeweller Patrick Mavros. The sales of their works and their media coverage have benefited the animal’s cause.

For a time, the current COVID-19 pandemic and the initial investigation of the pangolin in the transmission of the coronavirus – now disputed by the scientific community – gave the impression that poaching might decrease. It would appear that this is not the case: China has indeed banned the sale and consumption of wild animals, but this is not the first time it has done so, or with convincing results.",Pangolin: The trail of the lucrative trade from Lagos to Kuala Lumpur,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFmcmljYXJlcG9ydC5jb20vMjY3MDYvcGFuZ29saW4tdGhlLXRyYWlsLW9mLXRoZS1sdWNyYXRpdmUtdHJhZGUtZnJvbS1sYWdvcy10by1rdWFsYS1sdW1wdXIv0gFvaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlYWZyaWNhcmVwb3J0LmNvbS8yNjcwNi9wYW5nb2xpbi10aGUtdHJhaWwtb2YtdGhlLWx1Y3JhdGl2ZS10cmFkZS1mcm9tLWxhZ29zLXRvLWt1YWxhLWx1bXB1ci9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.theafricareport.com/media/2020/04/SIPA_AP22097018_000004-e1587634796633.jpg,2020-04-23,"{'sent': 'Located on the Strait of Malacca, not far from Kuala Lumpur, Port Kelang is Malaysia’s main port.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Malaysia', 'Kuala Lumpur'], 'PERSON': ['Port Kelang']}}",Pangolin

On May 09, the world celebrated the World Migratory Bird Day in order to raise awareness of migratory birds and the importance of international cooperation to conserve them. For the year 2020 the theme is “Birds Connect our World”. It is organized by a collaborative partnership among two United Nations treaties i.e. the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS) and the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA), and the Colorado based non-profit organization, Environment for the Americas (EFTA).

Importance

Migratory Birds play an important role by conserving and restoring the ecological connectivity and integrity of ecosystems that support the natural cycles that are essential for the survival and well-being of migratory birds. Over the years, migratory birds are facing severe existential threat. Factors like loss of habitat, climate change, poisoning, power lines, and illegal killing have contributed immensely to the threat. It is realized that individual State effort wouldn’t bring desired results, however, sincere collective actions from all nation-states, across the world, has the potential to better protect migratory birds and the habitats they need to survive and thrive.

In this regard, CMS brings together the nation-states through which migratory animals pass, the Range States, and lays the legal foundation for internationally coordinated conservation measures throughout a migratory range. Migratory species threatened with extinction are listed on Appendix-Iand those migratory species that need or would significantly benefit from international co-operation are listed in Appendix-II of the Convention. Listing generally leads to concerted actions in different national jurisdictions in which a species range. Actions may include cooperation among range countries, harmonization in policies etc. through regional agreements. CMS has working groups specializing in various fauna families, and a scientific council that advises research-based solutions for conservation.

Endangered and Threatened Bird Species

At least 1,317 bird species have been recorded in India against around 10,000 species found worldwide. Of the 1,317 species recorded in India, 72 are endemic to the country. According to an assessment of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 2018, a total of 100 species of Indian birds are classified as ‘threatened’. Of these, 17 are categorized as ‘critically endangered’, 20 as ‘endangered’, and 63 as ‘vulnerable’.Besides these threatened species, there are several other species that are marked by sparse population size and restricted range and are generally considered rare by conservationists.

COP-13, India: Relevance

The conservation of wildlife and habitats has long been part of the cultural ethos of India.In February 2020the 13thsession of the Conference of the Partiesto the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals(COP-13) was held in Gandhinagar, India. The COP-13 had the theme titled “Migratory species connect the planet and together we welcome them home”. The COP-13resulted in the adoption of seven new species including migratory birds like Great Indian Bustard, Bengal Florican, Little Bustard, Antipodean Albatross to Appendix-I of the CMS. In this regard, the Government of India also issued a special stamp edition featuring the Great Indian Bustard as the mascot of COP-13.

COP-13 was the largest ever in the history of the Convention, with 2,550 people attending including 263 delegates representing 82 Parties, 11 delegates from 5 non-Party countries, 50 representatives from United Nations agencies, 70 representatives of international NGOs, 127 representatives of national NGOs and over 100 members of both national and international media.COP13 adopted the Gandhinagar Declaration, which calls for integration of migratory species and the concept of ‘ecological connectivity’ in the new framework (to be adopted at the United Nations Biodiversity Conference in October).Interestingly, COP-13 is perhaps the first COP ever inaugurated by the Head of Government of the host-country.

Convention on Migratory Species and its Agreements and MoUs

The CMS was initially signed by 21 nation-states in Bonn, Germany on 1979 and came into force in November, 1983. Presently, CMS has 130 nation-states as its Party while several other nation-states, although not Party to the CMS are Party to one or more of the agreements and/or have signed one or more of the Memorandum of Understandings (MoUs). The CMS was mainly drafted by Francoise Burhenne-Guilmin who later became head of IUCN’s Environmental Law Commission. CMS is species specific and covers terrestrial, marine and avian migratory species. According to Philippe Sands and Jacqueline Peel migratory species can be classified into four general categories; (1) Marine species which breed on the shores of coastal states but migrate to sea during adult life, e.g. seals, sea turtles, anadromous fish; (2) Highly migratory marine species which travel between exclusive economic zones and high seas e.g. tuna or whales; (3) Territorial species with a well-established migration pattern e.g. birds; and (4) Territorial or marine species which live in border areas and regularly cross jurisdiction boundaries e.g. gorillas or elephants.

Interestingly, however, the CMS itself does not apply any direct measures, but directs the “range states” to make ancillary agreements. So far six regional agreements and seven non-binding MoUs have been convened on various migratory species, like AEWA, 1995whichis an intergovernmental treaty dedicated to the conservation of migratory water birds including 255 species of birds ecologically dependent on wetlands for at least part of their annual cycle and their habitats across Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia, Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago. Likewise, the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP), 2001 was made to recognize the need for international cooperation for marine migratory species like Albatrosses and Petrels.

Similarly, the MoU concerning conservation measures for the Siberian Crane, 1993 was entered to protect Siberian Cranes. The MoU concerning conservation measures for the Slender-Billed Curlew, 1994 was formed with an aim to safeguard the Slender-Billed Curlew. The MoU on the conservation and management of the Great Bustard, 2001 was also made to correct the continuous decline of the Great Bustard and degradation or fragmentation of suitable habitats and hunting pressure in Middle-European States etc.

Migratory Bird Treaties:From 1916 onwards

Prior to the multilateral international conventions, migratory bird treaties (MBTs) were main instruments for bird protection. The United States of America(USA) is pioneer in entering into the treaty regime of ‘nation-state conservation policy’. Perhaps, the thought was to successfully strengthen the domestic laws and thereafter facilitate the international cooperation for avian conservation. The 1916,The United States signs a treaty with Great Britain (acting on behalf of Canada, then part of the British Empire)to stop all hunting of insectivorous birds and to establish specific hunting seasons for game birds. In order to implement the treaty, the USA Congress passed the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, 1918 and replaced the Weeks-McLean Act, 1913.The said treaty is known to be one of the oldest sources of international environmental law.Later, USA signed a treaty similar to the one entered between Great Britain with Mexico in 1936 for the protection (through laws and regulations) of migratory birds in their movements across the two signatory nation-states.USA signed treaty with Japan in 1972 for protection of migratory birds except if an open season has been established. Likewise, USA entered treaty with Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1976 to improve cooperation between the contracting parties as the conservation of migratory birds passing between their territories.

The success of MBTs to facilitate, encourage, and justify expensive and often low-priority bird conservation and research facilities rubbed onto other nation-states. For instance, Japan in 1973 signed a treaty with USSR to promote cooperation in the conservation of birds migrating between the contracting parties’ territories and of endangered species of birds. In 1974, Australia signed an identical treaty (the one entered between Japan and USSR) with Japan. In 1981, Japan entered an agreement with Peoples Republic of China (PRC) for the prohibition of the taking of birds listed in an appendix to the treaty, establishment of bird sanctuaries, and for the exchange of research results. This bilateral migratory bird agreement has been instrumental in building research capacity in PRC for the study of migratory birds.

There are certain little known yet significant MBTs, for example, the 1984 agreement between India and USSR, which is applicable to species of birds for which there is a positive evidence of migration between the two countries and also to species or sub-species common to both countries and listed in the appendix attached with the agreement. Both nations agreed to promote joint research programs and establish bird sanctuaries and endeavour to preserve and improve the natural environment of migratory birds. Another, treaty entered between Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation in 1994 (is the only bilateral treaty entered in 1990s)was on mutual cooperation for taking measures for the management and protection of migratory birds and their habitat and the prevention of the extinction of certain birds. It recognized that many species of birds migrate between and seasonally live in both countries and that certain species of birds are in danger of extinction.

Though, the merits of MBTs are mostly limited to migratory bird species and is limited between the nation-states party to such treaties. Nevertheless, from the perusal of above-discussed MBTs, it is argued that MBTs are still a beneficial tool since multinational treaties tend to be inflexible, cumbersome, and politically driven. They act as a useful tool for international wildlife conservation (even after the emergence of multinational treaties like CMS). At the same time, it would be much too simplistic to conclude that any one category or model of MBT is better than any other, In fact MBTs have starting to form a network of international conservation efforts.

Concluding remarks

The last flocks of passenger pigeons were reported in 1888, the last confirmed sighting occurred in 1900, and the last passenger pigeon died in captivity in 1914 in Cincinnati zoo.In 1850 Alexander Wilson, an ornithol­ogist,watched migrating flock of passenger pigeons and wrote that their passing had darkened the sky for more than 30 minutes(containing 2 billion birds spread over 384 km long and 1.6 km wide, in the sky). Both passenger pigeon (Ectopistes migratorius) and Dodo (Raphus cucullatus) were most dramatic bird extinction ever recorded. Both were the victim of human consumption. Even thereafter, the human desire did not stop, birds which were frequently around 10 years ago, have become rare and in certain cases extinct. In the times, when most of the world’s population is under some form of restricted movement due to the COVID-19, this theme “Birds Connect Our World” carries a particular relevance and poignance. The need of hour is multiple efforts, for instance, during recently concluded COP-13, the Indian Prime Minister pledged to focus on the conservation of migratory birds along the Central Asian Flyway, announced the establishment of an institutional research facility for the conservation of migratory birds and marine turtles, and confirmed efforts to reduce pollution from micro-plastic and single-use plastic etc. It is desired that human-beings collectively act to prevent the destruction of birds. This would demand adherence of stringent domestic laws, and measures that conserve and protect their habitats and their flyways.

0,"CHANGSHA: As an environmental protection volunteer at the Changsha Wildlife Conservation Association (CSWCA), central China's Hunan Province, Zhou Canying has long been engaged in the protection of the Chinese pangolin.



""Finally! A surprise encounter with a Chinese pangolin!"" Zhou recently shared with Chinese wildlife conservationists an exhilarating message on her social media account.



This is the first time that she and her team have captured footage of a Chinese pangolin in the wild, an unexpected breakthrough for the association since its launch of a program to search for the last pangolins five years ago.



Pangolins are illegally traded mammal in the world. According to data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Species Survival Commission (SSC) Pangolin Specialist Group, more than 1 million pangolins were poached worldwide from 2004 to 2014 alone.



In 2016, the CSWCA launched the ""Search for the Last Pangolins"" program as a preparatory effort for the in situ conservation of the species. For conservationists, the first thing about pangolin protection is to determine their population, whereabouts, habitat requirements and what causes them to be endangered.



The programme has been launched mainly in the vast hilly regions south of the Yangtze River, home to the Chinese pangolin, an ancient species which has lived for more than 80 million years.



Two years ago, Zhou noticed online reports of a baby Chinese pangolin found in a residential area in a county of east China's Jiangxi Province and later sent into the wild. The limited information was precious enough to send her and her team on an immediate research journey to the reported place.



Pangolins are nocturnal animals that only come out of their caves at night for food and are rarely spotted in the wild due to their scarce population. To judge whether pangolins exist locally and to observe their living conditions, it is advisable to film them with infrared camera traps.



Zhou cooperated with the wildlife conservationists there and designated a place in a local nature reserve to install cameras based on clues such as field studies, caves and traces.



""We have searched for pangolins in many southern provinces, but all in vain. This time, our efforts finally paid off,"" Zhou said.



Footage of a video released by the CSWCA on April 26 showed a pangolin, big-tailed and slightly stooped, trekking nimbly under the bushes. The video was shot in the city of Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, where Zhou and her team often went to search for pangolins.



The animal captured in the footage was further identified and confirmed by Wu Shibao and several other experts as a Chinese pangolin.



This was in fact just one example of the recent discoveries across China of Chinese pangolins. It was reported that infrared cameras had also captured footage of wild Chinese pangolins in a nature reserve in the Xianju National Park in east China's Zhejiang Province, and that two teachers came across a walking Chinese pangolin in a school playground and sent it into the forest in east China's Fujian Province.



Wildlife conservationists believe that the frequent appearances of Chinese pangolins recently indicate that the species is not functionally extinct.



Wu said that in recent years, pangolins have been spotted in the wild in the provinces of Guangdong, Hainan, Anhui, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Yunnan and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, including cubs weighing less than two kg and younger than one year old, indicating that Chinese pangolins can still reproduce naturally, and if earnestly protected, their population can gradually recover.



""The discovery of the Chinese pangolin is just the beginning toward a fundamental improvement of the species' habitats,"" Zhou said. - Xinhua/Asian News Network

0,"Human activity is putting more than 50 billion years of unique evolutionary history at risk, scientists have said.

Researchers have warned some of the world’s most unique animals, such as the punk-haired Mary River turtle and the purple frog, are in danger of becoming extinct due to “unprecedented levels of human pressure” brought on by activities such as agricultural expansion.

The findings, published in the journal Nature Communications, are based on data gathered from 25,000 species, which assessed the extinction risk of terrestrial creatures such as amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles.

The experts are calling for urgent action to protect one-of-a-kind animals, which are classed as evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered (Edge) species.

Dr James Rosindell, from Imperial College London, who is one of the study authors, said: “Our findings highlight the importance of acting urgently to conserve these extraordinary species and the remaining habitat that they occupy – in the face of intense human pressures.”

The purple frog can be seen in the Western Ghats of India (Sandeep Das/ZSL)

A team of international researchers, which included experts from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Imperial College London and University of Oxford, looked at regions around the world with large concentrations of Edge species.

They found that many areas home to unique evolutionary history – such as the Caribbean, the Western Ghats of India, and large parts of south-east Asia – had “unprecedented levels” of human activity.

According to the researchers, the findings showed at least 50 billion collective years of evolutionary heritage to be under threat, almost four times longer than the age of the universe.

Lead author Rikki Gumbs, of Imperial College London, said: “Our analyses reveal the incomprehensible scale of the losses we face if we don’t work harder to save global biodiversity – to put some of the numbers into perspective, reptiles alone stand to lose at least 13 billion years of unique evolutionary history, roughly the same number of years as have passed since the beginning of the entire universe.”

Animals that are closely related, such as pangolins and tapirs, would be at greater risk of extinction, the researchers said, along with Edge species such as the Mary River turtle, named for the Mary River in Queensland, Australia, and the purple frog, found in the Western Ghats.

Other unique species such as the yellow-eyed nocturnal Aye-Aye lemur native to Madagascar, Chinese crocodile lizard, and the Shoebill – a large bird found in Africa’s swamps and wetlands – could be also be lost to extinction, they added.

Mr Gumbs said: “These are some of the most incredible and overlooked animals on Planet Earth.

“From legless lizards and tiny blind snakes to pink worm-like amphibians called caecilians, we know precious little about these fascinating creatures, many of which may be sliding silently toward extinction.”",Human activity ‘threatens 50 billion of years of evolutionary history',https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pcmlzaG5ld3MuY29tL21hZ2F6aW5lL3NjaWVuY2UvMjAyMC8wNS8yNi9uZXdzL2h1bWFuLWFjdGl2aXR5LXRocmVhdGVucy01MC1iaWxsaW9uLW9mLXllYXJzLW9mLWV2b2x1dGlvbmFyeS1oaXN0b3J5LS0xOTUyODYwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.irishnews.com/picturesarchive/irishnews/irishnews/2020/05/26/131012170-9f0ce24c-b1a8-4e7f-9058-601ded92c064.jpg,2020-05-26,"{'sent': 'Human activity is putting more than 50 billion years of unique evolutionary history at risk, scientists have said.\n\n', 'ents': {'MONEY': ['more than 50 billion years']}}",Pangolin

Many of these unique species live in areas that are facing unprecedented levels of human pressure from activities such as urban development, deforestation and road building, including the Caribbean, the Western Ghats of India, and large parts of Southeast Asia.

The team mapped the evolutionary history – how a species has evolved over time and which other species it is closely related to – of the world’s amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles.

Because many species evolved side by side on separate branches of the evolutionary tree, the amount of cumulative evolutionary history represented by each group of animals can be incredibly large. For example, reptiles alone contain about 13 billion years of evolutionary history, which is about the age of the Universe.

In total, the team calculated that at least 50 billion years of evolutionary history is under threat across the animal group studied, and that this is likely to be an underestimate, as there are many species we don’t know enough about.

Incomprehensible scale of losses

Lead author Rikki Gumbs, of ZSL’s EDGE of Existence programme and the Science and Solutions for a Changing Planet Doctoral Training Partnership at Imperial College London, said: “Our analyses reveal the incomprehensible scale of the losses we face if we don’t work harder to save global biodiversity.”

Some of the greatest losses of evolutionary history will be driven by the extinction of entire groups of closely related species that share long branches of the tree of life, such as pangolins and tapirs, which also perform vital functions like seed dispersal and pest control in their local ecosystems.

Much of the loss will also be made up of highly evolutionarily distinct species that sit alone at the ends of extremely long branches, such as the ancient Chinese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus crocodilurus), the shoebill bird (Balaeniceps rex), and the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), a nocturnal lemur with large yellow eyes and long spindly fingers.

This new study highlights priority species for conservation, based on their evolutionary uniqueness and the intense human pressure across the environments where they are thought to live. Many of these species are also a priority for ZSL’s EDGE of Existence programme, which works to conserve the world’s most evolutionarily distinct and threatened species from extinction.

Several weird and wonderful EDGE Species in the new study are urgent conservation priorities – including the punk-haired Mary River turtle (Elusor macrurus), the purple frog (Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis), and the numbat (Myrmecobius fasciatus).

Gumbs added: “These are some of the most incredible and overlooked animals on Planet Earth. From legless lizards and tiny blind snakes to pink worm-like amphibians called caecilians, we know precious little about these fascinating creatures, many of which may be sliding silently toward extinction.”

Incredible and overlooked animals

The study also highlights many lesser known species as priorities for further research, with more than half of the priority lizards and snakes identified currently lacking adequate extinction risk data.

Jointly led by ZSL and Imperial College London – with the University of Oxford, Yale University, Tel Aviv University, Ben-Gurion University and On The EDGE Conservation – the study also identifies regions where concentrations of irreplaceable diversity are currently under little to no human pressure, particularly across the Amazon rainforest, the highlands of Borneo, and parts of southern Africa.

Dr Rosindell said: “Our findings highlight the importance of acting urgently to conserve these extraordinary species and the remaining habitat that they occupy in the face of intense human pressures.”
