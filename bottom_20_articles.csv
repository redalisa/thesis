The wetlands where the stork nested had been irrigated, and development damaged its habitat. But in a remarkable success story, the storks are thriving again after a reintroduction programme.

After more than three decades of extinction, the first captive storks were released into the wild in 2005. By 2007 the first chick had hatched, and this year a further nine chicks arrived.

Yoshito Ohsako, who heads the breeding programme at Toyooka, said: ""We were so happy when we found the nests. It's not so long since we started, and this is real progress; a lot of people didn't even think we'd succeed at all.""

Japan was forced to do the unthinkable: it had to go back in time. Aggressive development had driven the birds to extinction, so the only option left was to attempt to return the ecosystem to its pre-1971 state.

The Hyogo district – once the birds' heartland – bore the scars of heavy industrialisation and modern farming. Land that was not polluted or developed was used for farming, so the paddyfields which had once supplied plentiful food for fish, frogs and snakes dried up and became contaminated with pesticides.

To make this landscape hospitable again has meant going back to more traditional irrigation systems that allow rivers and ditches to flow into paddyfields. This creates pools of shallow stagnant water that encourage the ecosystem that the birds can feed on.

Cutting pesticides and using more traditional cultivation methods has also helped make the wetlands less toxic. Some electricity cables have been put underground to stop the birds flying into them.

Professor Ohsako said: ""The connections between the paddyfields and the streams and ditches disappeared. In our project we reinstated the aquatic connection to create 'fish ways', that channelled fish to shallow water.""

The total number of oriental white storks in the world is believed to be as low as 2,500, with most in China, Korea and Russia.

The renaissance of the birds comes as biodiversity takes centre stage in global politics. Biodiversity will be high on the agenda today when environment ministers gather for pre-G8 summit talks in Kobe.

Yuri Onodera, of Friends of the Earth Japan, said that while such reintroduction schemes were laudable, Japan lacked commitment to biodiversity on a global scale. ""Japan may be putting energy into conserving its own domestic landscapes, but its commitment internationally is failing,"" said Mr Onodera.

""It has been a strong opponent of a binding commitment to global biodiversity; its domestic commitment has little impact while they are lagging behind on international commitment.""",Japan turns back clock to give new life to lost storks,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGVwZW5kZW50LmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYXNpYS9qYXBhbi10dXJucy1iYWNrLWNsb2NrLXRvLWdpdmUtbmV3LWxpZmUtdG8tbG9zdC1zdG9ya3MtODMzNTk2Lmh0bWzSAXRodHRwczovL3d3dy5pbmRlcGVuZGVudC5jby51ay9uZXdzL3dvcmxkL2FzaWEvamFwYW4tdHVybnMtYmFjay1jbG9jay10by1naXZlLW5ldy1saWZlLXRvLWxvc3Qtc3RvcmtzLTgzMzU5Ni5odG1sP2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2008/05/24/00/29413.bin,2008-05-24,"{'sent': ""When Japan's last oriental white stork died in 1971 it was thought that the birds had disappeared forever."", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Japan']}}","When Japan's last oriental white stork died in 1971 it was thought that the birds had disappeared forever.

It's the Twelve Days of Christmas - and just about everyone gets a festive roasting.

The traditional carol has been updated by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy - with a biting twist in every verse.

Carol Ann, 53, the Mirror's poetry editor, attacks greedy bankers, MPs and TV celebs.

Radio Times editor Ben Preston, who commissioned the poem said: ""It's trenchant but humorous.""

The Poet Laureate, a job nearly 400 years old, was originally appointed to pen odes to flatter royalty.

1 On the first day of Christmas, a buzzard on a branch.

In Afghanistan, no partridge, pear tree; but my true love sent to me a card from home.

I sat alone, crouched in yellow dust, and traced the grins of my kids with my thumb.

Somewhere down the line, for another father, husband, brother, son, a bullet with his name on.

2 Two turtle doves, that Shakespeare loved - turr turr, turr turr - endangered now by herbicide, the chopping down of where they hide - turr turr, turr turr - hawthorn thickets, hedgerows, woodland. Summer's music fainter, farther... the spreading drought of the Sahara.

3 Three French hens - un, deux, trois - do not know that French they are.

Three Welsh lambs - un, dau, tri - do not know that Welsh they baa.

Newborn babies - one, two, three - only know you human be. Only know you human be.

4 The Grenada Dove is calling.

The Condor calls from the USA.

The Wood Stork calls from its wetlands.

The Albatross calls from the sea, on the fourth day of Christmas.

The Yellow-eared Parrot is calling. The Kakapo calls from NZ.

The Blue-throated Macaw is calling.

The Little Tern calls from Japan, calls my true love sent to me.

The Corncrake is calling; the Osprey.

The Baikal Teal calls from Korea.

The Cuckoo is calling from England, four calling birds.

5 The first gold ring was gold indeed - bankers' profits fired in greed.

The second ring outshone the sun, fuelled by carbon, doused by none. Ring three was black gold, O for oil - a serpent swallowing its tail.

The fourth ring was Celebrity; Fool's Gold, winking on TV.

Ring five, religion's halo, slipped - a blind for eyes or gag for lips.

With these five gold rings they you wed, then slip them off when you are dead.

With these five go-o-o-old rings.

6 I bought a magic goose from a jolly farmer. This goose laid Barack Obama.

I bought a magic goose from a friendly fellow. This goose laid Fabio Capello.

I bought a magic goose from a maiden (comely). This goose laid Joanna Lumley.

I bought a magic goose from a busker (poor). This goose laid Anish Kapoor.

I bought a magic goose from a bargain bin, it was the goose laid Alan Bennett.

I bought a poisoned goose from a crook (sick, whiffing). This foul goose laid Nick Griffin.

7 The Swan at Cockermouth - of a broken heart, one half.

The Mersey Swans, flying for Hillsborough, wings of justice.

Two, married and mute on the Thames, watching The Wave.

A Swan for Adrian Mitchell and a Swan for UA Fanthorpe, swansongs for poetry.

The Queen's birds, paired for life, beauty and truth.

8 One milked money to mend her moat.

Two milked voters to float her boat.

Three milked Parliament to flip her flat.

Four milked Government to snip her cat.

Five milked the dead for close-up tears.

Six milked the tax-payer for years and years and years...

Seven milked the system to Botox her brow.

Eight milked herself - the selfish cow.

9 But the dead soldier's lady does not dance.

But the honour killing lady does not dance. But the drowned policeman's lady does not dance.

But the lady in the filthy hospital ward does not dance.

Marilyn sez, ""Bryan Christy writes in the Jan issue of National Geographic about a notorious animal smuggler.

But he got out of prison in 47 months, during which time his wife kept the business going full force. And when Wong got out of prison he set his sights on a 'new wildlife venture, a zoo that promises to be his most audacious enterprise yet' -- smuggling tigers. Christy tells the story of how the Fish & Wildlife Special Ops team set up a sting operation to capture Wong, who boasted of having horns of Sumatran and Javanese rhinoceroses, both forbidden Appendix I animals. He talked openly about getting shahtoosh, the 'king of wool,' from the Tibetan antelope. He had access to extraordinary birds, including the Rothschild's mynah, whose wild population was estimated to number fewer than 150. He bragged about his Spix's macaws, a bird now believed to be extinct in the wild, claiming he'd recently sold three. The black market rate for a Spix's macaw was $100,000.

While no one knows exactly how large the illegal wildlife trade is, this much is certain: It's extraordinarily lucrative. Profit margins are the kind drug kingpins would kill for. Smugglers evade detection by hiding illegal wildlife in legal shipments, they bribe wildlife and customs officials, and they alter trade documents. Few are ever caught, and penalties are usually no more severe than a parking ticket. Wildlife trafficking may very well be the world's most profitable form of illegal trade, bar none.

Environment correspondent, BBC News

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement As we pull into Toyohira, an unusual and unexpected welcome committee is lined up ready to receive us. The group of primary-age children breaks into a song about the bonds of friendship between human and salamander. ""It's everyone's friend,"" they warble through the chilled afternoon air. Compared to 40 years ago when we started the research, I feel that numbers are down by around half

Dr Kazushi Kuwabara

Asa Zoological Park, Hiroshima ""Let's be friends forever."" A small river burbles its accompaniment - a river flowing past their school, which contains along its length a number of concrete structures designed to make sure the Japanese giant salamanders, or hanzaki, are still around by the time the next generation of children stands in the same spot and sings the same song. The ""hanzaki holes"" are a key conservation tool in a land where many rivers are now sculpted not by nature, but by the hand of man. When I ask Professor Masafumi Matsui from Kyoto University, a leading Japanese authority on all matters amphibian, to name the single biggest modern threat to this animal that has been around roughly unchanged since the time of the dinosaurs, he answers without demur: ""The construction of dams and roads, which destroys the habitats"". ""We can't do without constructing such things; and [the habitat] will be cut upstream and downstream."" Children sing of a strong bond between human and salamander

Many Japanese rivers are now, in reality, canals - boxed in concrete, guided down valleys to keep floodwaters away from homes and secure a supply to the irrigation systems. To breed, hanzaki need to find nesting dens in the riverbanks. Without dens, there will be no more hanzaki; hence the holes. And while the idea of a concrete nest might not seem very appealing to the human constitution, the salamanders themselves seem OK with it. Canal dreams Lifting the lid on one of the dens, we see the rear half of a big, mature male. Its head is poking through a small connecting tunnel into the river, where it can protect the nest from any would-be usurpers. The breeding plan appears to be working; along the river we can find larvae just a few months old, and presumably some at least have sprung from these nests.

'Living fossil': A close encounter But is this real conservation? Is keeping the species alive with such a surgical strike a valid substitute for the much wider restoration of these concreted channels that would also help everything else in the ecosystem? ""Obviously in these kinds of managed landscapes you do need to do some management, and what they've been doing here in these artificial nests and so forth is a tremendous management approach,"" says Claude Gascon, an amphibian specialist with Conservation International. ""But obviously that's not sufficient, and you do need to protect some of these natural habitats, these watersheds, in their natural form so that you're protecting all of the needs of this animal, which is a tremendous animal."" Hunting ban Move a curious finger down the Red List of Threatened Species, and the factor you see more often than any other as a cause of decline for just about every kind of creature - amphibians, birds, mammals - is precisely what is facing the Japanese giant salamander: loss of habitat. Its sister species in China, by contrast, must contend most urgently with the wiles of poachers - hardly surprising, when the meat from an adult giant salamander can fetch upwards of $1,000 on the black market. Masafumi Matsui finds salamanders - but few are pure Japanese Hunting has brought the Chinese giant salamander to the unwelcome status of Critically Endangered. In former times, the Japanese salamander was hunted too. After protection was conferred in the 1950s, some bright spark had the idea of importing the Chinese species, farming it, and supplying the meat demand that way. In the inevitable way of these things, the idea quickly proved a busted flush. But the Chinese animals escaped; and though the farm itself is long gone, the once farmed salamanders are thriving. With Masafumi Matsui and his team of assistants - one sporting the perhaps inevitable soubriquet of ""ninja turtle"" - we clamber out into the bed of the Kamo river as it hurries down a narrow valley between wooded slopes. They find one larva, small and black - then two, then three - and finally a roseate miniature of the real thing, several years old. Without DNA analysis it is impossible to be sure, but the professor is pretty sure this is a hybrid. ""Last year, more than 50% were hybrids,"" he says. Back in his lab at Kyoto University, he demonstrates the extra aggressiveness of the Chinese species. With a fish dangled in front of its nose, it turns in a flash from dopey sloth to snapping tiger. The aggressiveness is helping the Chinese males take over the dens of the local rivers - and with the dens, the right to breed. The Japanese giant salamander may soon be extinct as a separate species in these waters. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement With the hanzaki under threat from habitat destruction, with invasive species threatening in some areas and with climate change and disease lingering as other possible threats on the horizon, a number of institutions have set up captive breeding programmes. In a compound at Hiroshima's Asa Zoological Park, Hidekazu Ashikaga shows us how it works. An ""artificial river"" flows between artificial nests just like the ones in Toyohira, filled with the back ends of dominant males. At breeding time, the salamanders do their thing and little salamanders emerge from the fertilised egg mass, just as in the wild.

Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement As we pull into Toyohira, an unusual and unexpected welcome committee is lined up ready to receive us. The group of primary-age children breaks into a song about the bonds of friendship between human and salamander. ""It's everyone's friend,"" they warble through the chilled afternoon air. Compared to 40 years ago when we started the research, I feel that numbers are down by around half

Dr Kazushi Kuwabara

Asa Zoological Park, Hiroshima ""Let's be friends forever."" A small river burbles its accompaniment - a river flowing past their school, which contains along its length a number of concrete structures designed to make sure the Japanese giant salamanders, or hanzaki, are still around by the time the next generation of children stands in the same spot and sings the same song. The ""hanzaki holes"" are a key conservation tool in a land where many rivers are now sculpted not by nature, but by the hand of man. When I ask Professor Masafumi Matsui from Kyoto University, a leading Japanese authority on all matters amphibian, to name the single biggest modern threat to this animal that has been around roughly unchanged since the time of the dinosaurs, he answers without demur: ""The construction of dams and roads, which destroys the habitats"". ""We can't do without constructing such things; and [the habitat] will be cut upstream and downstream."" Children sing of a strong bond between human and salamander

Many Japanese rivers are now, in reality, canals - boxed in concrete, guided down valleys to keep floodwaters away from homes and secure a supply to the irrigation systems. To breed, hanzaki need to find nesting dens in the riverbanks. Without dens, there will be no more hanzaki; hence the holes. And while the idea of a concrete nest might not seem very appealing to the human constitution, the salamanders themselves seem OK with it. Canal dreams Lifting the lid on one of the dens, we see the rear half of a big, mature male. Its head is poking through a small connecting tunnel into the river, where it can protect the nest from any would-be usurpers. The breeding plan appears to be working; along the river we can find larvae just a few months old, and presumably some at least have sprung from these nests.

'Living fossil': A close encounter But is this real conservation? Is keeping the species alive with such a surgical strike a valid substitute for the much wider restoration of these concreted channels that would also help everything else in the ecosystem? ""Obviously in these kinds of managed landscapes you do need to do some management, and what they've been doing here in these artificial nests and so forth is a tremendous management approach,"" says Claude Gascon, an amphibian specialist with Conservation International. ""But obviously that's not sufficient, and you do need to protect some of these natural habitats, these watersheds, in their natural form so that you're protecting all of the needs of this animal, which is a tremendous animal."" Hunting ban Move a curious finger down the Red List of Threatened Species, and the factor you see more often than any other as a cause of decline for just about every kind of creature - amphibians, birds, mammals - is precisely what is facing the Japanese giant salamander: loss of habitat. Its sister species in China, by contrast, must contend most urgently with the wiles of poachers - hardly surprising, when the meat from an adult giant salamander can fetch upwards of $1,000 on the black market. Masafumi Matsui finds salamanders - but few are pure Japanese Hunting has brought the Chinese giant salamander to the unwelcome status of Critically Endangered. In former times, the Japanese salamander was hunted too. After protection was conferred in the 1950s, some bright spark had the idea of importing the Chinese species, farming it, and supplying the meat demand that way. In the inevitable way of these things, the idea quickly proved a busted flush. But the Chinese animals escaped; and though the farm itself is long gone, the once farmed salamanders are thriving. With Masafumi Matsui and his team of assistants - one sporting the perhaps inevitable soubriquet of ""ninja turtle"" - we clamber out into the bed of the Kamo river as it hurries down a narrow valley between wooded slopes. They find one larva, small and black - then two, then three - and finally a roseate miniature of the real thing, several years old. Without DNA analysis it is impossible to be sure, but the professor is pretty sure this is a hybrid. ""Last year, more than 50% were hybrids,"" he says. Back in his lab at Kyoto University, he demonstrates the extra aggressiveness of the Chinese species. With a fish dangled in front of its nose, it turns in a flash from dopey sloth to snapping tiger. The aggressiveness is helping the Chinese males take over the dens of the local rivers - and with the dens, the right to breed. The Japanese giant salamander may soon be extinct as a separate species in these waters. Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement With the hanzaki under threat from habitat destruction, with invasive species threatening in some areas and with climate change and disease lingering as other possible threats on the horizon, a number of institutions have set up captive breeding programmes. In a compound at Hiroshima's Asa Zoological Park, Hidekazu Ashikaga shows us how it works. An ""artificial river"" flows between artificial nests just like the ones in Toyohira, filled with the back ends of dominant males. At breeding time, the salamanders do their thing and little salamanders emerge from the fertilised egg mass, just as in the wild. The offspring are kept in a sequence of caskets, lined up with military precision, each labelled with the year in which its occupants hatched. Recently, the facility saw the first emergence documented anywhere in the world of third-generation captive - animals whose parents and grandparents had been bred in captivity.

An artist's impression of the rarely seen and now extinct Alaotra grebe

The Alaotra grebe is extinct, according to the latest assessment of the world's rarest birds.

The last known sighting of the bird was in 1985 and experts have now confirmed its demise, killed off by a combination of poaching and predatory fish.

The Malagasy species, which lived in Lake Alaotra, is the first confirmed bird extinction since 2008.

However, fortunes have improved for rare birds such as the Azores bullfinch and Colombian yellow-eared parrot.

No escape

The Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus) was a medium-sized bird with small wings that inhabited Lake Alaotra and surrounding areas in Madagascar.

Due to its tiny wings, the bird was thought incapable of flying long distances, living a mainly sedentary lifestyle on the lake and in surrounding ponds and highland lakes.

The only known photo of an Alaotra grebe

Twelve Alaotran grebes were sighted at Lake Alaotra in December 1982, and two near Andreba on Lake Alaotra in September 1985.

Some birds with characteristics of the grebe were seen in 1985, 1986 and 1988, but these are thought to be hybrids with another grebe species.

Surveys in 1999 and a visit by experts in 2000 found no individuals, or any grebes belong to the same genus Tachybaptus.

No direct observations of the species have been made since and hopes that the bird might survive were dashed after a recent expedition to nearby Lake Amparihinandriamabavy failed to find any grebes.

Officials have now declared the bird extinct in the latest update to the IUCN Red List of endangered and threatened birds.

The Red List, regarded as the most authoritative assessment of the state of the planet's species, draws on the work of scientists around the globe.

""No hope now remains for this species. It is another example of how human actions can have unforeseen consequences,"" says Dr Leon Bennun of Birdlife International, which evaluates the status of rare birds for the IUCN Red List.

The grebe is thought to have been driven to extinction by a combination of factors.

The bird, usually found in pairs, fed almost exclusively on fish in Lake Alaotra, a large brackish lake which had shores once covered in dense papyrus and reeds.

But in recent years, fishermen have covered much of the lake with monofilament nylon gill-nets which can kill diving waterbirds.

These nets were introduced after the grebe had already significantly declined, though they may have killed remaining birds.

Carnivorous fish (Micropterus and Ophiocephalus) introduced into the lake are also thought to have significantly contributed to the grebe's extinction, while the introduction of other invasive mammals, fish and plants likely depleted the grebe's food sources.

Azores bullfinches are faring better

Poaching also reduced its numbers.

Knowing exactly when a species has gone extinct is extremely difficult, as records of sightings can be patchy or unsubstantiated.

Also, comprehensive surveys must be completed to ensure a species does not survive in previously unexplored habitats.

For those reasons, species are often declared extinct many years after they have last been seen.

The last bird species to be confirmed extinct is the Liverpool pigeon (Caloenas maculata), declared extinct in 2008.

However, this Pacific species is known from just two specimens, one of which has been lost. It likely went extinct before Europeans colonised the Pacific.

In 2005, the Thick-billed Ground-dove (Gallicolumba salamonis) was declared extinct, it too known from two specimens, the last caught in 1927.

Other birds declared extinct in the 21st Century include the Hawkins's Rail (Diaphorapteryx hawkinsi), Reunion Shelduck (Alopochen kervazoi) and Kamao (Myadestes myadestinus) among others.

Modern species thought to be extinct, but not yet confirmed, include the Po'ouli (Melamprosops phaeosoma).

The last known survivor of this honeycreeper species died in captivity in 2004, despite huge efforts to rescue it.

Surveys have yet to be done to confirm it no longer survives on the remote highland slopes of Hawaii.

Another species suffering from the impacts of invasive species is the Zapata Rail (Cyanolimnas cerverai) from Cuba.

Yellow-eared parrots have been downgraded

It has been updated to ""Critically Endangered"" on the latest Red List, under threat from introduced mongooses and exotic catfish.

Only one nest has ever been found of this species.

However the new Red List does highlight some conservation success stories.

The Azores bullfinch (Pyrrhula murina) has been downlisted from ""Critically Endangered"" to ""Endangered"" after efforts to restore its habitat.

In Colombia, the Yellow-eared parrot (Ognorrhynchus icterotis) has also benefited from protection of its nest sites and education programmes, leading to its status being downgraded to ""Endangered"".

0,"When I grew up in Mazatlán, I'd hear people say, it's better to live five years rich than a lifetime poor,"" I was told by Daniel, who is studying law at a university in Mexico City. ""Sometimes it would even be written on walls.""

In a different context this phrase might be promoting righteous work for personal progress. But since we were talking about the drug cartels in Mexico, I knew the meaning was shady — it is a justification for what decent men resort to while dancing to the seductive song of the drug trade.

As the drug war escalates, more civilians are caught in the crossfire. There have been innocent bystanders for decades, far from the gun battles in cities: the damage of drug production to the land, water and air. The environment has been the forgotten victim, raped and pillaged without notice.

Inland from Mazatlán and spanning several states is the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, one of the most ecologically diverse areas in North America. Mountain peaks up to 9,000 feet and deep valleys like the Copper Canyon set geographical limits for many temperate and tropical species — eagles and hawks soar above pine forests, green parakeets and boa constrictors roam the canyons.

The area has 200 species of oak trees and is world-renown for its endemic bird species such as the thick-billed parrot, which is in danger of extinction. Largely due to deforestation from logging and drug production, only 2 percent, or 300,000 acres, of old growth forest remain.

Map of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range. Click to enlarge.

From the coastal state of Sinaloa to the border state of Chihuahua, the warm sunshine and mild winters of the Sierra Madre Occidental make it incredibly productive for drug cultivation. Its vast stretches of unpatrolled wilderness and direct distribution corridor into the U.S. (via Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) have made the Sierra Madre Occidental one of the world's largest drug-producing regions for marijuana and opium.

Drug production is adding fuel to the destruction of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Deforestation is the No. 1 problem — 4 acres of forest are clear-cut on average to produce 1 acre of crop. The result is habitat destruction, emission of greenhouse gases and erosion that fills creeks with silt. Fertilizers and herbicides are used in excessive quantities, which poison and deplete the land and waterways.

Drug enforcement, meanwhile, can worsen problems. The threat of police raids pushes growers to do short crop cycles and relocate often. Police raids push producers deeper into the forest, increasing clear-cutting, without actually reducing supply levels. Plus, a common drug enforcement tactic is aerial crop spraying, which disperses vast quantities of herbicides into an area.

The logging industry, the primary driver of deforestation, has ties to drug organizations. Drug producers need access roads to expand their operations, which encourages illegal logging to clear areas for cultivation. Legitimate logging companies are often used to launder money earned in the drug trade.

Also on Miller-McCune.com, research suggests being aware of one's environmental footprint could cause an ecological backlash.

The disposal of toxic chemicals from drug processing is another growing problem. The refinement of poppy flowers into opium and heroin is a highly toxic process that uses considerable amounts of chemicals such as sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, solvents like acetone and kerosene, and bases such as ammonia. This cocktail ultimately gets dumped in rivers or buried underground - a threat to humans, animals and plants.

This problem is similar to the unregulated toxic dumping by clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in the U.S. The Economist reported that from 2000 to 2002, the number of methamphetamine laboratories uncovered in the U.S. rose from 8,971 to 15,353. Every kilogram of meth product creates 7 kilograms of carcinogenic waste. The popularity of meth is causing a surge in illegally disposed chemicals throughout American cities.

The Sierra Madre Occidental is home to the Tarahumara, a group of indigenous people that has avoided colonization for centuries. The Tarahumara are renown for their extensive knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants, many of which are still finding application in modern Western medicine. Drug operations aggressively displace native Tarahumara Indians and pressure them into cultivating marijuana and poppy fields. This has been accentuated by drought; last year's drought in Mexico caused the failure of corn crops, sometimes forcing subsistence growers into production of cash crops.

One of the most fearless men in the region was the late Edwin Bustillos, a part-Tarahumara who fought for the rights of indigenous communities in the Sierra during the '80s and '90s. Through his organization, Casmac, Bustillos helped communities earn income from alternatives to logging and drug production. His lack of cooperation with local drug cartels — which often purchase cooperation by placing politicians and police officers on the payroll — did not earn many friends. He barely survived three attempts on his life and sustained serious injuries. Bustillos came very close to reaching his goal of creating a biosphere reserve in the Sierra Madre and was recognized for his work by receiving the 1996 Goldman Environment Prize.

The drug-use debate has historically focused on health and crime. However, an increasing awareness of the environmental dimension of drugs is growing. According to Julia Buxton, author of The Political Economy of Narcotics: Production, Consumption, and Global Markets, the improved enforcement technologies of aerial surveillance and remote sensing over the last two decades has provided graphic evidence of land degradation in drug-producing areas. The environmental dimension was first given serious consideration in 1986, when Jamaica's floods were attributed to deforestation from the extensive clear-cutting of cannabis cultivation; then-Prime Minister Edward Seaga used this to bolster support for a U.S.-led drug campaign on their island.

The Drug Destruction of Mexico, Part I

Arriving in Mexico’s mainland, our ecological blogger is brought face-to-face, almost literally, with Mexico’s cartel-driven politics. Read about it here

Drug enforcement has traditionally focused on reducing supply, with very limited results. In terms of demand (convincing drug-users to abstain), a shift has occurred. Whereas drug users dismiss violence abroad as ""far away"" and health impacts as ""exaggerated,"" deforestation is now globally recognized as a contributor to climate change and biodiversity loss. In short, the environment is a global issue, which measures up to the global problems of drug trafficking.

Nowhere is this environmental link more pronounced than in the cocaine production of the Andean countries — Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. ""Each line of cocaine sniffed destroys 4 square yards of rainforest,"" said Colombian Vice President Francisco Santos, representing a campaign called Shared Responsibility. People may drive a hybrid, recycle and worry about global warming, yet still not realize their night of partying can destroy 4 square yards (or more)of rainforest.

This November, voters in California may decide to legalize marijuana. Proponents say that the problems of supply (violence, corruption, ecological destruction) and demand (health) can be dealt with more effectively if the drug is regulated. Opponents say that putting marijuana on the same level as alcohol will increase drug use.

The debate is difficult because both sides are probably correct. In a world where people need to escape the disenchantment of city life by getting high, where living five years rich is better than a lifetime poor, and our environmental and social fabric is disintegrating as a consequence, I wonder: For how much longer will our society tolerate self-destruction?","The Drug Destruction of Mexico, Part II",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vcHNtYWcuY29tL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L3RoZS1kcnVnLWRlc3RydWN0aW9uLW9mLW1leGljby1wYXJ0LWlpLTE5MzQz0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9wc21hZy5jb20vLmFtcC9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC90aGUtZHJ1Zy1kZXN0cnVjdGlvbi1vZi1tZXhpY28tcGFydC1paS0xOTM0Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://psmag.com/.image/t_share/MTI3NTgxMDYzNDY2Nzg5NTA3/mmw_sierramapsmall-300x207.jpg,2010-07-15,"{'sent': 'When I grew up in Mazatlán, I\'d hear people say, it\'s better to live five years rich than a lifetime poor,"" I was told by Daniel, who is studying law at a university in Mexico City.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Mexico City', 'Mazatlán'], 'ORG': ['Daniel']}}","When I grew up in Mazatlán, I'd hear people say, it's better to live five years rich than a lifetime poor,"" I was told by Daniel, who is studying law at a university in Mexico City. ""Sometimes it would even be written on walls.""

In a different context this phrase might be promoting righteous work for personal progress. But since we were talking about the drug cartels in Mexico, I knew the meaning was shady — it is a justification for what decent men resort to while dancing to the seductive song of the drug trade.

As the drug war escalates, more civilians are caught in the crossfire. There have been innocent bystanders for decades, far from the gun battles in cities: the damage of drug production to the land, water and air. The environment has been the forgotten victim, raped and pillaged without notice.

Inland from Mazatlán and spanning several states is the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range, one of the most ecologically diverse areas in North America. Mountain peaks up to 9,000 feet and deep valleys like the Copper Canyon set geographical limits for many temperate and tropical species — eagles and hawks soar above pine forests, green parakeets and boa constrictors roam the canyons.

The area has 200 species of oak trees and is world-renown for its endemic bird species such as the thick-billed parrot, which is in danger of extinction. Largely due to deforestation from logging and drug production, only 2 percent, or 300,000 acres, of old growth forest remain.

Map of the Sierra Madre Occidental mountain range. Click to enlarge.

From the coastal state of Sinaloa to the border state of Chihuahua, the warm sunshine and mild winters of the Sierra Madre Occidental make it incredibly productive for drug cultivation. Its vast stretches of unpatrolled wilderness and direct distribution corridor into the U.S. (via Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) have made the Sierra Madre Occidental one of the world's largest drug-producing regions for marijuana and opium.

Drug production is adding fuel to the destruction of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Deforestation is the No. 1 problem — 4 acres of forest are clear-cut on average to produce 1 acre of crop. The result is habitat destruction, emission of greenhouse gases and erosion that fills creeks with silt. Fertilizers and herbicides are used in excessive quantities, which poison and deplete the land and waterways.

Drug enforcement, meanwhile, can worsen problems. The threat of police raids pushes growers to do short crop cycles and relocate often. Police raids push producers deeper into the forest, increasing clear-cutting, without actually reducing supply levels. Plus, a common drug enforcement tactic is aerial crop spraying, which disperses vast quantities of herbicides into an area.

The logging industry, the primary driver of deforestation, has ties to drug organizations. Drug producers need access roads to expand their operations, which encourages illegal logging to clear areas for cultivation. Legitimate logging companies are often used to launder money earned in the drug trade.

Also on Miller-McCune.com, research suggests being aware of one's environmental footprint could cause an ecological backlash.

The disposal of toxic chemicals from drug processing is another growing problem. The refinement of poppy flowers into opium and heroin is a highly toxic process that uses considerable amounts of chemicals such as sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, solvents like acetone and kerosene, and bases such as ammonia. This cocktail ultimately gets dumped in rivers or buried underground - a threat to humans, animals and plants.

This problem is similar to the unregulated toxic dumping by clandestine methamphetamine laboratories in the U.S. The Economist reported that from 2000 to 2002, the number of methamphetamine laboratories uncovered in the U.S. rose from 8,971 to 15,353.

0,"Classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN Red List, listed among the Top 25 Most Endangered primates in the world, and rated number 71 on the EDGE’s list of world’s most endangered and unique mammals, the yellow-tailed woolly monkey needed some good news—and this week it got it. The conservation organization, Neotropical Primate Conservation (NPC), has announced the discovery of an unknown population of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda), buttressing hopes that the species will survive in the long-term.

Native to the cloud forests of north-eastern Peru, the yellow-tailed woolly monkey was thought extinct until it was rediscovered in 1974. The new population has been found in an area where the monkey has not been recorded for decades. The global population of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey has been estimated at less than 250 individuals.



Habitat loss, such as deforestation pictured here, is one of the main causes behind the yellow-tailed woolly monkey’s decline. Photo courtesy of NPC.

“With such a small wild population, these new areas give new hope for the species’ survival. There are already initiatives underway for the protection of the yellow-tailed woolly monkeys, which we hope will now include protection of these new populations,” Sam Shanee, the co-founder of NPC, said in a press release. NPC is one of the only conservation organizations working with this gravely imperiled species.

The monkey’s survival is threatened by deforestation, encroaching agriculture, and bushmeat hunting. The area is also known for cocaine smugglers and communist rebels, increasing the difficulty of research and conservation efforts.

Despite such difficulties, NPC works closely with local people to help save the species from extinction.

“Local communities are enthusiastic about cooperating and even initiating conservation work. They make us very optimistic for the future of this very special monkey,” says Noga Shanee, another co-found of NPC. The organization has also established a reforestation project in the area.

(10/26/2010) Hunters’ reports have led scientists to discover a new species of monkey in the northern forests of Myanmar. Discovered by biologists from the Myanmar Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association with support from primatologists with Fauna & Flora International (FFI) and the People Resources and Biodiversity Foundation, the strange looking primate is a member of the snub-nosed monkey family, adding a fifth member to this unmistakably odd-looking group of Asian primates. However, the species survives in only a small single population, threatened by Chinese logging and hunting.

(08/11/2010) While the Amazon is being whittled away on all sides by logging, agriculture, roads, cattle ranching, mining, oil and gas exploration, today’s announcement of a new monkey species proves that the world’s greatest tropical rainforest still has many surprises to reveal. Scientists with the National University of Colombia and support from Conservation International (CI) have announced the discovery of a new monkey in the journal Primate Conservation on the Colombian border with Peru and Ecuador. The new species is a titi monkey, dubbed the Caquetá titi ( Callicebus caquetensis). However, the announcement comes with deep concern as researchers say it is likely the new species is already Critically Endangered due to a small population living in an area undergoing rapid deforestation for agriculture.

0,"More species are threatened with extinction in Indonesia than any other country on Earth. If we are to save them, it will take more protected areas, radical shifts in deforestation, and better anti-poaching efforts, but in many cases it will also take species-specific conservation efforts that work directly with local people. The Alliance for Tompotika Conservation (AlTo) is a model organization for this method, founder Marcy Summers describes it as “very small, community-based, and efficient, with very low overhead.” By focusing on the wonderfully bizarre maleo (Macrocephalon maleo), a ground-nesting bird on the island of Sulawesi, the organization has succeeded in protecting a vital nesting area while initiating a moratorium on the egg-harvesting, which once devastated the species.



Sulawesi’s endangered Maleo bird (Macrocephalon maleo)

“Since the moratorium began in 2006, we’ve protected over 5000 eggs, chicks are hatching naturally, and the number of adult maleos returning to this nesting ground to lay eggs has tripled. Some days it even gets crowded out there on the nesting ground—a great problem to have!—and we see signs of maleos starting to lay in new nearby locations,” Summers told mongabay.com in a recent interview.

According to Summers, the entire initiative started in 2004 with a presentation she gave local people on the island’s unique and disappearing wildlife, including the maleo.

“At that point I think they had never really thought about their maleo bird as something special, something to be proud of, and something they stood to lose if they weren’t careful,” she explains.

Village leaders than approached Summers—who was at the time working with The Nature Conservancy (TNC)—to help them develop a conservation program to save the maleo. The program started as completely volunteer-based, but transformed again due to another presentation by Summers this time in an Audubon group in the US.

“A core group of wonderfully able, committed conservationists stepped forward to join this alliance and try to help the folks in Tompotika save their maleo. Since then the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation—called ‘AL-TO’ for short in both Indonesian and English—has become an independent 501c3 non-profit organization in the United States and a registered “Yayasan” (non-profit equivalent) in Indonesia […] We now have four major field programs (maleo, sea turtle, fruit bat, and forest conservation) plus ongoing outreach, awareness, and Art for Conservation programs, and we also sponsor annual eco-service trips to the area,” she says.

The moratorium on egg collecting was not an organizational decree, but instead proposed by the locals themselves, concerned with the fate of the rare bird.

“We launched the moratorium with much food and fanfare in August of 2006. In this village of Taima, Tompotika, we set things up so that the guys who previously had taken turns parceling out the right to take eggs now would take turns earning a daily wage—a better, more reliable wage—as guards at the nesting ground,” Summers says, adding that, “in the beginning, the conversation was mostly all about economics: the guys who dug the eggs realized that they could make more money as guards than they did from the sale of maleo eggs, so they were willing to try it. But now, they have come to know the maleo better, watching them all day. The maleo itself is no longer just an object to be exploited, but means something to them now.”

Still AlTo’s successes have not come without difficulty.

“It is very hard to be successful at conservation anywhere in the world, but especially here! We struggle with a lot of factors—apathy, ignorance, or corruption among those in power; a seemingly insatiable public appetite for more cash, goods, and technology; funding limitations; insufficient numbers of committed, local environmentalists ready to be trained as AlTo staff. But ultimately most of the challenges all boil down to the same thing: getting people to know and care about the natural systems of which they are a part,” she says.



Strangler fig in North Sulawesi

But this is not a problem unique to Indonesia. In fact, Summers says that if the world’s species are not to vanish entirely, the industrial world, as well as the developing, must change.

“People in the U.S. and members of the ‘Global Consumer Class’ simply need to wake up. Our precious and glorious planet is bleeding, and despite climate change, deforestation, ocean collapse, biodiversity loss, and more, we’re refusing to see it. What’s cutting those wounds deeper and deeper every day is the combination of an ever-expanding world human population with the rising rate of resource consumption of those nearly seven billion human beings,” she says.

In a December 2010 interview Marcy Summers talked with mongabay.com about the unique island of Sulawesi, working with locals to save the maleo bird, challenges to conservation in Indonesia and how to overcome them.

Marcy Summers: My family has deep roots in the Puget Sound area of the U.S.’s Washington State, where I grew up and live now. As a kid I was an animal nut: I spent hours observing birds & squirrels at our feeder; typed up lists of the world’s endangered species (at that time there were few enough that you could do that!) and formed clubs with my friends to save them; and I kept a menagerie with a pet from each vertebrate taxon. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to have had all kinds of jobs and lived in several different countries—I’ve been a baker, farmer, veterinary technician, construction worker, mayor of a small town, editor, wildlife field technician, gardener, eldercare worker—you name it—and this varied life and work experience has taught me how to work with all kinds of people. I like people immensely, but my deepest calling has always been to work with animals and wildlife. I also love the Arts and Humanities, and did a bachelor’s degree in Comparative Religion and Fine Arts at Harvard University before doing a master’s in Wildlife Ecology & Conservation at the University of Maine. For 13 years, I worked for The Nature Conservancy (TNC), first in the U.S. and then in Indonesia and the Pacific Islands. It was when I was living and working for TNC in Indonesia that I first got to know Sulawesi, and visited Tompotika.

mongabay.com: What is the origin of the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation?







Maleo bird egg

Marcy Summers: I first visited the Tompotika area as part of my work for TNC, ground-truthing a vegetation map we were creating for the island of Sulawesi. On that visit, in 2004, I met and became friends with a local politician and environmentalist called Yani Mile, and I also learned that Tompotika had one of the best remaining communal nesting grounds of the endangered maleo bird, Macrocephalon maleo—a remarkable, iconic bird which has great cultural importance in Sulawesi but is in steep decline due primarily to overharvest of its huge eggs. Yani asked if I would come back sometime and give a presentation to local villagers about their wildlife.

So, a few months later I came back on my own time, with my two kids, and spent time in the villages near the nesting ground. Villagers and local leaders all gathered to hear my presentation about what makes Sulawesi—and Tompotika in particular—so very unusual and precious from the perspective of global biodiversity and conservation. I concluded by talking about the maleo bird—about how it is found only in Sulawesi, how unique is its life story of incubating its eggs in warm sand or hot springs, how it has already disappeared from most of its former range, and how here near their village was one of the maleo’s last best strongholds—but inevitably, it would disappear here as well in a few years if they continued to take every maleo egg, as they were doing now. At that point I think they had never really thought about their maleo bird as something special, something to be proud of, and something they stood to lose if they weren’t careful. After the presentation, the village leaders asked if I would help them design some kind of conservation program to make sure that the maleo didn’t disappear from their nesting ground. To such a request, how could one possibly say no?

We began by assembling allies and discussing options—at that time it was just a volunteer effort in my spare time. But in 2005-06 I left TNC, moved back to my home on Vashon Island in the United States, and gave another presentation about Sulawesi and the maleo bird to the local Audubon group there—a hotbed of environmental talent and energy if there ever was one! A core group of wonderfully able, committed conservationists stepped forward to join this alliance and try to help the folks in Tompotika save their maleo. Since then the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation—called “AL-TO” for short in both Indonesian and English—has become an independent 501c3 non-profit organization in the United States and a registered “Yayasan” (non-profit equivalent) in Indonesia, with Boards in both countries; one U.S. and six Indonesian full-time employees; and scores of village assistants who help with our field programs. We now have four major field programs (maleo, sea turtle, fruit bat, and forest conservation) plus ongoing outreach, awareness, and Art for Conservation programs, and we also sponsor annual eco-service trips to the area. But we remain very small, community-based, and efficient, with very low overhead.

mongabay.com: How did the moratorium on maleo egg collection come into being? Are you seeing signs of success?





Marcy Summers: Those initial discussions with villagers in 2004-05 ultimately led to villagers themselves proposing a complete moratorium on the harvesting of maleo eggs. The eggs are not needed for subsistence, but were sold as a luxury and status item, a little like caviar. Taking eggs has actually been illegal since 1990 but until recently no one paid attention to that law. We launched the moratorium with much food and fanfare in August of 2006. In this village of Taima, Tompotika, we set things up so that the guys who previously had taken turns parceling out the right to take eggs now would take turns earning a daily wage—a better, more reliable wage—as guards at the nesting ground. Each day, one of these village guards is paired with one of our regular AlTo staff, who are conservation-minded college students from the Tompotika area that we have trained in ecology, outreach, and conservation field techniques, and they record data and bring breadth and accountability to the project.



With AlTo’s help, these ladies have reclaimed their lost weaving tradition, not practiced for 12 years. Now, they are earning money for their families and passing on their traditional weaving techniques to the next generation. Their weaving skills and support for their families earns them increased freedom and respect and helps reduce the pressure to illegally log the surrounding forests.

The moratorium has worked beautifully. Because pretty much the entire village was behind it from the beginning, we almost never have problems with attempted poaching. Villagers enthusiastically renewed the initial shorter-term contracts, and we just renewed for another five years. And what is perhaps most exciting to me is the change we’ve seen in the meaning that villagers attach to the program and the maleo itself. In the beginning, the conversation was mostly all about economics: the guys who dug the eggs realized that they could make more money as guards than they did from the sale of maleo eggs, so they were willing to try it. But now, they have come to know the maleo better, watching them all day. The maleo itself is no longer just an object to be exploited, but means something to them now. At our recent meeting to renew the contract, villagers spoke of how excited they were to see juvenile maleos in the area, for the first time in living memory. They spoke of how proud they were that the outside world has recognized and honored them for their efforts to conserve this remarkable bird. (In March 2010, Taima village was honored by the international community with the first “Maleo Award” for outstanding conservation.) And they spoke of their grandchildren, and how they want the maleos to still be around for them. I think the villagers are coming to have what theologian Martin Buber calls an “I-thou” rather than an “I-it” relationship with the maleo bird, and by extension, with the rest of their natural surroundings—and that is truly exhilarating.

Best of all, everyone is benefiting, not least the maleos themselves. Since the moratorium began in 2006, we’ve protected over 5000 eggs, chicks are hatching naturally, and the number of adult maleos returning to this nesting ground to lay eggs has tripled. Some days it even gets crowded out there on the nesting ground—a great problem to have!—and we see signs of maleos starting to lay in new nearby locations. Fortunately, we’ve been able to work with the village to protect the key forested corridor which connects the nesting ground to nearby rainforest habitat. We even recently were able to persuade a local business concern to change the location of its planned new coconut oil factory, moving it away from the chosen spot less than 1 km from the nesting ground to another location far away. In that effort, we were strongly supported by village and district government officials, who have come to regard maleo conservation as important.

mongabay.com: Why is Tompotika special?

Marcy Summers: The island of Sulawesi, of which Tompotika is one remote peninsula, is a global treasure for biodiversity. Though not as species-rich as its better-known neighbors such as Borneo or Sumatra, Sulawesi is much higher in endemism: almost half of Sulawesi’s vertebrate species are found nowhere else in the world, and in some taxa—non-volant mammals, for example—that number is over 90%. And it’s not just that Sulawesi has unique species—it’s that they occur in unusual combinations. Sulawesi has never been connected to a continental landmass—its many odd arms and peninsulas were each isolated island fragments from various Asian and Australasian origins, which plate tectonics brought together over millions of years to form today’s strangely-shaped island. Sulawesi’s flora and fauna reflect that strange mixing, so that, for example, you find both Tonkean macaques—primates from Asian origins—and bear cuscuses—marsupials from Australian roots—in the same forests. One of the first to document this was 19th-century naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace, in whose honor the region is often referred to as “Wallacea.” So rich is Sulawesi’s biodiversity, so ripe the opportunities to conserve it, and so devastating the costs if we do not, in fact, that conservation priorities analyses in recent years have repeatedly ranked Sulawesi at the top of the list when it comes to where we should be directing our conservation attention and resources.

Sulawesi itself varies considerably from one region to another, and although suffering from deforestation and natural areas conversion like the rest of Indonesia, there remain many high-quality natural areas on the island. When I worked for TNC, we did a comprehensive analysis to identify the most important remaining areas for conservation in Sulawesi, and Tompotika was one of them. The Tompotika peninsula is connected only by a narrow neck to the rest of Sulawesi’s central arm, and its soils (mostly ultrabasic) are different from those nearby. So, within the hotbed of endemism which is all of Sulawesi, even in the relatively small 2400 km2 area of Tompotika, we have at least 7 species known only from Tompotika. And that’s just among reptiles and amphibians—most taxa haven’t even been surveyed. In addition to beautiful, intact tropical rainforests, the Tompotika area also hosts high-quality offshore coral reefs, mangroves, savannah grasslands, some unusual cave formations, and the full complement of Sulawesi’s endemic megafauna, including the dwarf buffalo anoa, the strange babirusa deer-pig, shy dwarf cuscuses, majestic red-knobbed hornbills, gremlin-like tarsiers, and others—many of which have been extirpated from other parts of Sulawesi.

Tompotika also has a great deal of cultural significance: at the center of the peninsula stands 1600m Mt. Tompotika, which is rich with stories and legends and considered a sacred point of origin for all three of the ethnic groups native to that area.

mongabay.com: What are the biggest threats to forests and biodiversity in the region?







Tarsier in North Sulawesi

Marcy Summers: The main threats to forests and biodiversity in Tompotika are much the same as in other parts of Indonesia: uncontrolled logging (both legal and illegal), mining (mainly nickel), conversion for small-scale agriculture, and most recently, conversion for palm oil plantations. This latter is the fastest-growing threat in our area, as many locals see palm oil as a potential cash source that can be implemented more easily and on a smaller scale than, say, mining—but its effects on Tompotika’s forests are proving to be devastating. For certain species, overharvest is also a huge problem—for sea turtles, for example—and for many other rare and endangered species that are legally protected but still widely poached. And, it’s too early to know for sure, but we seem to be seeing increased rainfall in the Tompotika area, probably due to climate change, and this will likely have broad impacts of many different kinds that we’re only just beginning to understand.

mongabay.com: What are the biggest challenges you face?







Crested black macaque in North Sulawesi

Marcy Summers: Oh! The challenges are legion, and sometimes very daunting—it is very hard to be successful at conservation anywhere in the world, but especially here! We struggle with a lot of factors—apathy, ignorance, or corruption among those in power; a seemingly insatiable public appetite for more cash, goods, and technology; funding limitations; insufficient numbers of committed, local environmentalists ready to be trained as AlTo staff. But ultimately most of the challenges all boil down to the same thing: getting people to know and care about the natural systems of which they are a part. Until they are educated and called to another perspective, most people don’t understand how their human lives depend on healthy natural systems, and they care more about short-term gains and their own immediate personal convenience than about their long-term well-being and the health of the planet and their human and non-human neighbors. It’s a long and hard process to change that, but we are seeing that it can and does happen.

mongabay.com: Tompotika is not a national park. What are the tradeoffs associated with becoming a national park?





Marcy Summers: The national park system in Indonesia includes some of the largest and most intact natural areas left—in Sulawesi, for example, Bogani Nani Wartabone and Lore Lindu National Parks are critical strongholds for forests and wildlife, and provide the main backbone for natural areas conservation on the island. But they also come with some strings attached, the biggest being that national parks are managed by Indonesia’s central (national) government. As such, they are subject to all the vagaries of an Indonesian government ministry: power plays, corruption, mismanagement.



Strangler fig in North Sulawesi

The Forestry Department is part of the larger government context, and it’s probably even one of the better ministries, but there’s no escape from these crippling problems that run throughout the system. The result is that most national parks receive very inadequate on-the-ground protection—whether it’s because of a national policy that has deliberately opened them up for mining, or because someone in the line of power is turning a blind eye to lucrative illegal logging. Also, park rangers and managers are part of a national rotation. In any given park, they cycle in and out, are probably from another part of Indonesia, and don’t necessarily have a chance to get to know or care about the place they are supposed to be protecting before they are transferred somewhere else. And finally, there is generally little attempt to integrate the livelihoods of residents living around (or inside) parks with the sustainability of the park.

In Tompotika, we’ve opted to take a different approach. Although they’re disappearing fast, there are still many high-quality natural areas outside of the national parks and protected areas system in Indonesia. In Tompotika, we’ve started with the local people surrounding the intact forests of Mt. Tompotika, and we’re working directly with them and with local-level governments to help support sustainable livelihoods while protecting the 10,000 hectares of forest immediately surrounding the mountain. We’re training local farmers in organic farming techniques to conserve and enrich soil, and get higher yields from their existing agricultural lands, so that they won’t need to cut and clear new tracts of native forest. We’re hiring them as patrolers to protect the forests, we’re in process of designing a forest restoration project that will hire local villagers to rehabilitate degraded and abandoned patches of formerly forested lands, and we sponsor eco-tourist visits to the area. And through it all, we really push the awareness piece with both adults and children, emphasizing how healthy human communities depend on intact and healthy ecosystems. By starting at the local level, and building support and “ownership” of the protected forest from the ground up, we believe the local and regional public and governments are much more invested in protecting the forests, and we avoid the complications of national-level oversight entirely.

mongabay.com: Do you see opportunities to improve national park administration in Indonesia?







Red-knobbed hornbills in North Sulawesi

Marcy Summers: Certainly there are many aspects of national park management that could be improved, as noted above—and I applaud the good souls who are focusing on this, just as I applaud government efforts to prosecute illegal timber barons and wildlife traffickers, and the generally strengthened attempts to root out corruption. For our part, however, at this stage I’m more inclined to focus on opportunities to achieve real conservation progress in those remaining natural areas like Tompotika that are not yet protected, by starting to work directly with local people and building support for protection from the local level up. We are just a little conservation partnership, and reforming Indonesia’s national park system is more than we could take on—but we can still make significant, tangible progress in protecting a high-quality, intact but vulnerable area of Sulawesi’s native rainforest.

mongabay.com: How can people in the U.S. help your efforts?

Marcy Summers: Well, one obvious way that folks can help is to donate money to support the efforts of conservation NGO’s like ours (see our website at tompotika.org). If you care about the health of our planet, that’s an easy, direct, and significant way to help. But less easily, though perhaps more importantly, people in the U.S. and members of the “Global Consumer Class” simply need to wake up. Our precious and glorious planet is bleeding, and despite climate change, deforestation, ocean collapse, biodiversity loss, and more, we’re refusing to see it. What’s cutting those wounds deeper and deeper every day is the combination of an ever-expanding world human population with the rising rate of resource consumption of those nearly seven billion human beings. In the U.S., we consume something like a quarter of the world’s resources, though we are only 4% of world population. That’s obscene, and that’s ultimately what’s driving the destruction of places like Tompotika: the nickel mine and the palm oil plantations that are threatening to destroy Tompotika’s forests are being proposed to feed the rapacious appetites of consumers in the developed world who want more electronic gadgets and processed foods. That ultimately is what we must come to terms with, individually and collectively, if there is to be any future for places like Tompotika (or, indeed, our own back yards); people in the U.S. can help best of all by changing our own lifestyles and political priorities so that we move our country toward being part of the solution, not the continuing source of the problem. AlTo is an international partnership, comprising folks from Indonesia, the U.S., and several other countries, and we are keenly aware of this: the world is still looking to the U.S. for leadership in this arena. The trail ahead toward a healed planet and a green future awaits someone’s blazing, but it remains to be seen: who will step forward?

Saving Sulawesi’s ‘pig-deer’, the babirusa



(12/06/2010) The babirusa of Sulawesi may be one of the world’s oddest looking—and acting—mammals. Literally meaning ‘pig-deer’ the babirusa, which includes four species, belongs to its own genus ‘Babyrousa’ in the pig family. Males are especially unique, sporting four tusks, two of which appear to come right out of the animal’s snout. To make it to the top of the babirusa hierarchy, males will combat each other in an activity dubbed ‘boxing’ where they will rear up on their hind legs and club at each other. Despite their many oddities, the babriusa were not formally studied until the late 1980s when Dr. Lynn Clayton spent four years in Sulawesi’s forest observing them.

If we are to save them, it will take more protected areas, radical shifts in deforestation, and better anti-poaching efforts, but in many cases it will also take species-specific conservation efforts that work directly with local people. The Alliance for Tompotika Conservation (AlTo) is a model organization for this method, founder Marcy Summers describes it as “very small, community-based, and efficient, with very low overhead.” By focusing on the wonderfully bizarre maleo (Macrocephalon maleo), a ground-nesting bird on the island of Sulawesi, the organization has succeeded in protecting a vital nesting area while initiating a moratorium on the egg-harvesting, which once devastated the species.



Sulawesi’s endangered Maleo bird (Macrocephalon maleo)

“Since the moratorium began in 2006, we’ve protected over 5000 eggs, chicks are hatching naturally, and the number of adult maleos returning to this nesting ground to lay eggs has tripled. Some days it even gets crowded out there on the nesting ground—a great problem to have!—and we see signs of maleos starting to lay in new nearby locations,” Summers told mongabay.com in a recent interview.

According to Summers, the entire initiative started in 2004 with a presentation she gave local people on the island’s unique and disappearing wildlife, including the maleo.

“At that point I think they had never really thought about their maleo bird as something special, something to be proud of, and something they stood to lose if they weren’t careful,” she explains.

Village leaders than approached Summers—who was at the time working with The Nature Conservancy (TNC)—to help them develop a conservation program to save the maleo. The program started as completely volunteer-based, but transformed again due to another presentation by Summers this time in an Audubon group in the US.

“A core group of wonderfully able, committed conservationists stepped forward to join this alliance and try to help the folks in Tompotika save their maleo. Since then the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation—called ‘AL-TO’ for short in both Indonesian and English—has become an independent 501c3 non-profit organization in the United States and a registered “Yayasan” (non-profit equivalent) in Indonesia […] We now have four major field programs (maleo, sea turtle, fruit bat, and forest conservation) plus ongoing outreach, awareness, and Art for Conservation programs, and we also sponsor annual eco-service trips to the area,” she says.

The moratorium on egg collecting was not an organizational decree, but instead proposed by the locals themselves, concerned with the fate of the rare bird.

“We launched the moratorium with much food and fanfare in August of 2006. In this village of Taima, Tompotika, we set things up so that the guys who previously had taken turns parceling out the right to take eggs now would take turns earning a daily wage—a better, more reliable wage—as guards at the nesting ground,” Summers says, adding that, “in the beginning, the conversation was mostly all about economics: the guys who dug the eggs realized that they could make more money as guards than they did from the sale of maleo eggs, so they were willing to try it. But now, they have come to know the maleo better, watching them all day. The maleo itself is no longer just an object to be exploited, but means something to them now.”

Still AlTo’s successes have not come without difficulty.

“It is very hard to be successful at conservation anywhere in the world, but especially here! We struggle with a lot of factors—apathy, ignorance, or corruption among those in power; a seemingly insatiable public appetite for more cash, goods, and technology; funding limitations; insufficient numbers of committed, local environmentalists ready to be trained as AlTo staff. But ultimately most of the challenges all boil down to the same thing: getting people to know and care about the natural systems of which they are a part,” she says.

But this is not a problem unique to Indonesia. In fact, Summers says that if the world’s species are not to vanish entirely, the industrial world, as well as the developing, must change.

“People in the U.S. and members of the ‘Global Consumer Class’ simply need to wake up. Our precious and glorious planet is bleeding, and despite climate change, deforestation, ocean collapse, biodiversity loss, and more, we’re refusing to see it. What’s cutting those wounds deeper and deeper every day is the combination of an ever-expanding world human population with the rising rate of resource consumption of those nearly seven billion human beings,” she says.

In a December 2010 interview Marcy Summers talked with mongabay.com about the unique island of Sulawesi, working with locals to save the maleo bird, challenges to conservation in Indonesia and how to overcome them.

Marcy Summers: My family has deep roots in the Puget Sound area of the U.S.’s Washington State, where I grew up and live now. As a kid I was an animal nut: I spent hours observing birds & squirrels at our feeder; typed up lists of the world’s endangered species (at that time there were few enough that you could do that!) and formed clubs with my friends to save them; and I kept a menagerie with a pet from each vertebrate taxon. Over the years, I’ve been fortunate to have had all kinds of jobs and lived in several different countries—I’ve been a baker, farmer, veterinary technician, construction worker, mayor of a small town, editor, wildlife field technician, gardener, eldercare worker—you name it—and this varied life and work experience has taught me how to work with all kinds of people. I like people immensely, but my deepest calling has always been to work with animals and wildlife. I also love the Arts and Humanities, and did a bachelor’s degree in Comparative Religion and Fine Arts at Harvard University before doing a master’s in Wildlife Ecology & Conservation at the University of Maine. For 13 years, I worked for The Nature Conservancy (TNC), first in the U.S. and then in Indonesia and the Pacific Islands. It was when I was living and working for TNC in Indonesia that I first got to know Sulawesi, and visited Tompotika.

mongabay.com: What is the origin of the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation?







Maleo bird egg

Marcy Summers: I first visited the Tompotika area as part of my work for TNC, ground-truthing a vegetation map we were creating for the island of Sulawesi. On that visit, in 2004, I met and became friends with a local politician and environmentalist called Yani Mile, and I also learned that Tompotika had one of the best remaining communal nesting grounds of the endangered maleo bird, Macrocephalon maleo—a remarkable, iconic bird which has great cultural importance in Sulawesi but is in steep decline due primarily to overharvest of its huge eggs. Yani asked if I would come back sometime and give a presentation to local villagers about their wildlife.

So, a few months later I came back on my own time, with my two kids, and spent time in the villages near the nesting ground. Villagers and local leaders all gathered to hear my presentation about what makes Sulawesi—and Tompotika in particular—so very unusual and precious from the perspective of global biodiversity and conservation.

The Tompotika peninsula is connected only by a narrow neck to the rest of Sulawesi’s central arm, and its soils (mostly ultrabasic) are different from those nearby. So, within the hotbed of endemism which is all of Sulawesi, even in the relatively small 2400 km2 area of Tompotika, we have at least 7 species known only from Tompotika. And that’s just among reptiles and amphibians—most taxa haven’t even been surveyed. In addition to beautiful, intact tropical rainforests, the Tompotika area also hosts high-quality offshore coral reefs, mangroves, savannah grasslands, some unusual cave formations, and the full complement of Sulawesi’s endemic megafauna, including the dwarf buffalo anoa, the strange babirusa deer-pig, shy dwarf cuscuses, majestic red-knobbed hornbills, gremlin-like tarsiers, and others—many of which have been extirpated from other parts of Sulawesi.

Tompotika also has a great deal of cultural significance: at the center of the peninsula stands 1600m Mt. Tompotika, which is rich with stories and legends and considered a sacred point of origin for all three of the ethnic groups native to that area.

Tarsier in North Sulawesi

Marcy Summers: The main threats to forests and biodiversity in Tompotika are much the same as in other parts of Indonesia: uncontrolled logging (both legal and illegal), mining (mainly nickel), conversion for small-scale agriculture, and most recently, conversion for palm oil plantations. This latter is the fastest-growing threat in our area, as many locals see palm oil as a potential cash source that can be implemented more easily and on a smaller scale than, say, mining—but its effects on Tompotika’s forests are proving to be devastating. For certain species, overharvest is also a huge problem—for sea turtles, for example—and for many other rare and endangered species that are legally protected but still widely poached. And, it’s too early to know for sure, but we seem to be seeing increased rainfall in the Tompotika area, probably due to climate change, and this will likely have broad impacts of many different kinds that we’re only just beginning to understand.

mongabay.com: What are the biggest challenges you face?

Marcy Summers: Oh! The challenges are legion, and sometimes very daunting—it is very hard to be successful at conservation anywhere in the world, but especially here! We struggle with a lot of factors—apathy, ignorance, or corruption among those in power; a seemingly insatiable public appetite for more cash, goods, and technology; funding limitations; insufficient numbers of committed, local environmentalists ready to be trained as AlTo staff. But ultimately most of the challenges all boil down to the same thing: getting people to know and care about the natural systems of which they are a part. Until they are educated and called to another perspective, most people don’t understand how their human lives depend on healthy natural systems, and they care more about short-term gains and their own immediate personal convenience than about their long-term well-being and the health of the planet and their human and non-human neighbors. It’s a long and hard process to change that, but we are seeing that it can and does happen.

mongabay.com: Tompotika is not a national park. What are the tradeoffs associated with becoming a national park?





Marcy Summers: The national park system in Indonesia includes some of the largest and most intact natural areas left—in Sulawesi, for example, Bogani Nani Wartabone and Lore Lindu National Parks are critical strongholds for forests and wildlife, and provide the main backbone for natural areas conservation on the island. But they also come with some strings attached, the biggest being that national parks are managed by Indonesia’s central (national) government. As such, they are subject to all the vagaries of an Indonesian government ministry: power plays, corruption, mismanagement.

The Forestry Department is part of the larger government context, and it’s probably even one of the better ministries, but there’s no escape from these crippling problems that run throughout the system. The result is that most national parks receive very inadequate on-the-ground protection—whether it’s because of a national policy that has deliberately opened them up for mining, or because someone in the line of power is turning a blind eye to lucrative illegal logging. Also, park rangers and managers are part of a national rotation. In any given park, they cycle in and out, are probably from another part of Indonesia, and don’t necessarily have a chance to get to know or care about the place they are supposed to be protecting before they are transferred somewhere else. And finally, there is generally little attempt to integrate the livelihoods of residents living around (or inside) parks with the sustainability of the park.

In Tompotika, we’ve opted to take a different approach. Although they’re disappearing fast, there are still many high-quality natural areas outside of the national parks and protected areas system in Indonesia. In Tompotika, we’ve started with the local people surrounding the intact forests of Mt. Tompotika, and we’re working directly with them and with local-level governments to help support sustainable livelihoods while protecting the 10,000 hectares of forest immediately surrounding the mountain. We’re training local farmers in organic farming techniques to conserve and enrich soil, and get higher yields from their existing agricultural lands, so that they won’t need to cut and clear new tracts of native forest. We’re hiring them as patrolers to protect the forests, we’re in process of designing a forest restoration project that will hire local villagers to rehabilitate degraded and abandoned patches of formerly forested lands, and we sponsor eco-tourist visits to the area. And through it all, we really push the awareness piece with both adults and children, emphasizing how healthy human communities depend on intact and healthy ecosystems. By starting at the local level, and building support and “ownership” of the protected forest from the ground up, we believe the local and regional public and governments are much more invested in protecting the forests, and we avoid the complications of national-level oversight entirely.

mongabay.com: Do you see opportunities to improve national park administration in Indonesia?







Red-knobbed hornbills in North Sulawesi

Marcy Summers: Certainly there are many aspects of national park management that could be improved, as noted above—and I applaud the good souls who are focusing on this, just as I applaud government efforts to prosecute illegal timber barons and wildlife traffickers, and the generally strengthened attempts to root out corruption. For our part, however, at this stage I’m more inclined to focus on opportunities to achieve real conservation progress in those remaining natural areas like Tompotika that are not yet protected, by starting to work directly with local people and building support for protection from the local level up. We are just a little conservation partnership, and reforming Indonesia’s national park system is more than we could take on—but we can still make significant, tangible progress in protecting a high-quality, intact but vulnerable area of Sulawesi’s native rainforest.

mongabay.com: How can people in the U.S. help your efforts?

Marcy Summers: Well, one obvious way that folks can help is to donate money to support the efforts of conservation NGO’s like ours (see our website at tompotika.org). If you care about the health of our planet, that’s an easy, direct, and significant way to help. But less easily, though perhaps more importantly, people in the U.S. and members of the “Global Consumer Class” simply need to wake up. Our precious and glorious planet is bleeding, and despite climate change, deforestation, ocean collapse, biodiversity loss, and more, we’re refusing to see it. What’s cutting those wounds deeper and deeper every day is the combination of an ever-expanding world human population with the rising rate of resource consumption of those nearly seven billion human beings. In the U.S., we consume something like a quarter of the world’s resources, though we are only 4% of world population. That’s obscene, and that’s ultimately what’s driving the destruction of places like Tompotika: the nickel mine and the palm oil plantations that are threatening to destroy Tompotika’s forests are being proposed to feed the rapacious appetites of consumers in the developed world who want more electronic gadgets and processed foods. That ultimately is what we must come to terms with, individually and collectively, if there is to be any future for places like Tompotika (or, indeed, our own back yards); people in the U.S. can help best of all by changing our own lifestyles and political priorities so that we move our country toward being part of the solution, not the continuing source of the problem. AlTo is an international partnership, comprising folks from Indonesia, the U.S., and several other countries, and we are keenly aware of this: the world is still looking to the U.S. for leadership in this arena. The trail ahead toward a healed planet and a green future awaits someone’s blazing, but it remains to be seen: who will step forward?

Saving Sulawesi’s ‘pig-deer’, the babirusa



(12/06/2010) The babirusa of Sulawesi may be one of the world’s oddest looking—and acting—mammals. Literally meaning ‘pig-deer’ the babirusa, which includes four species, belongs to its own genus ‘Babyrousa’ in the pig family. Males are especially unique, sporting four tusks, two of which appear to come right out of the animal’s snout. To make it to the top of the babirusa hierarchy, males will combat each other in an activity dubbed ‘boxing’ where they will rear up on their hind legs and club at each other. Despite their many oddities, the babriusa were not formally studied until the late 1980s when Dr. Lynn Clayton spent four years in Sulawesi’s forest observing them.

Scientists propose conservation areas for the unique island of Sulawesi

(01/06/2008) Little-known Sulawesi may be the world’s most strangely shaped island: with four large peninsulas jutting outward, the island could either resemble a mangled lower-case ‘k’ or an upside-down emaciated mermaid—depending on one’s perspective. However when Dr. Charles Cannon states that the island is “one of the most unique spots on Earth”, he is not referring to Sulawesi’s shape but its ecology.

0,"One endangered parrot species just got a major boost: A whopping 20 scarlet macaw fledglings have now taken flight over the forests of Guatemala.

Scarlet macaws, one of the world's largest parrot species, are at threat from destruction of their habitat and poaching for the pet trade. An estimated 95 percent of the scarlet macaws in Guatemala live in the Maya Biosphere Reserve.

Conservationists with the Wildlife Conservation Society and the National Park Service of Guatemala run a monitoring program focused on helping weak and at-risk chicks — some of which were removed from tree cavity nests and hand-reared in a jungle hospital — with guidance from the Bronx Zoo's Department of Ornithology and veterinarians from the Global Health Program.

The rehabilitated chicks are then fostered back in nests with chicks of the same age, a procedure that greatly increased the chances of survival for these rare birds.

Researchers and conservationists from the Wildlife Conservation Society and other groups have helped to raise a bumper crop of scarlet macaw fledglings in the forests of Guatemala, where the species has become threatened by a combination of habitat destruction and poaching for the pet trade. (Image credit: WCS Guatemala Program)

Monitoring scarlet macaw nests is not for the faint of heart. Researchers need to be able to climb trees — often with the aid of rappelling lines nearly 100 feet (30 meters) above the canopy floor — to inspect nests, mount video cameras, and sometimes remove sick chicks from the nesting cavities.

The newly fledged birds are a big success for conservationists working on the program; they were hoping to record at least one fledgling from each of 24 monitored nests during the 2011 season.

With a total estimated population of some 300 scarlet macaws in the country, each successfully fledged bird is critical for the survival of the species. The bumper crop of fledglings in the 2011 season stands in stark contrast to the 2003 season that registered only one fledgling from 15 nests.

""The success in increasing the nesting success of scarlet macaws through intensive chick management and fostering is a great step forward for macaw conservation,"" said Rony Garcia, a conservationist with the Wildlife Conservation Society. ""We believe the lessons learned can not only help save the scarlet macaw in Guatemala, but be extended to help other threatened species of parrots and cavity nesters across the globe.""

Things seem to be going from bad to worse for the lemurs of Madagascar.

A report issued two weeks ago by a working group in Antananarivo, Madagascar’s capital, concludes that these prosimian primate cousins of ours are THE most endangered mammals on the planet with 91 percent of all lemurs on the Red List of threatened status.

In a poor and poorly governed country, humans are steadily chewing away at lemur habitat and at the lemurs themselves.

One species, the northern sportive lemur, is down to just 18 individuals on a tiny speck of habitat at the extreme northern end of the island. There are none in captivity.

“When these species disappear from Madagascar, they are lost forever,” Lemur Center Director Anne Yoder said. Captive breeding programs, like the one at the Duke Lemur Center, are a poor substitute for the protection lemurs really need.

The warning is unfortunately all too familiar to the faculty, staff and volunteers of the DLC, and it casts their work in conservation, education and research as even more critical.

In addition to its crucial work in Durham, DLC has been working on the ground in Madagascar for more than 20 years to preserve habitat and build a corps of conservation-minded citizens. Post-doctoral researcher Erik Patel participated in the Antananarivo workshop and reported on the meeting last week.

At first glance, the brown, speckled and spotted creature blended in among the stones in the pool.

Sam Johnson, wearing calf-high boots, eyed it, tucked tight to a side wall. She waded across and lifted the 2-foot-long Andrias japonicus, or Japanese giant salamander, from the water, cradling it like a log as she carried it to an adjacent room.

She lowered it into a black tub, where several zoo workers held it still with a damp blue towel as blood samples were taken.

As they performed several tests to check hormone levels and verify its sex, it secreted a soapy film that smelled like pepper.

“It's like a protective measure,” reptile keeper Bekky Muscher-Hodges said as she looked into the vat. “Aren't they cute? They look like big, slimy Muppets.”

Keepers at the San Antonio Zoo moved the facility's seven salamanders Wednesday morning from the Wild Wonders exhibit to their new home at Kronkosky's Tiny Tot Nature Spot, where visitors, especially age 5 and younger, can have an eye-level view.

One salamander currently is on loan to the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha.

The salamanders can grow up to 60 pounds and 5 feet in length. The second largest salamander in the world, they are listed as near-threatened on the World Conservation Union's Red List of Threatened Species.

They eat fish, squid and shrimp, but can go for long periods without food.

Senior staff veterinarian Rob Coke said the San Antonio Zoo has the oldest captive group of its size in the nation.

“It was an opportune time to get their health checks,” Coke said, “and make sure they don't have any diseases.”

Coke said the results would be formulated into a normal data base for use in the United States

The salamanders, four females and three males, were hatched in 1990. They were a gift from Kumamoto, San Antonio's sister city in Japan, in 1999.

The salamanders are some of the last animals moved from the Wild Wonders exhibit, which will close permanently.

The area will be the site of the new Zootennial Plaza, slated to be completed in 2014, commemorating the zoo's 100-year anniversary.

For the ride to their nearby new home, the workers wrapped the salamanders in damp towels and slid them into separate, 3-foot long coolers.

They drove them over to the Nature Spot, once a popular boat ride attraction. They lowered them into the rock-filled tank in a large net, where they slid into the water without a splash, snug among the stones and shadows.

Police in north China's Tianjin Municipality confirmed that 20 rare birds were found dead and another 13 poisoned in the city's wetlands tainted by highly-toxic pesticide.

The birds that have been poisoned are not in life-threatening conditions, police added.

The birds, Oriental white storks, stopped at the city's Beidagang Wetland Nature Reserve along their migratory route when they were poisoned by the wetland water, media reports said Sunday.

Police said the water was confirmed to have contained carbofuran, also known as furadan, one of the most toxic carbamate pesticides, according to the Beijing News.

The remains and poisoned birds were discovered after an amateur photographer found the dead body of a stork on Nov. 11, and other kinds of birds have also been found dead.

Local authorities are diluting the tainted water and looking for the sources of the pesticide.

The Oriental white stork is listed under China's highest level of animal protection, as only 2,500 to 3,000 of them currently exist in the country. The species, which usually reproduces in the northeast, migrate south for winter, and the Beidagang Wetland is an important habitat along their migratory route.","20 rare birds dead, 13 poisoned in tainted wetlands",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHA6Ly93d3cuY2hpbmEub3JnLmNuL2Vudmlyb25tZW50LzIwMTItMTEvMTkvY29udGVudF8yNzE1MjU5OS5odG3SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/site1007/20121119/00114320db411213eabf29.jpg,2012-11-19,"{'sent': 'An oriental white stork is found dead by the wetland water at Beidagang Weland Nature Reserve, Tianjin, Nov. 12, 2012.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Beidagang Weland Nature Reserve'], 'GPE': ['Tianjin']}}","An oriental white stork is found dead by the wetland water at Beidagang Weland Nature Reserve, Tianjin, Nov. 12, 2012.

Indeed, the West African manatee is one of the most curious and least known animals on earth.

But pressures from coastal development mean it is shrinking in numbers – the estimate is by ten per cent a year – and over its huge range may now number no more than 10,000. A proposal from Senegal, Benin and Sierra Leone would stop all trade in its meat and its oil, for which it is being hunted.

0,"From polar bears and butterflies to the West African manatee and all manner of stingrays, the fate of many creatures is being debated in Bangkok this week, as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) updates its list of endangered animals. Described by secretary-general John E. Scanlon as the place where “the rubber hits the road,” the conference is a unique forum in which each animal becomes a case study in economics, conservation, and especially diplomacy, with all the horse-trading and back-scratching that typically involves. The National Post’s Joseph Brean takes a look at the main points of contention.

Polar Bear (Ursus Maritimus)

Russia and the United States are not famously cooperative. But a joint proposal to add the polar bear to the list of species who are so endangered that international trade in their parts is banned has caught the attention of the conference, not least the Canadian delegation, who oppose it vigorously. Canada is the source of pretty much all the legal international trade in polar bear pelts. Russia, in which bears are commonly poached and sold with bogus Canadian papers, previously opposed this same move by the U.S. in 2010, but has now come around to the American view that urgent protection is needed.

The Inuit oppose this as a threat to their tourism industry, in which hunting permits for polar bears bring in $20,000 each, and pelts can be sold for $5,000 or more. In all, around 600 bears are taken each year, out of a Canadian population of perhaps 15,000, in 19 population groups. Terry Audla, head of Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, told Reuters his people have been “very active participants in the management and when it comes to the harvest of bears, it’s based on sustainable levels that would not in any way (have) an impact on the populations and the health of the populations.”

The CITES secretariat also opposes the American proposal, and recommends polar bears stay in the second-tier of protection, with only licensed trade permitted, because there is “insufficient evidence to show that the species has undergone a marked decline in the population size in the wild.”

Even the World Wildlife Fund opposes the proposal, along with other environmental groups, as the threat of hunting is small compared to that of reduced sea ice due to climate change. A controversial compromise from the EU was tabled on Tuesday, asking Canada to simply report export numbers, but was shouted down, with a final vote expected Wednesday. If it passes, a 90-day clock will start after which it will be illegal to export polar bear parts, although the domestic hunt would continue.

White Rhinoceros (Cerato simum simum)

Thailand is known as a hub for the illegal trade in animal parts, including the laundering of poached African ivory through Thailand’s legal domestic market. Rhinoceros horn is similarly prized, typically for folk medicinal purposes in China, and under a Kenyan proposal, the White Rhino — famously hunted and killed in Ernest Hemingway’s Green Hills of Africa — would be elevated to the highest protection level, for populations in South Africa and Swaziland. CITES opposes this, preferring to leave them at Appendix II, which allows a trade in White Rhino trophies, but only under strict state management. A full ban “would prevent South Africa and Swaziland from using a management option that can be sustainable and beneficial for the conservation of the species; discourage the involvement of private landowners in the conservation of white rhinoceroses and undermine national and local rhino management strategies,” CITES said, noting that SA in particular has taken significant steps to improve its rhino hunting industry, which has benefitted the population at large, although the rhinos who got shot obviously did not share this benefit. Greater love hath no rhino than this, than he lay down his life for his friends.

West African Manatee (Trichechus senegalensis)

Also known unglamorously as the seacow, the West African Manatee is a warm-water herbivore (with an occasional hankering for shellfish) whose range extends, via river systems, into the troubled uplands of West Africa, where it is threatened by war, poaching, pollution, hydro dams, and accidental catch in fishing nets. The problem with the proposal to bump the West African Manatee into the most protected category — put forth by Benin, Senegal and Sierra Leone — is that there really is not an international market for them or their parts. With no tusks, there is no obvious trophy, and although it is technically edible, few would go out of their way to import it. A news report in Florida, about eating manatee illegally, described it as “fork tender but not fatty, just a touch of gristle,” with a taste comparable to tuna, buffalo, or possum. CITES recommends the proposal be rejected.

Oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus)

Other than perhaps whales — which are the subject of much CITES diplomacy when Japan seeks support for its Southern Ocean hunt, under the banner of “research” — sharks are the species that evoke the greatest popular outrage. This is largely because of the practice of “finning,” in which fins are cut from the backs of live sharks, and their bodies thrown back into the ocean, where they cannot swim and therefore die. The fins are then dried, reconstituted in water, and used in a Chinese banquet soup in which the fin’s cartilage adds a rich, gloopy texture to a chicken-based broth of ginger, sherry, mushrooms and other seafood. This is controversial, and local governments across Canada have enacted bans.

CITES calls the Oceanic whitetip shark an “overexploited species” and “one of the few species in trade with a specific marketing category used by major fin traders,” and supports a proposal from Brazil, Colombia, and the United States to include the shark in Appendix II, with a strictly licensed trade, delayed 18 months to resolve technical and administrative issues.

Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius)

Not all endangered species are animals. Some are plants, such as ginseng, widely used as a restorative and immune system booster, and an important product in the alternative medicine industry. A slow-growing perennial, it grows in the wild only in North America and the cooler parts of northwest Asia. Under a US proposal, its listing in Appendix II would be amended to clarify that trade in the wild plant is strictly licensed, but there is an exception for “manufactured parts or derivatives such as powders, pills, extracts, tonics, teas and confectionery.”

Memento Mori

As in the Oscars, the CITES conference includes a ceremonial nod to all those who have gone before us. This year, several apparently extinct species are likely to be struck forever from the record books of conservation, including the Tasmanian Tiger, the Laughing Owl, the Crescent nailtail wallaby, the Buff-nosed rat-kangaroo, the Pig-footed bandicoot, the Guadalupe caracara, and the Southern gastric-brooding frog.

Not all endangered species are animals. Some are plants, such as ginseng, widely used as a restorative and immune system booster, and an important product in the alternative medicine industry. A slow-growing perennial, it grows in the wild only in North America and the cooler parts of northwest Asia. Under a US proposal, its listing in Appendix II would be amended to clarify that trade in the wild plant is strictly licensed, but there is an exception for “manufactured parts or derivatives such as powders, pills, extracts, tonics, teas and confectionery.”

Memento Mori

As in the Oscars, the CITES conference includes a ceremonial nod to all those who have gone before us. This year, several apparently extinct species are likely to be struck forever from the record books of conservation, including the Tasmanian Tiger, the Laughing Owl, the Crescent nailtail wallaby, the Buff-nosed rat-kangaroo, the Pig-footed bandicoot, the Guadalupe caracara, and the Southern gastric-brooding frog.

0,"Paris - Scientists on Tuesday made a rare live addition to the order of primates, unveiling two new species of mouse lemur - tiny, big-eyed animals that inhabit the forests of Madagascar.

The find brings to 20 the known tally of mouse lemurs, nocturnal tree-dwellers that weigh less than a large apple.

Yet even as the two minute animals were recorded in the book of life, the scientists warned that one of them was teetering on the brink of extinction.

Primates are the well-studied family of mammals that includes humans, apes and monkeys, and the addition of new, living species to the list is rare.

Biologists from the US, Germany and Madagascar compared DNA, body mass and length, skull and tooth size and coat colouring to declare

andto be separate species and to usher them into clan of mouse lemurs.

With a body length of about 13.5cm

is now the largest of the known mouse lemurs. Adding its bushy tail, it is all of 28cm long and tips the scales at 78g.

The brownish primate has relatively large hind feet but small ears, and was named after the Marohita forest in eastern Madagascar where it was discovered, the team wrote in the International Journal of Primatology.

Marohita means ""many views"" in Malagasy.

Its cousin,

, also falls on the large side of the mouse lemur scale, with a nose-to-tail length of about 27cm and a weight of 51.5g.

Discovered in Madagascar's southeast Anosy region,

has a reddish head, with brown fur, a lighter-coloured belly, and a stripe along the spine.

The animals were discovered in 2003 and 2007, but it has taken years to formally identify them as a separate species. They probably escaped notice as they are outwardly similar to other mouse lemurs.

The team warned in their study that the Marohita forest has been ""seriously fragmented and destroyed"" since its namesake lemur was discovered there 10 years ago.

""Thus despite its species name, this mouse lemur is threatened by ongoing habitat destruction and 'many views' of its members are unlikely.""

The team wants the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to add

to its Red List of threatened animals, and sayswas likely to follow the same route.

""Field studies and additional regional surveys are... urgently needed to determine at least the geographic range and population status of these newly described species so that appropriate conservation measures can be implemented.""

The IUCN says Madagascar's lemurs are among the most endangered animals on Earth, with 91% of the 100-odd species and subspecies threatened with extinction.

Deforestation and poaching are the main threats to lemur survival in the Indian Ocean country plagued by political instability since a coup in 2009.

The island nation has lost some 11 million hectares of its forest cover in the last 20 years, according to the IUCN.

In a report last year, the agency said the rarest lemur, the northern sportive lemur, was down to 19 known individuals.

Due to Madagascar's geographical isolation, all of the island's primates are endemic, as are 90% of its plants and 80% of its amphibians and reptiles.

0,"Australia is famous for its natural beauty: the Great Barrier Reef, Uluru, Kakadu, the Kimberley. But what about the places almost no one goes? We asked ecologists, biologists and wildlife researchers to nominate five of Australia’s unknown wonders.

Christmas Island is a dot in the Indian Ocean. Like any isolated island, it is peculiar. But here this peculiarity is especially pronounced. It has a strange history, an odd culture and a remarkably distinctive biodiversity. Unfortunately, it is now best known to Australians simply as an entry point for refugees. Remoteness has that effect, of distorting truth and value.

Christmas Island is small (about 135km2) and little-populated (about 2,000 permanent residents). It has been settled only since the 1880s; for much of the period since then it was administered by the Straits Settlement (Singapore), with inclusion as an Australian territory only since 1958. Phosphate mining was the reason for its settlement, and has persisted as the main (sometimes only) industry ever since, leading to loss of about 25% of the Island’s rainforest area.

Reflecting that history, its ethnic make-up is now mainly Chinese and Malay (arising from workers imported as “coolies”). The small community is remarkably vibrant and tolerant: there can’t be any other place in Australia with two public holidays per year celebrating Christian holy days, two for Muslim holy days and two for Chinese festivals.

The call to prayer rings out over the community from the small mosque; everyone is welcome at the Chinese festivals.

Christmas Island is old. It is a volcanic seamount island, rugged and isolated, rising more than 4km from the deep sea floor, with the nearest land being Java, about 360km distant. Over the long period of its isolation, these features have crafted a unique environment. It is characterised by high levels of endemism for many groups and idiosyncratic ecological structuring.

Most of its reptiles, native mammals, and terrestrial birds occur (or occurred) nowhere else; and nearly 200 invertebrate species are considered endemic. There are very few areas in Australia (indeed, in the world) that can match such narrow endemism.

ChrisSurman/Christmas Island Tourism Association archives

It is also a haven for seabirds, recognised internationally for such significance. It is the only breeding site for the threatened Abbott’s Booby and Christmas Island Frigatebird, and for the exquisitely beautiful golden-coloured subspecies of White-tailed Tropicbird (which graces the Island’s flag). These seabirds and others soar and float above the settlement, and nest in and around it. Fringing the Island is a rich coral reef, and its clear warm waters are home to more than 600 fish species, with regular visits by Whale Sharks.

These values would readily meet World Heritage criteria. But, except among some twitchers, keen to visit to build their Australian bird lists, these attributes are little known to most Australians. Instead, Christmas Island’s nature is known, if at all, mainly by reference to its land crabs. In staggering abundance, diversity and ecological potency, these are indeed remarkable.

Christmas Island Tourism Association archives

The endemic Red Crab is the most conspicuous, with a population of at least 40 million. It is the Island’s ecological lynchpin, engineering the forest structure and productivity. It is everywhere; but spectacularly so in its annual breeding migration from forest to sea, when the forest floor, roads and gardens become moving masses of crab: one of the world’s great animal migrations.

JustinGilligan/Christmas Island Tourism Association archives

There are many other land crab species present, but none more strangely charismatic and enigmatic than the Robber (or Coconut) Crab, the world’s largest terrestrial invertebrate. This species, growing up to four kilograms, was formerly abundant on many other islands, but has been greatly reduced or lost from most places, and Christmas Island now represents its major stronghold.

For the Robber Crab and other species, laws, large areas of retained native vegetation, limited human population, and a large national park (comprising 63% of the Island area) offer unusual levels of protection. But problems for Christmas Island’s biodiversity are more insidious and deep-rooted.

Reflecting the dominance of the phosphate mining industry over its settled area (and consequential disregard for its natural values), the Island has had little or no quarantine or biosecurity system. It has been the fate of most islands worldwide, with impacts often pronounced and fatal because of small island size (and consequently small and tenuous populations of endemic species). Once the isolation that has moulded the biota is breached, that biodiversity may be doomed.

Now, the Island supports nearly as many introduced as native species, and the introduced species include many of the world’s most pernicious invaders.

The most problematic is the Yellow Crazy Ant. Fuelled in part by resources provided by super-abundant invasive scale insects, it forms immense supercolonies within which all Red Crabs (and much other biodiversity) are destroyed.

Invasive Giant Centipedes, Giant African Landsnails, geckoes and Wolf Snakes compete with or consume native species.

JustinGilligan/Christmas Island Tourism Association archives

Such loss in turn disrupts the narrowly-based ecological functionality, leading to “invasional meltdown” or ecological collapse. The most recent manifestation of this collapse, in 2009, was the extinction of the Christmas Island Pipistrelle (reducing the original complement of five endemic mammal species to just one species known to have persisted). Others will follow: the Christmas Island Forest Skink is known now from only one individual, eking out its solitary existence in a cage.

These problems are being addressed, by intensive and extensive baiting which temporarily reduces the number of crazy ants, by captive breeding for two endemic reptile species now almost lost from the wild, and by research that aims to find more enduring and effective methods for control of some of the pests and weeds. But the challenge is immense.

This is a most remarkable isolated world. In such a small place there is so much that is unique, inspiring and wonderful. It has existed little changed for millions of years; but its natural environment is now dissolving at a rapid rate. It will bring you much delight and sorrow.

The mysterious object was found by Scott C. Warin of UFO Sightings Daily

He suspects Nasa may be placing animals from inside the rover onto Mars

In May, another blogger claimed to have a spotted a lizard meandering around Mars

Is this proof of life on Mars or just an oddly shaped rock?

According to several UFO websites, the image is in fact a fossilised iguana on the Martian surface.



The mysterious object was first spotted by UFO Sightings Daily who uncovered the photograph in Nasa’s archives.

The mysterious object (left) was first spotted by UFO Sightings Daily who uncovered the photograph in Nasa’s archives. They claim that it could be a fossilised iguana



It would be easy to miss, but the keen eye of Scott Warin, who owns the site, was able to spot the iguana rock in photos taken by the Mars Curiosity rover.

‘This is not the first animal found on Mars, actually there have been about 10-15 to date,’ Mr Warring told news site agoracosmopolitan.com.

‘I even found a rock that moved four times in four photos...then vanished on the fifth.’

This iguana-shaped rock is seen on the top right of this image. It would be easy to miss, but the keen eye of Scott C. Warin, was able to spot the iguana rock in several photos taken by the Mars Curiosity rover

In May, a science blogger claimed to have spotted a lizard meandering around Mars.



The unknown spotter from Japan alerted Mr Warin of the unusual sight.



The claim, posted on UFO Sightings Daily, caused some excitable conspiracy theorists to fear that Nasa could be planting life on the planet for scientific testing.



'With water existing on Mars in small amounts, it’s possible to find such desert animals wandering around...although very rare mind you,’ Mr Waring wrote on his site.



Unusual: A science blogger with a keen eye claims to have spotted a lizard meandering around Mars

Is this proof of life on Mars or just an oddly shaped rock?

According to several UFO websites, the image is in fact a fossilised iguana on the Martian surface.



The mysterious object was first spotted by UFO Sightings Daily who uncovered the photograph in Nasa’s archives.

It would be easy to miss, but the keen eye of Scott Warin, who owns the site, was able to spot the iguana rock in photos taken by the Mars Curiosity rover.

‘This is not the first animal found on Mars, actually there have been about 10-15 to date,’ Mr Warring told news site agoracosmopolitan.com.

‘I even found a rock that moved four times in four photos...then vanished on the fifth.’

In May, a science blogger claimed to have spotted a lizard meandering around Mars.



The unknown spotter from Japan alerted Mr Warin of the unusual sight.



The claim, posted on UFO Sightings Daily, caused some excitable conspiracy theorists to fear that Nasa could be planting life on the planet for scientific testing.



'With water existing on Mars in small amounts, it’s possible to find such desert animals wandering around...although very rare mind you,’ Mr Waring wrote on his site.

0,"On a recent November afternoon, a white-naped crane named Walnut squawks loudly, then juts her long neck back and forth, mimicking the movement of an animal keeper nearby.

The hand-raised crane has come a long way since she arrived at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) in 2004. Then 24 years old, she had never been able to breed due to her close relationship with people. In fact, when she tried to breed naturally at other facilities, she killed two male cranes in the process.

But SCBI staff have been able to use artificial insemination to help Walnut produce six chicks since she arrived.

Walnut is just one success story of the institute, a 3,200-acre (1,290-hectare) campus among the rolling hills and hayfields of Front Royal, Virginia (map).

As a home for the nearly extinct, SCBI welcomes endangered animals from all over the world so their species might be saved. Twenty-one species of birds and mammals live on campus. (Related: ""Pictures of Nearly Extinct Species."")

The institute leads conservation efforts for the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., and other sites around the world. Its Center for Species Survival focuses on studying and breeding rare species and, in some cases, supporting efforts to reintroduce them back into the wild.

Although SCBI has been doing this work for nearly four decades, it's needed now more than ever, experts say.

""Every day we are seeing the loss of species and the habitat these plants and animals are dependent on for their survival,"" says Paul Marinari, the institute's senior curator of animal operations.

Stuart Pimm, president of the group SavingSpecies and a conservation ecologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, says that places like SCBI are truly the last hope for some species.

""The first thing we should be doing is protecting species in the wild, in their habitats. But the reality is, for some species, the only thing we can do is to keep it in captivity. And then, with luck and with time and with opportunity, we can put them back in the wild,"" says Pimm, who has no affiliation with the center.

""This is a difficult, last-ditch effort to save species, but sometimes we don't have any other alternatives.""

For the Birds

Before these grounds were a refuge for rare species, they served as a U.S. Army remount depot.

Driving around the campus, Marinari pointed out an old stallion barn where the military readied horses and mules for war efforts during the first half of the last century. He says that the area was later used as a detention facility for hundreds of German and Italian prisoners of war. The stone walls they built are still scattered around the campus today.

Along a winding road not far from one of these walls live groups of hooded, red-crowned, and white-naped cranes—one of the largest crane collections in North America. Among the most endangered bird species in the world, cranes are threatened by habitat loss.

Zoos from all over the continent send their most difficult cranes—those with behavioral and physical problems, many of whom have never been able to breed—here. Because the cranes have never reproduced, often they are the most genetically valuable of their species.

""You want to make sure that every single individual passes on its genetic material,"" Marinari says. (Learn more about the role zoos play in conservation.)

Another rare bird species, the mammal-like New Zealand brown kiwi, lives in a series of burrows that weave in and out of a nearby building. Warren Lynch, a supervisory biologist who began his career at SCBI as a volunteer 20 years ago, helped coax one of the nocturnal animals out of its burrow, but the unhappy bird quickly moved underground to go back to sleep.

Not yet considered endangered, the brown kiwi population is estimated to be less than 25,000, a stark difference from the millions that once existed.

Since little is known about the flightless birds, biologists here are studying their reproductive cycles to determine whether they are seasonal breeders.

Once a species becomes extinct in the wild, Marinari says, the lack of genetic diversity among animals that remain makes it difficult to do research.

""The time when you want to do basic science is when you don't only have a few left,"" he says. (Watch video: ""Should We Resurrect Extinct Species?"")

But funding for this work is an ongoing struggle. In 2001, the center was threatened with being shut down, and budget cuts in more recent years have led to a lack of resources.

Last week, the death of a young Przewalski's horse at SCBI—which followed the deaths of an antelope, gazelle, and red river hog earlier this year at the National Zoo—sparked concerns about the welfare of Smithsonian's animals. (Related: ""National Zoo Deaths: 'Circle of Life' or Animal Care Concerns?"")

Dennis Kelly, director of the National Zoo, told the Washington Post that budget uncertainties and a thinly stretched staff may have contributed to the incidents. ""We take every concern seriously and have protocols and processes in place to evaluate and update our management techniques,"" the zoo said in a statement.

Kingfisher Rebound

SCBI's bird collection started in 1975. Nine years later, two endangered Micronesian kingfishers were brought here after their population dropped to just a few dozen animals due to predation by the invasive brown tree snake. (Related: ""Heads Up to Invasive Pests: Poison Mice Falling From the Sky.)

In the two decades afterward, the worldwide kingfisher population stayed under 60—all in captivity—but now, thanks to breeding efforts, the population is steadily increasing.

Today there are an estimated 124 Micronesian kingfishers alive, five of which live at the Front Royal facility. If the trend continues, scientists may begin to reintroduce the species back into the wild.

But if a species has gone extinct in the wild once, what's to keep it from going extinct again? ""Circumstances can change,"" says Pimm, who is also a contributor to National Geographic's News Watch blog.

For instance, in the case of the kingfisher, its habitat may be a bit less threatened now than in the 1970s: The U.S. government is killing many of the invasive snakes by air-dropping dead mice stuffed with Tylenol, which is toxic to the reptiles.

""In the case of some animals, better protection [of their habitat] gives those animals a chance to make it back.""

Hope for the Oryx

One of those animals may be the scimitar-horned oryx of northern Africa. Declared extinct in the wild in 2000 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are fewer than 2,000 of these antelopes in the world, most of which live in captivity, according to Budhan Pukazhenthi, a reproductive physiologist at SCBI.

But ongoing research may make it possible for this species to eventually return to and thrive in its native lands.

For instance, SCBI was among the first to successfully breed scimitar-horned oryx via artificial insemination, and its scientists are beginning to experiment with how to mate the large mammal naturally. (Related: ""First Przewalski's Horse Born Via Artificial Insemination."")

SCBI is also launching a new initiative in conjunction with Conservation Centers for Species Survival—a group of five centers that collectively manage more than 25,000 acres (10,000 hectares) dedicated to endangered species—called the big-herd scenario.

""We are trying to look at the pros and cons of breeding these animals in small groups, one on one, versus having a large herd system, which is natural to their social behavior,"" says Pukazhenthi. He expects that breeding in the herd will produce more oryx with better social skills at lowered costs.

The big unknown is understanding the genetics of individual oryx. ""We really don't know the true [bloodlines] of some of these animals,"" Pukazhenthi explains. ""We are launching a process where we can identify every individual in the population and we can then go back and reunite their pedigree, which will allow us to better manage the population for the future.""

Into the Wild

SCBI also recently entered a partnership to help reintroduce the scimitar-horned oryx back into Chad.

""We are talking about hundreds of animals being reintroduced in a short window,"" Pukazhenthi says.

The greater the number of animals reintroduced, the more likely they are to thrive, but drought, hunting, and competition from livestock could still threaten reintroduced oryx populations.

What's more, even for species considered successes, there can be setbacks, notes Marinari. For instance, some of the endangered black-footed ferrets raised at the institute and reintroduced back to their western U.S. habitats have been hit with disease.

""We meet these challenges head-on,"" he says, by adapting to the situation as it happens and learning as much as possible about the species and its threats.

Despite the risks, conservationists say trying to save rare species is a battle worth fighting.

""It's a profoundly ethical issue,"" says Duke's Pimm.

""Are we going to hand to our grandchildren a world that is much poorer in species than the one we inherited from our grandparents?""

0,"An Ethiopian wolf and pup

I stood in my room in bathing trunks, looking out over the lake 100 metres away, anticipating the feel of the cool water on my skin.

There was just one small problem: the large, male Anubis baboon blocking my door. He was being groomed by a female. I tapped on the glass and did a little theatrical cough. Our eyes locked. He rolled back his top lip to reveal incisors like daggers. I wanted my swim; he wanted his grooming. They say a baboon can rip a man’s arms out of his sockets. My swim, I decided, could wait.

The day before, I’d arrived from Addis Ababa at Bishangari Lodge in Ethiopia’s Oromiya region, on the shores of Langano, one of a series of lakes that run along the Rift Valley, five hours’ drive south of the capital.

Bishangari, with its eight lovely cabins (called godjos) set back from the lake in a forest of podocarpus and wild fig trees, was the country’s first upmarket lodge when it opened in 2002. Others sprang up in the far north, serving the vast majority of Ethiopia’s tourists, who tend to head to the Unesco sites of Lalibela, Axum and Gondar. But the south’s luxury travel potential remained untapped beyond Bishangari.

Until now. This year a $290-a-night eco-lodge will open in the gloriously wild Bale Mountains, five hours southeast of Bishangari, creating for the first time a southern circuit for luxury travellers in Ethiopia.

And it was this two-lodge experience that I had journeyed south to try. But that wasn’t going to happen if I couldn’t even get out of my room.

Eventually, the baboon moved away from the door and I tiptoed my way through the 40-strong troop, saying “good mornings” as I went, figs raining down on me like hailstones from the tree above. Can baboons snigger? Undoubtedly. I hadn’t encountered such bullying since school.

After my swim, I walked along the shore of the lake. In the shade of an acacia, I sat on a rock and watched a procession of birds wing past, like an avian superhighway – there are 450 species around the lake, eight of them endemic. Hemprich’s hornbills followed a huge black crowned crane, a lone pelican flapped noiselessly inches from the lake surface. There were northern carmine bee eaters and starlings like winged sapphires, each more vivid in colour than the last. A pied kingfisher hovered right in front of me, split the water with its razor beak, then came and sat on a branch above my head to eat its breakfast.

I walked into the forest, past the spring that gave the lodge its name (bishangari means clear, bubbling water in Oromo). A giant warthog crashed out of the bushes right in front of me. In the canopy, colobus monkeys, with their white beards and doleful eyes, like sad little old men, watched me pass. White-cheeked turacos clucked away. I came to a clearing, in which stood a dozen tukels, or houses, with conical thatched roofs and walls of mud. It was a scene probably little changed since the birth of Christ. Children ran up to me, grabbing my hands, rubbing at the pale skin, as if trying to wipe it off.

This is how lazy days are spent at Bishangari, its remoteness freeing you from any guilty sense that you should be doing anything other than immersing yourself in its tranquillity. After dinner, served in a thatched open-sided structure, and a couple of beers in the treehouse bar set in a 500-year-old ficus, there’s nothing else to do except lie in bed listening to the forest, as the guttural screams, rustling and grunting gradually fade into deep, sonorous silence.

Next day we headed southeast, across wide, expansive plains of barley and teff, the pale golden crop that forms Ethiopia’s staple bread, injera. Carts pulled by donkeys outnumbered the few vehicles on the road. Church-goers, wearing the traditional brilliant-white shama and carrying the beautifully embroidered umbrellas for which Ethiopians are renowned, were strolling along the jacaranda-lined road like Victorian seaside promenaders.

We pulled in at a dusty truck stop for lunch. Large yellow-tailed kites swooped down looking for scraps. A waiter poured water over our hands from a copper decanter, then brought out the injera, a grey dustbin-lid sized slab of it – essentially tablecloth and eating utensil, as well as food – on to which he splodged various chilli sauces, collectively known as wat, each a different colour, so that the whole thing looked like an artist’s palette. Then came the tibs, strips of beef coated in salt and deep-fried until crisp, which we grabbed with torn-off pieces of injera and dunked in the fiery sauces. Delicious.

The Harenna forest in Bale Mountains National Park

We hit the foothills of the Bale Mountains. Gone were the plains, replaced with Alpine-like meadows flecked with wild geraniums. Gone, too, were the umbrella-toting walkers, replaced by people on horseback, the animals richly caparisoned, male riders wearing taqiyahs, the women in niqabs – for we had crossed from predominantly Christian Ethiopia into its southern Muslim heartlands.

The tarmac road petered out, replaced with a dirt track. My ears popped. The trees disappeared. Then, too, the low sagebrush and St John’s wort. Clouds kissed the flat, barren, empty land. We were crossing the Sanetti Plateau, the roof of Africa – at 4,000 metres, the highest drivable road on the continent. Just an hour or so earlier we had been basking in Technicolor Africa; now we were shivering on a grey moon.

We parked and went for a walk, layered up against the chill wind, crunching on the permafrost, puffing hard in the thin air, weaving between small, oily tarns that sparkled like mirrors. We seemed to be walking through the most lifeless, uninhabited place on earth. On closer inspection, though, the ground was alive, black blurs scuttling everywhere, appearing and disappearing in the blink of an eye. These, as Endele Teshome, our guide, explained, were the giant mole rats and grass rats that thrive in the conditions up here.

“There! There!” Teshome said, pointing. Walking towards us, russet in the monochrome, was an endemic Ethiopian wolf. With only 450 surviving, 250 of them in the Bale Mountains National Park, it is one of the rarest mammals on the planet, driven to near-extinction by hunters and the rabies their dogs carry. My heart stopped. It was one of the most stunning animals I had ever seen.

“He’s out hunting,” Teshome said. He explained that the mole rat forms the wolf’s staple diet. So for the Ethiopian wolf, the site is an all-you-can-eat buffet. The wolf caught sight of us and disappeared behind some rocks. “Don’t worry,” Teshome said. “We will see more before the trip is out.”

We drove to the edge of the Sanetti escarpment. Far, far beneath us, stretching to the horizon, cloud forest so lush and viridescent that it hurt your eyes. This was the Harenna, the third-largest forest in Africa.

We descended through the low, gnarled trees, which were dripping with old man’s beard and ancient creepers, dense and foreboding like a forest from a Grimm fairytale.

The trees parted, and there was the Bale Mountain Lodge. Well, what will become the Bale Mountain Lodge. When I visited in December, it was still a building site, with work having fallen months behind schedule.

The brainchild of former British army colonel Guy Levene, the 18-bedroom luxury lodge will be the first to operate within an Ethiopian national park. Guy’s wife Yvonne told of the setbacks they had encountered, the frustrations and bureaucracy (Guy was in Addis Ababa trying to liberate building materials from customs).

She showed us around the one completed lodge, with hay-bale walls, hardwood floors and wood burner; and another, half-built, which is romantically reached via a staircase through the tangled roots of a giant tree, with a terrace overlooking the cloud forest and, looming above, the craggy peak of Mount Gujerale, a giant thumb hitching a lift in the sky. It was a stunning setting and easy to imagine how the Levenes lost their hearts when they first saw it in 2011.

We walked in the forest, alive with birdsong, the floor carpeted with purple acanthus, the 500-year-old schefflera trees festooned with traditional bamboo basket beehives for the honey the lodge will serve.

“We saw a big lion in this very spot last week,” Yvonne said. I picked up a stick. I’m not quite sure why.

Horse riding in the Web Valley

On the way back to Addis, we headed for the Web Valley in the national park, a two-hour drive off-road along hideously rutted tracks, once more leaving the trees behind as we climbed, the landscape now punctuated only by the spikes of giant lobelia. We camped outside the research hut of the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Project where, overnight, the temperature plunged to -10C. In the morning, we mounted horses (the wildlife is used to them, and doesn’t see the humans) and rode off across the frigid steppe, the surrounding mesas beginning to glow gently golden in the morning sun. It was like being in your own Sergio Leone movie.

The valley’s hunters were starting their day shift. A serval cat slunk across our path. The sky grew full of giant raptors – Verreaux’s, tawny and golden eagles, augur buzzards, kites, all as common here as pigeons in a city park. An Abyssinian hare ran across the ground at cartoon speed, as well it might. A group of handsome mountain nyalas, an antelope endemic to Bale, snorted, the frozen air sending great plumes of steam from their nostrils.

We rode until, in the late afternoon, we found our prey: there, 100 metres in front of us, in the rocks, was the entrance to an Ethiopian wolf den. Teshome explained how a wolf community works: how the adults all take responsibility for the pups; how they live as a pack but hunt during the day in solitude. Through binoculars, we watched as four tiny pups, about a month old, rare, precious bundles of fur, frolicked. A shadow flew across the lens. A tawny eagle landed inches from one of the pups. “They take young wolves,” Teshome said. I held my breath. The pup and eagle eyed each other.

A bark. We scanned left. There, striding through the gloaming under the infinite sky, was a big male. The eagle flew off. The pups ran to greet the returning adult, mobbing him, dancing around his feet. The wolf sat down, sniffed the air and then locked his eyes on us. He threw back his head, the plaintive, haunting howl echoing around the valley.

I stood in my room in bathing trunks, looking out over the lake 100 metres away, anticipating the feel of the cool water on my skin.

There was just one small problem: the large, male Anubis baboon blocking my door. He was being groomed by a female. I tapped on the glass and did a little theatrical cough. Our eyes locked. He rolled back his top lip to reveal incisors like daggers. I wanted my swim; he wanted his grooming. They say a baboon can rip a man’s arms out of his sockets. My swim, I decided, could wait.

The day before, I’d arrived from Addis Ababa at Bishangari Lodge in Ethiopia’s Oromiya region, on the shores of Langano, one of a series of lakes that run along the Rift Valley, five hours’ drive south of the capital.

Bishangari, with its eight lovely cabins (called godjos) set back from the lake in a forest of podocarpus and wild fig trees, was the country’s first upmarket lodge when it opened in 2002. Others sprang up in the far north, serving the vast majority of Ethiopia’s tourists, who tend to head to the Unesco sites of Lalibela, Axum and Gondar. But the south’s luxury travel potential remained untapped beyond Bishangari.

Until now. This year a $290-a-night eco-lodge will open in the gloriously wild Bale Mountains, five hours southeast of Bishangari, creating for the first time a southern circuit for luxury travellers in Ethiopia.

And it was this two-lodge experience that I had journeyed south to try. But that wasn’t going to happen if I couldn’t even get out of my room.

Eventually, the baboon moved away from the door and I tiptoed my way through the 40-strong troop, saying “good mornings” as I went, figs raining down on me like hailstones from the tree above. Can baboons snigger? Undoubtedly. I hadn’t encountered such bullying since school.

After my swim, I walked along the shore of the lake. In the shade of an acacia, I sat on a rock and watched a procession of birds wing past, like an avian superhighway – there are 450 species around the lake, eight of them endemic. Hemprich’s hornbills followed a huge black crowned crane, a lone pelican flapped noiselessly inches from the lake surface. There were northern carmine bee eaters and starlings like winged sapphires, each more vivid in colour than the last. A pied kingfisher hovered right in front of me, split the water with its razor beak, then came and sat on a branch above my head to eat its breakfast.

I walked into the forest, past the spring that gave the lodge its name (bishangari means clear, bubbling water in Oromo). A giant warthog crashed out of the bushes right in front of me. In the canopy, colobus monkeys, with their white beards and doleful eyes, like sad little old men, watched me pass. White-cheeked turacos clucked away. I came to a clearing, in which stood a dozen tukels, or houses, with conical thatched roofs and walls of mud. It was a scene probably little changed since the birth of Christ. Children ran up to me, grabbing my hands, rubbing at the pale skin, as if trying to wipe it off.

This is how lazy days are spent at Bishangari, its remoteness freeing you from any guilty sense that you should be doing anything other than immersing yourself in its tranquillity. After dinner, served in a thatched open-sided structure, and a couple of beers in the treehouse bar set in a 500-year-old ficus, there’s nothing else to do except lie in bed listening to the forest, as the guttural screams, rustling and grunting gradually fade into deep, sonorous silence.

Next day we headed southeast, across wide, expansive plains of barley and teff, the pale golden crop that forms Ethiopia’s staple bread, injera. Carts pulled by donkeys outnumbered the few vehicles on the road. Church-goers, wearing the traditional brilliant-white shama and carrying the beautifully embroidered umbrellas for which Ethiopians are renowned, were strolling along the jacaranda-lined road like Victorian seaside promenaders.

We pulled in at a dusty truck stop for lunch. Large yellow-tailed kites swooped down looking for scraps. A waiter poured water over our hands from a copper decanter, then brought out the injera, a grey dustbin-lid sized slab of it – essentially tablecloth and eating utensil, as well as food – on to which he splodged various chilli sauces, collectively known as wat, each a different colour, so that the whole thing looked like an artist’s palette. Then came the tibs, strips of beef coated in salt and deep-fried until crisp, which we grabbed with torn-off pieces of injera and dunked in the fiery sauces. Delicious.

A new attempt to create a hierarchy of the most threatened birds relies on an idea that measures ""evolutionary distinctiveness,"" and researchers have used it to list the world's 100 most unique and endangered birds.

Not all species are equal, the researchers contend, and evolutionary distinctiveness is a measure of how genetically or evolutionarily unique a species is. By using this as a measure, conservationists can focus their attention on saving species whose loss would serve as the greatest blow to species diversity and the history of evolution.

The scientists published their research in the journal Current Biology.

""Not all species are evolutionarily equal - some have few close relatives that share their DNA,"" said study co-author Gavin Thomas of the University of Sheffield. ""These species are irreplaceable. If they are driven to extinction, millions of years or evolutionary history goes with them.""

Some bird species, such as the Oilbird, have tens of millions of years of evolutionary history behind them, while other species only came into existence relatively recently. Many of these early-evolving birds do not have close living relatives, and should be given conservation priority, the researchers said.

""To date, conservation has emphasized the number of species, treating all species as equal,"" said lead study author Walter Jetz, a Yale University evolutionary biologist. ""But not all species are equal in their genetic or geographic rarity. We provide a framework for how such species information could be used for prioritizing conservation.""

There are nearly 10,000 living species of birds, and around 600 of them are at risk of becoming extinct as a result of human development pressures and changes to their environment.

Jetz said that conserving some of these endangered species is challenging because many of them live far away from areas that already receive environmental protection.

By applying evolutionarily distinctiveness ratings to the geographic ranges of all 9,993 living bird species, the researchers documented areas where maximum conservation of bird diversity could be achieved with minimal investment.

Notable target areas include regions of Australia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Madagascar, the researchers reported.

""In addition to targeted conservation, better monitoring of species' changing distributions is vital, and geographical conservation priorities can be effectively adjusted to better conserve the tree of life and the many important functions it provides,"" Jetz said. Jetz also leads the Map of Life project, which maps avian species distribution and range maps for evolutionarily distinct species.

By applying evolutionarily distinctiveness ratings to the geographic ranges of all 9,993 living bird species, the researchers documented areas where maximum conservation of bird diversity could be achieved with minimal investment.

Notable target areas include regions of Australia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Madagascar, the researchers reported.

""In addition to targeted conservation, better monitoring of species' changing distributions is vital, and geographical conservation priorities can be effectively adjusted to better conserve the tree of life and the many important functions it provides,"" Jetz said. Jetz also leads the Map of Life project, which maps avian species distribution and range maps for evolutionarily distinct species.

0,"A few years ago Los Angeles Zoo spent $42 million on a new, six-acre enclosure for Asian elephants. After several years of construction, the new facility opened amid a hail of publicity, with banners draped from streetlights across the city for weeks ahead of time, and a red-carpet cocktail reception for VIPs and celebrities on the big night. Proud zoo officials pointed out the waterfall and pond for the elephants to bathe in and shower themselves with, and an “enrichment log” where food is hidden. A pavilion evoking Thai architecture displayed conservation efforts and the ways visitor donations help elephants in the wild.

Despite such accoutrements, the zoo soon found itself in court defending accusations that the exhibit was inhumane. A judge later ruled that keepers can’t use electric prods on the animals, but stopped short of closing the exhibit.

The more scientists learn about animal behavior, the more zoos seem in conflict with zoology. And zoos’ original mission to exhibit animals is becoming an anachronism now that exotic beasts can be viewed at a click of a mouse and cable TV nightly provides more reliable game viewing than tourists typically get on $500-a-day safaris. Meanwhile, wildlife is in crisis: Between habitat destruction, poaching, and a host of other threats, populations are crashing and species are disappearing at a record clip. The historical rate of species extinction is about one in 1 million per year; today it’s one in 1,000, an increase by a factor of 1,000.

Yet if you ask leading scientists working in the field saving animals if zoos as a whole are doing enough for conservation, you'll get an emphatic no. Even some zoo directors admit they are failing the animals that are their raison d’être, as the main interface most people have with live undomesticated animals is fast becoming irrelevant, bearing about as much resemblance to the natural world as Disneyland has to Detroit. Zoos present wildlife as though tigers and sifakas were as plentiful as chipmunks and squirrels, though an honest re-creation of the situation in the wild would present visitors with a long walk through mostly empty space. A visit to a zoo can be an eerie and disconcerting experience for anyone who knows about the Anthropocene extinction crisis, like that of a hipster plopped down in Branson, Mo.

Zoos originated as displays of power by monarchs and existed mainly as such from ancient Egypt to Bourbon France. The Enlightenment saw the first use of captive animals for research (or what passed for research in those days), a practice that expanded during the Victorian era, with its fascination with exploring the natural world. The first zoos in the U.S. reflected this duality; one was in New York’s Central Park, near the mansions that were starting to go up along Fifth Avenue, and soon after the New York Zoological Society, today known as the Wildlife Conservation Society and a leader in conservation science, opened a zoo in the Bronx.

Considering their origin, it shouldn’t be surprising that zoos have not done more conservation. Also, boards of directors often consist of local rich guys who see the city zoo as a community resource—more similar to the symphony orchestra or the parks department than to the World Wildlife Fund. Zoos are complex organizations juggling a mix of responsibilities: caring for animals, ensuring the safety of visitors and staff, maintaining buildings and vehicles, entertaining three-year-olds, and not going broke—all, in many cases, while being accountable to local bureaucrats and politicians. Field biology is also complex and expensive, so on top of all this, it’s a big ask.

Perhaps the biggest hindrance to zoos’ greater involvement in stemming the extinction crisis is that when the news about wildlife is so frequently bad, it’s especially difficult to get the message of urgency to visitors who didn’t spend $50 to get bummed out on a Saturday. “People leave their homes, and the intent is not to save animals in Africa—it’s to have a family outing,” says Paul Boyle, senior vice president for conservation and education at the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the accrediting body for zoos in the U.S. and six other countries. “So we can’t fly in the face of that.”

Zoos are in a unique position to help. They can bring their knowledge to the field (and many do). They can raise money: Every year, 180 million people come through their doors—more people than attend every NFL, NBA, NHL, and MLB game combined—with their wallets already open. Anything from support for anti-poaching enforcement to programs to convince humans who share habitat with threatened wildlife the importance of preserving the animals would be welcome, say field conservationists. Yet at many zoos, Boyle says, only 1 percent of the budget goes to conservation. He says AZA is pushing members to get to 3 percent, but there’s no minimum required donation for AZA accreditation by the association. A boost to 10 percent would send $800 million a year to wildlife, which according to the Wildilfe Conservation Network and Jane Goodall Institute currently receives 0.1 percent of international philanthropy.

We lost over 35,000 elephants to poaching in 2013. If zoos can't help us, nobody can. Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder, Save the Elephants

Of more than 200 AZA-accredited zoos in the U.S., says Jean-Gaël Collomb, Ph.D., director of conservation programs at Wildlife Conservation Network (a Bay Area–based group that directly funds field conservationists through donations, not the operator of the Bronx Zoo), “I think maybe 40 might actually conceive of wildlife conservation the way I do: field-based, action-oriented wildlife conservation providing support to those in country trying to mitigate threats to their particular species. Many institutions, because they’re breeding an endangered animal, they think that’s conservation. To me that doesn’t necessarily contribute to protecting that animal in the wild. They think because they sent a zookeeper to the field, that’s supporting conservation. But you have no idea if that had any positive impact or whether they just went on a nice vacation. My personal opinion is that if you exhibit animals from all over the world, you have the responsibility to contribute to the conservation of all of those animals in the wild.”

What has changed since the 19th century—hell, since the 1980s—is that if somebody doesn’t do something fast, many of the zoos’ biggest draws will soon be extinct. Collomb says, “If animals disappear in the wild, it threatens the sustainability” of zoos’ exhibits, and therefore their very existence as currently constituted. The population of lions in the wild has fallen by half just since 2001. Cheetahs are critically endangered, and elephant, tiger, giant tortoise, and rhino poaching are out of control. Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants and a pioneering zoologist, said to me at a fund-raiser in Los Gatos, Calif., not long ago, “We lost over 35,000 elephants to poaching last year.” And 25,000 the year before that. “If zoos can’t help us, nobody can.”

In a ravine 3,300 feet above sea level in the Topatopa Mountains, about 25 miles east-northeast of Santa Barbara, a baby bird stood on a rock. This does not sound like such a big deal until you know that the bird was a California condor, and that 27 years earlier there were 22 specimens of the species alive. Anywhere. The San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo captured all those birds so they wouldn’t get killed along with all the others (poaching, lead and pesticide poisoning, power lines—the modern world has not been good to this prehistoric-looking species).

The plan was to breed the birds in captivity and reintroduce them into the wild, which the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the leader of the California Condor Recovery Program, did. But the first birds to be released, though they'd been raised for awhile by puppets resembling condors, didn’t go out into the world and act like condors; they were gallivanting about on people’s back patios, breaking screen doors, showing off for tourists at the Grand Canyon. There were bizarre reports of condors engaging in group sex and eating underwear. So the recovery plan shifted, and zoos began using puppets for a longer period, and releasing the young condors later.

This has been going quite well. The bird on the rock, #717, was the wild-hatched offspring of captive-bred parents who both hatched in 2001 in San Diego and were puppet-reared there. Today Estelle Sandhaus, director of conservation and research for the Santa Barbara Zoo, helps FWS oversee the wild condors. The Zoo is a privately owned facility of nearly 500 animals on 30 acres that saw about half a million visitors in 2013. It sets aside $5, or up to 9 percent, of every membership fee to field conservation, supporting the International Snow Leopard Trust and similar groups, in addition to its work on the recovery program.

Condors are some ugly-ass birds, but Sandhaus loves them. “I actually think they’re beautiful,” she said on the drive up through Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge to the Sespe Condor Sanctuary. It’s a severely restricted area of craggy, chaparral-covered hills that produce painterly shadows at dawn and dusk, a sliver of California that’s as close to its pre-Columbian environment as you are likely to find in the U.S.

“But there are a lot of other reasons to care about the condor,” Sandhaus continued. “Some people call them the mammals of the bird world.”

Condors raise their young for up to a year and a half—nearly unheard of among birds. They rely heavily on social learning, which is also highly unusual, and they play. Moreover, Sandhaus said, “a lot of us feel a responsibility to help recover them because much of their decline was human caused. They’re perfectly suited to this landscape as long as we get the toxins out of their environment.”

An hour later, we stood on a ridge above #717’s nest. Thermal columns the birds ride in their search for carrion were beginning to carry up the mountainside. A condor nest doesn’t consist of nesty stuff the parents have collected but is really just a cave, or sometimes even a rock or a portion of a rock up against a hillside or cliff wall.

Sandhaus brought me here because this site was critical to the discovery a few years ago that condors were dying after eating bits of trash. Some of the dead were young birds that hadn’t left the nest; it wasn't that they weren't adapting to life on their own—it was that their parents were feeding them stuff like bottle caps and pennies they brought home. (Condors travel up to 100 miles a day in search of food—well outside the boundaries of the wildlife refuge.) “Trash ingestion was the most important mortality factor in nestlings,” according to a published paper by San Diego Zoo Global's Bruce Rideout et al. in 2012.

After FWS, San Diego Zoo, and others identified the hidden killer, now known as microtrash, Santa Barbara Zoo became involved in managing nests to keep microtrash out. Zoo employees and volunteers set up observation blinds near the nests and climbed down into them—condors are not helicopter parents, and will leave the nest for days at a time, even when raising offspring, checking in via the occasional flyover—to see what was going on.

Microtrash was found in the nests, so the zoo began efforts to reduce through volunteer roadside cleanups the amount of trash available to them. (Why a bird would feed a piece of garbage to its young remains a mystery.) A favored local recreational activity known as “plinking”—area residents pull over from a mountain road and shoot small firearms at cans and bottles emptied of the beer they have been consuming—has resulted in a lot of microtrash collecting beside roads. The condors all wear radio tags (a technology first applied in wildlife conservation by Iain Douglas-Hamilton, incidentally), so when the zoo finds they are congregating by a turnout, volunteers head to the spot and pick up any microtrash they find. There’s also been a substantial education component, seeking to convince area residents to, among other things, clean up post-plinking. When FWS and Los Angeles Zoo staff rappelled with a TSA-issue metal detector into the canyon where #717 now lives, they found the baby had consumed microtrash. The little guy was kidnapped and helicoptered to Los Angeles Zoo, where veterinary surgeons removed the trash and stitched up the baby; officials from FWS returned it to its nest. The parents probably never noticed it was gone, but zoo volunteers continued to train a telescope on the bird postop to look for signs of infection.

“This discovery and action has been critical to the recovery program’s success,” said Santa Barbara Zoo conservation research coordinator Ria Boner. Before, just 6 percent of wild-hatched birds were living long enough to leave the nest; now it’s 62 percent. “And you can directly trace that to these interventions,” Boner said.

When they were first released, the birds were eating mostly food provided to them as part of the recovery program; scientists weren’t sure they’d seek carrion on instinct. Now they’re foraging on their own; some condors in Arizona never go to the provisioning areas at all (program officials can tell by the radio-collar data). “We’re starting to have new pairs breeding that didn’t grow up in the trash era, and one of them did not bring trash to the nest,” Sandhaus said.

Yes, getting zoos to do field conservation is a big ask. Yes, it’s hard, and it doesn’t always succeed right away. But it’s totally doable, even by the smallest zoos.

Santa Barbara Zoo is working in its own backyard, which is a way, said several wildlife biologists I spoke to, small zoos like it can make a significant contribution to wildlife.

Edward Louis of Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo is one wildlife biologist showing how bigger zoos, with more resources, can help in some of the world’s most threatened areas. Although he’s director of genetic research for a zoo in Nebraska, he spends 8­­–11 months a year in Madagascar. His programs study biodiversity and biogeography in unique and biologically diverse habitats threatened via multiple vectors, including population growth, political instability, and logging. The Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership is an NGO created out of Louis’ work, and it’s now a permanent, community-based organization working at four sites on the island to protect habitat by involving resident humans—who find themselves benefiting from the protection of what they had been destroying.

“All four sites had hunting going on,” said Louis when I reached him at his lab in Omaha. “We worked with another NGO to create a coloring and activity book about umbrella species in [the local language] and distribute copies to five areas with critically endangered lemurs.” It was just a spiral notebook and a pack of crayons, but it got local kids to convince their parents to stop hunting. “Now there’s pretty much no hunting at any of the sites.”

Connecting habitat fragmented by logging, agriculture, and urbanization so that secretive lemurs can thrive is another challenge. The rainforest has been a resource for locals going back centuries; that only became a problem when people started living longer on average, placing more pressure on the resource, and multinational corporations swooped in to harvest timber for sale overseas.

Louis’ program has planted 40,000 trees to connect fragments of habitat for the black and white ruffed lemur, a critically endangered species that eats almost nothing but fruit and disperses seeds through its scat. The notion that these animals should therefore be protected as a means of preserving and growing the forest “was an easy message to sell to local people,” Louis said. One population of the species has risen from 30 to 100 since 2009 as a result of his and his colleagues’ efforts, with another 20 surviving to their second year in 2012, Louis reported hopefully. (The organization has also been responsible for the naming of an astonishing 21 new lemur species.)

His zoo-supported NGO further works with government to establish land rights: Together they approach local farmers and offer them title to the land, which many subsistence farmers across sub-Saharan Africa and other underdeveloped areas of the globe don’t have, sometimes resulting in quasi-legal “land grabs” by multinationals and corrupt or unscrupulous government officials. The farmers must agree in return to plant trees on half their land as permanent forest, plant 35 percent of the acreage for harvestable timber, and plant 15 percent for commercial crops and fruit trees. Other locals are paid to plant trees with vouchers they can trade in for low-polluting, high-efficiency stoves, which obviate their need to cut down the forest while promoting health and wealth. Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership is also installing photovoltaic arrays at schools to power fans it’s buying for them. Help people want to help habitat is the idea; the group’s motto is “It’s all connected.”

Louis is among those field conservationists who think zoos should be doing more. This needn’t involve forming partnerships with local governments in faraway, unstable countries, and it doesn’t require the decades-long process of reintroducing species on the verge of extinction into the wild. Zoos already have expertise field biologists can use.

Zoos “ought to have to spend 10 percent of their budget on in situ conservation,” said Edward Louis, director of genetic research at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums' member organizations collectively contribute 89 cents per visitor. Parking at SeaWorld costs $16.

Colleen Begg of the Niassa Lion Project in Mozambique gushed to me about the help she gets from the Houston Zoo. The national park where she works has villages within its borders that predate the park’s formation, and convincing residents to care about lions is a significant challenge. Her partners from Houston “know how to engage people,” she said. “Their enviro education, signage—they’ve been critical at educating our community” about the potential benefits of living amid biodiversity. “And this can spread to other zoos. There’s no reason a zoo can't find a field conservationist it can support.”

Zoos “ought to have to spend 10 percent of their total budget on in situ conservation to get accredited,” Louis said. AZA’s Boyle and the AZA communications official I corresponded with kept telling me that member organizations collectively contribute $160 million annually to field conservation. I thought that sounded like a big number, but then I remembered another big number they’d given me: 180 million visitors a year. So $160 million breaks down to 89 cents per visitor. Parking at SeaWorld—parking—costs $16.

Then I headed over to the Wildlife Conservation Society website and downloaded its annual report. In the last fiscal year $86 million went to global conservation programs. That means more than half the money AZA members spend on conservation comes from one organization.

“My focus is to maintain habitat for these animals; I don’t want to have to bring them into captivity,” said Louis. “The northern sportive lemur, there were only 19 left. Now we have 48, but we lost some forest over the summer. In 10 years everything is gonna be gone, including the species, unless we do something locally.”

When my older daughter was a little past her first birthday, my wife and I realized she hadn’t been to the zoo yet. Just before Ericka’s pregnancy we spent two weeks observing wildlife in Botswana, where I’d spent some time after college doing conservation work. After walking beside wild elephants and watching a leopard eat its prey, we weren’t eager to view animals in captivity. But we figured that was our issue; a kid ought to go to the zoo.

At the giraffe exhibit, a baby giraffe nuzzled its mother along the neck; Vivian, held by her own mother, mimicked the gesture. When we turned a corner and the elephant exhibit came into view, Vivian’s jaw dropped. She’d seen pictures of elephants and owned a plastic elephant toy, but I realized only at that moment that she’d had no idea the animals were that size. One showered itself with its trunk, and Vivian, who knew a little sign language, started to make the sign for water. She was so transfixed she couldn’t complete the motion. “Wa…,” she said. She was dumbfounded.

Do zoos matter? Should they even exist? Some would like to see the practice of exhibiting animals for our amusement banned, and Costa Rica is planning to do just that.

Iain Douglas-Hamilton believes zoos still have a purpose, and given his CV, it’s hard to argue with him: His use of radio tracking is now routine for field conservationists (while he’s continued to innovate). Data he collected in the 1980s, along with his subsequent political efforts, make him the single person most responsible for the worldwide ban on ivory trading. At 72, he's still working on multiple fronts to help end the current crisis.

“I’m very well aware of the downside of maintaining elephants in captivity,” he told me. “An elephant with a small range lives in an area of 100 square kilometers, and a zoo at best can have just a few acres. But many people can’t afford to come on safari. I don’t think some people appreciate the importance of the effect zoos can have in the lives of normal people to bring them to love animals. Zoos can be a conduit for sharing the sense of wonder and understanding of animals that I have.”

Two days before this article published, I received a letter at my home from Los Angeles Zoo, of which I am a member. “Your gift will change the future for elephants,” promised the envelope. The appeal within told the story of Mshale, an African elephant who had been attacked by poachers four times (and about whom I’d commissioned an article last month). It went on to tell about 96 Elephant s.org , a new WCS and AZA program focusing on the demand side of the slaughter.

Then it asked me to “make a donation by June 30th to support Los Angeles Zoo…where we will continue our work…nurturing [the elephants in the $42 million exhibit], as well as supporting initiatives in Asia to mitigate human/elephant conflicts….”

It didn’t ask for a donation to the Elephant Crisis Fund, Douglas-Hamilton’s new effort, which spends 100 percent of its funds combatting poaching, trafficking, and demand; it didn’t even ask for a donation to 96Elephants.org. It was leveraging the crisis wild African elephants now face to raise money for the maintenance of captive Asian elphants. “Support the Los Angeles Zoo,” and trust that we are helping wild elephants, it was essentially saying.

Time will tell whether efforts like L.A. Zoo’s, whatever they may be, will be enough. But time is something African elephants don’t have much of. The success or failure of such efforts, and whether or not more zoos will get more involved, may determine whether zoos themselves become museums of natural history.","When You Walk Into a Zoo, Are You Helping Animals or Hurting Them?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGFrZXBhcnQuY29tL2ZlYXR1cmUvMjAxNC8wNS8wMi9kby16b29zLW1hdHRlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/AP557118530424-promo.jpg,2014-05-02,"{'sent': 'A few years ago Los Angeles Zoo spent $42 million on a new, six-acre enclosure for Asian elephants.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Los Angeles Zoo'], 'MONEY': ['six-acre', '$42 million']}}","A few years ago Los Angeles Zoo spent $42 million on a new, six-acre enclosure for Asian elephants.

The Zoo is a privately owned facility of nearly 500 animals on 30 acres that saw about half a million visitors in 2013. It sets aside $5, or up to 9 percent, of every membership fee to field conservation, supporting the International Snow Leopard Trust and similar groups, in addition to its work on the recovery program.

Condors are some ugly-ass birds, but Sandhaus loves them. “I actually think they’re beautiful,” she said on the drive up through Hopper Mountain National Wildlife Refuge to the Sespe Condor Sanctuary. It’s a severely restricted area of craggy, chaparral-covered hills that produce painterly shadows at dawn and dusk, a sliver of California that’s as close to its pre-Columbian environment as you are likely to find in the U.S.

“But there are a lot of other reasons to care about the condor,” Sandhaus continued. “Some people call them the mammals of the bird world.”

Condors raise their young for up to a year and a half—nearly unheard of among birds. They rely heavily on social learning, which is also highly unusual, and they play. Moreover, Sandhaus said, “a lot of us feel a responsibility to help recover them because much of their decline was human caused. They’re perfectly suited to this landscape as long as we get the toxins out of their environment.”

An hour later, we stood on a ridge above #717’s nest. Thermal columns the birds ride in their search for carrion were beginning to carry up the mountainside. A condor nest doesn’t consist of nesty stuff the parents have collected but is really just a cave, or sometimes even a rock or a portion of a rock up against a hillside or cliff wall.

Sandhaus brought me here because this site was critical to the discovery a few years ago that condors were dying after eating bits of trash. Some of the dead were young birds that hadn’t left the nest; it wasn't that they weren't adapting to life on their own—it was that their parents were feeding them stuff like bottle caps and pennies they brought home. (Condors travel up to 100 miles a day in search of food—well outside the boundaries of the wildlife refuge.) “Trash ingestion was the most important mortality factor in nestlings,” according to a published paper by San Diego Zoo Global's Bruce Rideout et al. in 2012.

After FWS, San Diego Zoo, and others identified the hidden killer, now known as microtrash, Santa Barbara Zoo became involved in managing nests to keep microtrash out. Zoo employees and volunteers set up observation blinds near the nests and climbed down into them—condors are not helicopter parents, and will leave the nest for days at a time, even when raising offspring, checking in via the occasional flyover—to see what was going on.

Microtrash was found in the nests, so the zoo began efforts to reduce through volunteer roadside cleanups the amount of trash available to them. (Why a bird would feed a piece of garbage to its young remains a mystery.) A favored local recreational activity known as “plinking”—area residents pull over from a mountain road and shoot small firearms at cans and bottles emptied of the beer they have been consuming—has resulted in a lot of microtrash collecting beside roads. The condors all wear radio tags (a technology first applied in wildlife conservation by Iain Douglas-Hamilton, incidentally), so when the zoo finds they are congregating by a turnout, volunteers head to the spot and pick up any microtrash they find. There’s also been a substantial education component, seeking to convince area residents to, among other things, clean up post-plinking. When FWS and Los Angeles Zoo staff rappelled with a TSA-issue metal detector into the canyon where #717 now lives, they found the baby had consumed microtrash. The little guy was kidnapped and helicoptered to Los Angeles Zoo, where veterinary surgeons removed the trash and stitched up the baby; officials from FWS returned it to its nest. The parents probably never noticed it was gone, but zoo volunteers continued to train a telescope on the bird postop to look for signs of infection.

“This discovery and action has been critical to the recovery program’s success,” said Santa Barbara Zoo conservation research coordinator Ria Boner. Before, just 6 percent of wild-hatched birds were living long enough to leave the nest; now it’s 62 percent. “And you can directly trace that to these interventions,” Boner said.

When they were first released, the birds were eating mostly food provided to them as part of the recovery program; scientists weren’t sure they’d seek carrion on instinct. Now they’re foraging on their own; some condors in Arizona never go to the provisioning areas at all (program officials can tell by the radio-collar data). “We’re starting to have new pairs breeding that didn’t grow up in the trash era, and one of them did not bring trash to the nest,” Sandhaus said.

Yes, getting zoos to do field conservation is a big ask. Yes, it’s hard, and it doesn’t always succeed right away. But it’s totally doable, even by the smallest zoos.

Santa Barbara Zoo is working in its own backyard, which is a way, said several wildlife biologists I spoke to, small zoos like it can make a significant contribution to wildlife.

Edward Louis of Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo is one wildlife biologist showing how bigger zoos, with more resources, can help in some of the world’s most threatened areas. Although he’s director of genetic research for a zoo in Nebraska, he spends 8­­–11 months a year in Madagascar. His programs study biodiversity and biogeography in unique and biologically diverse habitats threatened via multiple vectors, including population growth, political instability, and logging. The Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership is an NGO created out of Louis’ work, and it’s now a permanent, community-based organization working at four sites on the island to protect habitat by involving resident humans—who find themselves benefiting from the protection of what they had been destroying.

“All four sites had hunting going on,” said Louis when I reached him at his lab in Omaha. “We worked with another NGO to create a coloring and activity book about umbrella species in [the local language] and distribute copies to five areas with critically endangered lemurs.” It was just a spiral notebook and a pack of crayons, but it got local kids to convince their parents to stop hunting. “Now there’s pretty much no hunting at any of the sites.”

Connecting habitat fragmented by logging, agriculture, and urbanization so that secretive lemurs can thrive is another challenge. The rainforest has been a resource for locals going back centuries; that only became a problem when people started living longer on average, placing more pressure on the resource, and multinational corporations swooped in to harvest timber for sale overseas.

Louis’ program has planted 40,000 trees to connect fragments of habitat for the black and white ruffed lemur, a critically endangered species that eats almost nothing but fruit and disperses seeds through its scat. The notion that these animals should therefore be protected as a means of preserving and growing the forest “was an easy message to sell to local people,” Louis said. One population of the species has risen from 30 to 100 since 2009 as a result of his and his colleagues’ efforts, with another 20 surviving to their second year in 2012, Louis reported hopefully. (The organization has also been responsible for the naming of an astonishing 21 new lemur species.)

His zoo-supported NGO further works with government to establish land rights: Together they approach local farmers and offer them title to the land, which many subsistence farmers across sub-Saharan Africa and other underdeveloped areas of the globe don’t have, sometimes resulting in quasi-legal “land grabs” by multinationals and corrupt or unscrupulous government officials. The farmers must agree in return to plant trees on half their land as permanent forest, plant 35 percent of the acreage for harvestable timber, and plant 15 percent for commercial crops and fruit trees. Other locals are paid to plant trees with vouchers they can trade in for low-polluting, high-efficiency stoves, which obviate their need to cut down the forest while promoting health and wealth. Madagascar Biodiversity Partnership is also installing photovoltaic arrays at schools to power fans it’s buying for them. Help people want to help habitat is the idea; the group’s motto is “It’s all connected.”

Louis is among those field conservationists who think zoos should be doing more. This needn’t involve forming partnerships with local governments in faraway, unstable countries, and it doesn’t require the decades-long process of reintroducing species on the verge of extinction into the wild. Zoos already have expertise field biologists can use.

Zoos “ought to have to spend 10 percent of their budget on in situ conservation,” said Edward Louis, director of genetic research at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums' member organizations collectively contribute 89 cents per visitor. Parking at SeaWorld costs $16.

Colleen Begg of the Niassa Lion Project in Mozambique gushed to me about the help she gets from the Houston Zoo. The national park where she works has villages within its borders that predate the park’s formation, and convincing residents to care about lions is a significant challenge. Her partners from Houston “know how to engage people,” she said. “Their enviro education, signage—they’ve been critical at educating our community” about the potential benefits of living amid biodiversity. “And this can spread to other zoos. There’s no reason a zoo can't find a field conservationist it can support.”

Zoos “ought to have to spend 10 percent of their total budget on in situ conservation to get accredited,” Louis said. AZA’s Boyle and the AZA communications official I corresponded with kept telling me that member organizations collectively contribute $160 million annually to field conservation. I thought that sounded like a big number, but then I remembered another big number they’d given me: 180 million visitors a year. So $160 million breaks down to 89 cents per visitor. Parking at SeaWorld—parking—costs $16.

Then I headed over to the Wildlife Conservation Society website and downloaded its annual report. In the last fiscal year $86 million went to global conservation programs. That means more than half the money AZA members spend on conservation comes from one organization.

“My focus is to maintain habitat for these animals; I don’t want to have to bring them into captivity,” said Louis. “The northern sportive lemur, there were only 19 left. Now we have 48, but we lost some forest over the summer. In 10 years everything is gonna be gone, including the species, unless we do something locally.”

When my older daughter was a little past her first birthday, my wife and I realized she hadn’t been to the zoo yet. Just before Ericka’s pregnancy we spent two weeks observing wildlife in Botswana, where I’d spent some time after college doing conservation work. After walking beside wild elephants and watching a leopard eat its prey, we weren’t eager to view animals in captivity. But we figured that was our issue; a kid ought to go to the zoo.

At the giraffe exhibit, a baby giraffe nuzzled its mother along the neck; Vivian, held by her own mother, mimicked the gesture. When we turned a corner and the elephant exhibit came into view, Vivian’s jaw dropped. She’d seen pictures of elephants and owned a plastic elephant toy, but I realized only at that moment that she’d had no idea the animals were that size. One showered itself with its trunk, and Vivian, who knew a little sign language, started to make the sign for water. She was so transfixed she couldn’t complete the motion. “Wa…,” she said. She was dumbfounded.

Do zoos matter? Should they even exist? Some would like to see the practice of exhibiting animals for our amusement banned, and Costa Rica is planning to do just that.

Iain Douglas-Hamilton believes zoos still have a purpose, and given his CV, it’s hard to argue with him: His use of radio tracking is now routine for field conservationists (while he’s continued to innovate). Data he collected in the 1980s, along with his subsequent political efforts, make him the single person most responsible for the worldwide ban on ivory trading. At 72, he's still working on multiple fronts to help end the current crisis.

“I’m very well aware of the downside of maintaining elephants in captivity,” he told me. “An elephant with a small range lives in an area of 100 square kilometers, and a zoo at best can have just a few acres. But many people can’t afford to come on safari. I don’t think some people appreciate the importance of the effect zoos can have in the lives of normal people to bring them to love animals. Zoos can be a conduit for sharing the sense of wonder and understanding of animals that I have.”

Two days before this article published, I received a letter at my home from Los Angeles Zoo, of which I am a member. “Your gift will change the future for elephants,” promised the envelope. The appeal within told the story of Mshale, an African elephant who had been attacked by poachers four times (and about whom I’d commissioned an article last month). It went on to tell about 96 Elephant s.org , a new WCS and AZA program focusing on the demand side of the slaughter.

Then it asked me to “make a donation by June 30th to support Los Angeles Zoo…where we will continue our work…nurturing [the elephants in the $42 million exhibit], as well as supporting initiatives in Asia to mitigate human/elephant conflicts….”

It didn’t ask for a donation to the Elephant Crisis Fund, Douglas-Hamilton’s new effort, which spends 100 percent of its funds combatting poaching, trafficking, and demand; it didn’t even ask for a donation to 96Elephants.org. It was leveraging the crisis wild African elephants now face to raise money for the maintenance of captive Asian elphants. “Support the Los Angeles Zoo,” and trust that we are helping wild elephants, it was essentially saying.

Time will tell whether efforts like L.A. Zoo’s, whatever they may be, will be enough. But time is something African elephants don’t have much of. The success or failure of such efforts, and whether or not more zoos will get more involved, may determine whether zoos themselves become museums of natural history.","[{'DATE', 'A few years ago'},

YouTube user Wowforreal posted a video showing the 'alien' figure

Image was originally captured by either the Apollo 15 or 17 missions



Figure can been seen on Google Moon at 27°34’26.35″N 19°36’4.75″W



Nasa claims it was either 'dust, an eyelash [or] scratch on the negative'



Seeing familiar things in random objects is a known as Pareidolia



Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there



An eerie video claiming to show an 'alien' figure walking on the moon went viral earlier this week.



Theories ranged from shadows cast by a nearby boulder to an ancient alien statue placed on the lunar surface.

Now Nasa has announced the figure is simply 'dust, an eyelash [or] scratch on the negative' of the film that took the image.

What is this mystery figure on the moon? The image was spotted on the Google Moon site by web user Jasenko. Nasa announced the shape is simply 'dust, an eyelash [or] scratch on the negative' of the film that took the image

WHAT IS PAREIDOLIA?

Seeing familiar things in random objects is nothing new.

The phenomenon is called Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in random, unconnected data. Human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd, work out how fast a car is travelling, and see patterns. Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there.

The video, showing the images, was posted by YouTube user Wowforreel and it has already been viewed more than two million times in less than a month.

Noah Petro, a deputy project scientist for the Lunar Renaissance Orbiter (LROC) mission that is currently orbiting the moon, told Pix11 that the image was taken by either the Apollo 15 or 17 manned missions to the moon in 1971 and 1972 respectively.

He points out that a current LROC doesn't show any lunar feature that could cause that pattern on the ground.



'My best guess, is that something (dust, an eyelash, scratch on the negative) was on the film,' Dr Petro told Pix11.



'Remember, this was in the pre-digital days when all sorts of nasty things could happen to film.'



The popularity of the video can be explained by a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia, which is the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random stimulus.

This isn’t the first time that Wowforreel has spotted strange objects after ploughing through Google’s moon series.

In January, the user highlighted controversial images which showed what some people believed could be a secret alien base or spaceship on the moon.

The triangular anomaly, spotted on Google's map of the moon, had rows of seven light-like dots along its edge.

THE GOOGLE MOON VIEWER

Google Moon works in a similar way to Google Earth. It was launched in 2009 on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing.

The landing site of each of the Apollo missions is shown on the satellite image, providing more information on each mission as the user zooms in. The first version of Google Moon only included low-resolution satellite imagery of the entire moon, and when zoomed in too close, a Swiss cheese pattern would appear.



'To date, no other feature has ever been discovered which matches this shape on the moon, or any other planet observed by satellite or exploratory rover.

'The anomaly is so huge, it's possible it is some sort of moon base used as a facility for storing and launching alien UFO spacecraft.'

The same YouTube user also claims to have found a similar mystery structure on Earth, nestled under the ice in Antarctica.

'It is also a triangular shape, measuring 125 by 90mtres.



'It is unique in the area,' he said.



Tricks of light in space photography have led to a number of excited reports about alien life in our solar system.



In November, paranormal researchers found what they believed to be evidence of a fossilised iguana on the surface of Mars.



The mysterious object was spotted by UFO Sightings Daily who uncovered the photograph in Nasa’s archives.

Earlier this week a 'human face' was pointed out by the German Aerospace Centre's youth portal, DLR_next, on the Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko

‘This is not the first animal found on Mars, actually there have been about 10-15 to date,’ Mr Warring told news site agoracosmopolitan.com.

More recently, a 'human face' was pointed out by The German Aerospace Centre's youth portal, DLR_next, on the Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

Seeing familiar objects in random objects is nothing new. The phenomenon is called Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus.

It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in random, unconnected data.

Human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd, work out how fast a car is travelling, and see patterns.

Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there.

WHAT IS PAREIDOLIA?

Seeing familiar things in random objects is nothing new.

The phenomenon is called Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in random, unconnected data. Human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd, work out how fast a car is travelling, and see patterns. Scientists claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there.

The video, showing the images, was posted by YouTube user Wowforreel and it has already been viewed more than two million times in less than a month.

Noah Petro, a deputy project scientist for the Lunar Renaissance Orbiter (LROC) mission that is currently orbiting the moon, told Pix11 that the image was taken by either the Apollo 15 or 17 manned missions to the moon in 1971 and 1972 respectively.

He points out that a current LROC doesn't show any lunar feature that could cause that pattern on the ground.



'My best guess, is that something (dust, an eyelash, scratch on the negative) was on the film,' Dr Petro told Pix11.



'Remember, this was in the pre-digital days when all sorts of nasty things could happen to film.'



The popularity of the video can be explained by a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia, which is the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random stimulus.

0,"Indonesian island lost nearly one million hectares of forest over 12 years

For 10 million years the Indonesian island of Sulawesi has been disconnected from other landforms, almost inviting evolution to color outside the lines. Despite a growing population and limited space — more than 17 million people reside on the island as of 2010 — Sulawesi has managed to provide a safe haven to hundreds of unique species as they evolved over millennia.

But that haven may soon be lost to uncontrolled extraction of forest products from Sulawesi’s many pristine ecosystems. According to data from Global Forest Watch, Sulawesi lost more than 950,000 hectares of forest between 2001 and 2013, representing about 5 percent of its area — which may spell danger, particularly for species endemic to the island that exist nowhere else in the world.



More than 550 species of butterflies have been catalogued on Sulawesi, of which more than 300 are endemic. Photo by Rhett A. Butler.

Sulawesi’s 17.4 million hectares comprise 14 different kinds of ecosystems including mangroves, rainforests, lowland forests, caves, montane forests, marine parks. There are even expanses of hot sand near volcanoes that are used for nesting sites by the Maleo (Macrocephalon maleo) – a bird species that exists solely on Sulawesi and which is listed by the IUCN as Endangered due in part to habitat loss.

Currently, Indonesia harbors more threatened species than any other nation in the world. Over 60 percent of mammals and more than one-third of Sulawesi’s birds are endemic. But Indonesia’s other world record only adds to those woes. Its rate of deforestation is the highest in the world, even outdoing Brazil.

Satellite data from Global Forest Watch shows that logging, mining, oil palm plantations and conversion of land for agriculture are driving deforestation in Sulawesi. Over 80 percent of the island’s forests are degraded to some extent, particularly in the lowland areas and in its mangrove areas. Experts say less than 5 percent of Sulawesi’s mangroves and lowland forests remain undisturbed, while 99 percent of its wetlands are either damaged or destroyed.

Much of Sulawesi’s forest loss is due to logging and plantation development. Click to enlarge.





With an upcoming election and a possible change in government, it remains to be seen whether Indonesia will uphold its current moratorium on deforestation aimed at curbing emissions. This is especially of concern now as Indonesia recently announced its plans to continue using “degraded” forests for industrial purposes like oil palm plantations.

Because most of Sulawesi’s pristine lowland forests had been lost nearly two decades ago, its rate of deforestation doesn’t seem too high compared to the rest of Indonesia. In reality however, should the present rate of forest loss continue, it would be nothing short of catastrophic for the island’s remaining wildlife.

In June 2014, a team of scientists discovered a new carnivorous water rat which is literally one of a kind because it represents an entirely new genus. Dr. Kevin Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals at Museum Victoria, was on the team that made this new discovery.

“My first trip to Sulawesi in 2010, we headed to a site on the southeast peninsula where, in 2007, my herpetology colleague had observed healthy lowland forest, home to the Sulawesi Dwarf Hornbill,” Rowe told mongabay.com.

“When we arrived just three years later, the forest was gone. All that was left was a river of silt draining into the coastal mangroves and a small city of tin roofs not yet rusted. The wildlife was gone and what livelihood was left for the local people could only be imagined. My colleague who had witnessed the healthy forest, wept.”





A critically endangered crested black macaque (Macaca nigra) took a photo of itself using equipment owned and set up by David Slater.

Lowland rainforests, Rowe says, are the worst hit by deforestation.

Data mapped by Global Forest Watch shows rampant logging even in protected areas, potentially signaling illegal clearing of the few remaining stretches of intact forests.

Critical strongholds of wildlife like the Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park in northern Sulawesi and the Lore Lindu National Park in central Sulawesi are being threatened by logging, illegal mining for gold and nickel, and development of oil palm plantations on the periphery.

Deforestation has undoubtedly affected the already limited habitat of some of Sulawesi’s iconic endemic mammals like the Babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa) or pig-deer, the endangered lowland Anoa (Bubalus depressicornis), the spectral tarsier (Tarsius tarsier) and the critically endangered crested black macaque (Macaca nigra), a species recently in the news for clicking some stunning “selfies” that are now at the center of a copyright argument.

The future of Sulawesi’s endemic birds is also uncertain. Loss of forests is disturbing the knobbed hornbill (Rhyticeros cassidix), the critically endangered Siau scops owl (Otus manadensis siaoensis) and the endangered Maleo (Macrocephalon maleo).

There are many other species that may be affected by deforestation, but the true extent of its impact is shrouded by lack of research.

“On Sulawesi we may not know what it means for wildlife, in part, because our knowledge of the diversity, distribution, and abundance of wildlife on Sulawesi is so limited,” Rowe said.

But while some of the world’s rarest species are struggling to survive, new species like the carnivorous water rat are still being discovered. Although this is a good sign, it is a race against time.

“Our understanding of the species diversity, even in mammals, is woefully underestimated for Sulawesi,” Rowe said. “Many species are known from a single specimen or a single locality, and therefore, we cannot effectively assess geographic distributions, population size and threats.”

“Many species remain to be discovered and described. We need to improve our understanding of biodiversity so that resource extraction – an essential part of the livelihood of the Sulawesi people – can occur more judiciously with recognition of where the most critical habitat remains,” he said.

“The greatest threat,” Rowe said, “is that we continue to extract; essentially blind to the impacts on Sulawesi’s remarkable and unique wildlife.”

However, not all human communities on Sulawesi are wantonly clearing the island’s forests.

“For generations, the Mamasan people have restricted clearing (land) for plantations and rice fields to areas below 1500 meters,” Rowe said. In particular, preservation of forests on the high plateau of Mount Gandangdewata by the Mamasans has been the most important local conservation initiative Rowe has witnessed, as they are some of the most intact forests on Sulawesi where two new genera were discovered.

These forests currently have no government protection, and Rowe recommends that any efforts to protect them formally should involve and recognize the Mamasan people for their deep knowledge of and cultural connection to them.

“They are the ideal caretakers for this land that they have nurtured and valued for generations.”

Rowe also points to evidence demonstrating the importance of reserves, especially those that include local people in forest protection.

“The National Parks of Sulawesi contain some of the most pristine forest and greatest diversity,” he said. “We should not undervalue their protective role.”

0,"By By Megan Hamilton Sep 6, 2014 in Science Vienna - If someone calls you a bird-brain, you may wish to consider that a compliment. Many birds, especially parrots, are very intelligent. One cockatoo in particular — the Goffin's cockatoo — has shown scientists that it can use tools to obtain food. Scientists from Oxford University, the University of Vienna, and the Max Planck Institute at Seewiesen made this discovery and it's thought to be the first controlled experimental evidence for the social transmission of tool use in any bird species, A couple of years ago, the researchers observed Figaro, a Goffin's cockatoo who'd been raised in captivity, as he was playing with a small stone in his aviary. What they found was that little Figaro snipped long splinters from the beams in his aviary then used them as a rake to haul in items that were outside the bars of his cage. Sometimes he also used twigs that he cut from branches in order to secure his prize, The researchers who filmed him say they don't know how he learned this. What it does show, they say is how much we really don't understand regarding the evolution of innovative behavior and intelligence. ""During our daily observation protocols, Figaro was playing with a small stone,"" said Dr. Alice Auersperg of the University of Vienna, the study's leader. ""At some point he inserted the pebble through the cage mesh, and it fell just outside his reach. After some unsuccessful attempts to reach it with his claw, he fetched a small stick and started fishing for his toy."" Auersperg and her team decided to investigate a bit further, so they substituted the small stone with a nut and started to film. To their surprise, Figaro didn't go searching for a twig, but instead started biting a good-sized splinter out of the aviary beam, she said. ""He cut it when it was just the appropriate size and shape to serve as a raking tool to obtain the nut,"" she reported. ""It was already a surprise to see him use a tool, but we certainly did not expect him to make one by himself,"" Auersperg noted. ""From that time on, Figaro was successful on obtaining the nut every single time we placed it there, nearly each time making new tools."" Clever little Figaro even used an alternative solution in one case — breaking a side arm off a branch, then modifying the leftover piece to the proper size for raking, she said. ""Figaro shows us that, even when they are not habitual tool-users, members of a species that are curious, good problem-solvers, and large-brained, can sculpt tools out of a shapeless source material to fulfill a novel need,"" said professor Alex Kacelnik of Oxford University's Department of Zoology, per the University of Oxford. ""Even though Figaro is still alone in the species and among parrots in showing this capacity, his feat demonstrates that tool craftsmanship can emerge from intelligence not-specialized for tool use. Importantly, after making and using his first tool, Figaro seemed to know exactly what to do, and showed no hesitation in later trials,"" he added. Recently, the researchers made another surprising discovery. They decided to see if other Goffin's cockatoos could learn these skills by watching Figaro. In the experiments, one group of cockatoos watched Figaro at work with a ready-made tool, while another group watched what researchers called 'ghost demonstrations’ — either seeing the tools move the nuts by themselves under the control of magnets hidden under a table, or seeing the nuts move towards Figaro without his using tools, then using magnets to move the food again. At the next step, the birds were all placed in front of an identical problem, according to Figaro's audience three males — and three females — watched the full demonstration and interacted much more with tools and other components of the problem than those who watched the ghost demos, the article noted. They picked up sticks more often than the control groups who watched the ghost demo videos and were more interested in completing the tasks. Weirdly, all three males in the group acquired proficient tool use, but the females in the same group and the males and females in the ghost demo groups did not, per the article. ""This is the first controlled evidence for the social transmission of an original tool use event in any bird so far,"" said Stefan Weber, a student from the University of Vienna who was involved in data collection, per the article. Cockatoos that were successful didn't just imitate Figaro; their tool-use techniques were innovative and new. Figaro held tools by the tip, inserting them through the cage grid at different heights, raking the nuts towards him while at the same time adjusting the tool's position as the target moved closer. The observers who were successful instead laid the sticks on the ground and propelled the nuts into their reach by flipping them quickly. This technique was more efficient for the test circumstances, which were different from those in which Figaro had made his first discovery. In a sense, the pupils surpassed their teacher's performance, per Oxford University. ""This means that although watching Figaro was necessary for their success they did not imitate his exact motor activities,"" Ausperg said in this article. ""Successful observers seemed to attend to the result of Figaro's interaction with the tool but developed their own strategies for reaching the same result, rather than copying his actions. This is typical of what psychologists would call 'emulation learning.'"" ""The importance of them needing an active live demonstrator is that they seem to be sensitive to 'agency'--the existence of a subject whose goal they share,"" said Kacelnik, who was also interviewed for this article. ""This can act through paying more attention to the task, or some more demanding process such as empathising with the actor, but this is not known yet."" Two of the birds who were successful observers were tested later without any ready-made tools. Materials for making the tools was offered instead. One bird spontaneously started making his own tools out of a wood block, while the other failed at first. He was successful after a single demonstration session watching Figaro carve out tools from a wooden block, according to Oxford University. ""There is a substantial difference between repeating a teacher's behaviour and emulating his or her achievements while creating one's own methods,"" Kacelnik noted. ""The latter implies a creative process stimulated by social interaction, while the former could, at least potentially, rely on simpler imitation. The cockatoos seem to emulate and surpass their teacher, which is what all good professors hope for from their best students."" So it seems that these attractive little 13-inch-long parrots are the soul of ingenuity. While they are bred for captivity in vast numbers, little about them is known in the wild, Goffin's cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana) are found in Indonesia's Tanimbar Islands in the Banda Sea. It's been introduced in the Kai Islands and Singapore. While common in captivity, the Goffin's cockatoo is likely rare in the wild. This map shows a few of the locations where they can be found. Google Banda Sea Maps They can be found in lowland primary and secondary forests and agricultural areas, That Bird reports. As with so many other creatures, Goffin's cockatoo populations are in decline, and it's believed that there are more of these birds in captivity than in the wild, which is truly sad. They are listed by the Perhaps the knowledge scientists are gaining about these marvelous little parrots can be used to help save them. That would be truly wonderful, if so.

To their surprise, Figaro didn't go searching for a twig, but instead started biting a good-sized splinter out of the aviary beam, she said.""He cut it when it was just the appropriate size and shape to serve as a raking tool to obtain the nut,"" she reported.Clever little Figaro even used an alternative solution in one case — breaking a side arm off a branch, then modifying the leftover piece to the proper size for raking, she said.""Figaro shows us that, even when they are not habitual tool-users, members of a species that are curious, good problem-solvers, and large-brained, can sculpt tools out of a shapeless source material to fulfill a novel need,"" said professor Alex Kacelnik of Oxford University's Department of Zoology, per the University of Oxford.""Even though Figaro is still alone in the species and among parrots in showing this capacity, his feat demonstrates that tool craftsmanship can emerge from intelligence not-specialized for tool use. Importantly, after making and using his first tool, Figaro seemed to know exactly what to do, and showed no hesitation in later trials,"" he added.Recently, the researchers made another surprising discovery.They decided to see if other Goffin's cockatoos could learn these skills by watching Figaro.In the experiments, one group of cockatoos watched Figaro at work with a ready-made tool, while another group watched what researchers called 'ghost demonstrations’ — either seeing the tools move the nuts by themselves under the control of magnets hidden under a table, or seeing the nuts move towards Figaro without his using tools, then using magnets to move the food again. At the next step, the birds were all placed in front of an identical problem, according to this article also published by Oxford University. A ready-made tool lay on the ground nearby.Figaro's audience three males — and three females — watched the full demonstration and interacted much more with tools and other components of the problem than those who watched the ghost demos, the article noted. They picked up sticks more often than the control groups who watched the ghost demo videos and were more interested in completing the tasks. Weirdly, all three males in the group acquired proficient tool use, but the females in the same group and the males and females in the ghost demo groups did not, per the article.""This is the first controlled evidence for the social transmission of an original tool use event in any bird so far,"" said Stefan Weber, a student from the University of Vienna who was involved in data collection, per the article.Cockatoos that were successful didn't just imitate Figaro; their tool-use techniques were innovative and new. Figaro held tools by the tip, inserting them through the cage grid at different heights, raking the nuts towards him while at the same time adjusting the tool's position as the target moved closer. The observers who were successful instead laid the sticks on the ground and propelled the nuts into their reach by flipping them quickly. This technique was more efficient for the test circumstances, which were different from those in which Figaro had made his first discovery. In a sense, the pupils surpassed their teacher's performance, per Oxford University.""This means that although watching Figaro was necessary for their success they did not imitate his exact motor activities,"" Ausperg said in this article. ""Successful observers seemed to attend to the result of Figaro's interaction with the tool but developed their own strategies for reaching the same result, rather than copying his actions. This is typical of what psychologists would call 'emulation learning.'""""The importance of them needing an active live demonstrator is that they seem to be sensitive to 'agency'--the existence of a subject whose goal they share,"" said Kacelnik, who was also interviewed for this article. ""This can act through paying more attention to the task, or some more demanding process such as empathising with the actor, but this is not known yet.""Two of the birds who were successful observers were tested later without any ready-made tools. Materials for making the tools was offered instead. One bird spontaneously started making his own tools out of a wood block, while the other failed at first. He was successful after a single demonstration session watching Figaro carve out tools from a wooden block, according to Oxford University.""There is a substantial difference between repeating a teacher's behaviour and emulating his or her achievements while creating one's own methods,"" Kacelnik noted. ""The latter implies a creative process stimulated by social interaction, while the former could, at least potentially, rely on simpler imitation. The cockatoos seem to emulate and surpass their teacher, which is what all good professors hope for from their best students.""So it seems that these attractive little 13-inch-long parrots are the soul of ingenuity. While they are bred for captivity in vast numbers, little about them is known in the wild, That Bird Blog reports.Goffin's cockatoos (Cacatua goffiniana) are found in Indonesia's Tanimbar Islands in the Banda Sea. It's been introduced in the Kai Islands and Singapore.They can be found in lowland primary and secondary forests and agricultural areas, That Bird reports.As with so many other creatures, Goffin's cockatoo populations are in decline, and it's believed that there are more of these birds in captivity than in the wild, which is truly sad. They are listed by the IUCN Red List as Near Threatened. Habitat loss, along with the fact that they may be hunted as a crop pest or for food are creating a serious problem.Perhaps the knowledge scientists are gaining about these marvelous little parrots can be used to help save them. That would be truly wonderful, if so.

0,"Saving one of the world’s most endangered primates means re-thinking conservation

When Noga Shanee and her colleagues first arrived in Northeastern Peru on a research trip to study the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda), she was shocked by what she observed.

“We found a dire situation of almost total abandonment. Deforestation, hunting, and wildlife trafficking went almost undisturbed, local people did not know that there were endangered species in their forest as there were almost no environmental education by NGOs in rural areas and no law enforcement by any environmental authority,” Shanee told mongabay.com in a recent interview.

Driven by the failure of local governments and NGOs to effectively intervene, Shanee started her own NGO with the hope of saving the yellow-tailed woolly monkey from what she predicted would be inevitable extinction.

However, what started as an effort to protect a Critically Endangered species soon became part of a larger effort to change conservation in Peru. Working closely with a marginalized group known as campesinos–an impoverished, migrant population of farmers–Shanee observed that intense, outside pressures placed on this group were directly leading to the illegal land clearing and uncontrolled burning she witnessed firsthand. Such activities served to only further worsen the threat to yellow-tailed woolly monkeys as habitat diminished. The fate of the yellow tailed woolly monkey lay in the hands of these farmers, who had little incentive to protect them.

But in order to keep the yellow-tailed woolly monkey from extinction, the first thing that needed to change was the general attitude towards the people threatening it—the campesinos.

The campesinos had unwittingly developed a terrible reputation throughout Peru, with broad implications for the efficacy of conservation programs. Shanee’s work revealed how conventional conservation initiatives in Peru were failing due in part to prejudices against campesinos.

Attacks on the marginalized group had originated with industry representatives who sought to scapegoat campesinos for local rainforest degradation in order to divert negative attention from their own activities, but quickly spread through media. The government, public, and even conservation groups then echoed these views.

“In order to capture funding, [big conservation groups] need to create a spectacle presenting themselves as conservation heroes fighting against ‘bad’, illicit destroyers… when projects fail because of institutional inefficiencies, campesino nature is often blamed,” explained Shanee. “These ‘experiences’ feed new narratives of campesinos as unreliable, backwards and antagonistic to nature and development.”

She noted that conservation groups must be more flexible, allowing local communities and those that work with them take the lead. They also must change how they view locals.

“If there is one important message that I would like to transmit, it is that for poor, local populations, despite conventional wisdom, conservation is not a ‘dirty word,'” Shanee said. “Rural people in Northeastern Peru find nature and biodiversity conservation attractive for their intrinsic, social, aesthetic, and moral values, as well as a measure to ensure their own future, in most cases the prospects of economic benefits are perceived as an obviously welcome, but secondary outcome.”

In an October 2014 interview, Noga Shanee discusses the interconnectedness between both wildlife and campesino populations in Northeastern Peru, the challenges facing local conservation in Peru, and how big conservation groups could be far more effective if they gave more local control.

INTERVIEW WITH NOGA SHANEE

Mongabay: How did you become involved with researching conservation issues in Peru?

Noga Shanee: We arrived in Northeastern Peru in 2007 to carry out research about the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax/Lagothrix flavicauda), a Critically Endangered species that, in those days, was barely studied. When we arrived in the area we found a dire situation of almost total abandonment. Deforestation, hunting, and wildlife trafficking went almost undisturbed, local people did not know that there were endangered species in their forest as there were almost no environmental education by NGOs in rural areas and no law enforcement by any environmental authority. After a month in Peru, we decided to go back to Europe, start an NGO, look for funding and come back to Peru to try to save this species from what looked like its inevitable extinction.

During this work I noticed the incredible inefficiencies of conventional conservation initiatives in Peru. Some of the state’s projects are characterized by perfunctory execution such as the cases of ‘paper parks’ and impoverished environmental enforcement agencies. Many NGO conservation initiatives did not have a direct effect on forest and species conservation and some created antagonism and even retaliation by the local population.

Northeastern Peru is in the heart of the Tropical Andes Hotspot, the richest and most biologically diverse Hotspot in the world. The region was referred to by Dr. Myers as the “global biodiversity epicentre.” The yellow-tailed woolly monkey was listed three times by the International Primatological Society amongst the world’s 25 most threatened primate species since the year 2000. Therefore, this species and the area are both considered high conservation priorities but conservation efforts were failing to stop the deteriorating trends.

I decided to research this situation as deeply as possible, since the study of this species and its habitat can illustrate “symbolic” versus “on the ground” power of global priority species and ecosystems.

My PhD thesis, ‘The Dynamics of Threats and Conservation Efforts for the Tropical Andes Hotspot in Amazonas and San Martin, Peru” covers these issues using a Political Ecology framework. It gives many innovative insights into these issues and suggests community conservation as a valid and promising conservation alternative.

THE CAMPESINOS

Mongabay: Who are the campesinos? And how did you first start working with this group?

Noga Shanee: Campesinos are rural, impoverished farmers, who make up the majority of inhabitants in Northeastern Peru. These populations are usually migrant, suffering from poverty, land insecurity, and degrading environmental resources. They are mainly mestizos (of mixed Indian and European ancestry), and therefore don’t have the same connection to the forests as often related to indigenous populations.

We started working with campesinos as they are the main group living within the distribution of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey and are in direct competition for resources and space with this species. Therefore, the fate of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey is largely dependent on these campesinos’ interest and capacity to protect them, by controlling their own resource use and by limiting the pressures of outside factors such as mining and logging operations.

Mongabay: Why do you think the campesinos are often blamed by NGOs for deforestation and land degradation?

Noga Shanee: Campesinos are the direct users of the resources in the area: very often, they are the ones that cut the forest and hunt the monkeys. A superficial look at the situation does not reveal all the complex network of economic, social, and environmental pressures campesinos face, which require them to use agriculture methods that are very destructive to the environment in order to survive.

Extractive industries’ representatives use discourse against campesinos to divert attention from their own environmental problems and justify their social consequences. These discourses are spread through the media and adopted enthusiastically by urban dwellers. The discourses largely focus on presenting campesinos as criminal, uncultured destroyers of the forest.

These discourses are also promoted by governmental and non-governmental conservation agents, which benefit from them in two main ways. First, conservation agencies, especially the big international NGOs rely on huge budgets. A 2010 paper in Antipode suggests that in order to capture funding, they need to create a spectacle presenting themselves as conservation heroes fighting against ‘bad’, illicit destroyers.

Also, the results of my study suggest, when projects fail because of institutional inefficiencies, campesino nature is often blamed. These “experiences” feed new narratives of campesinos as unreliable, backwards and antagonistic to nature and development.

Mongabay: What are some of the biggest economic challenges this group faces, and how does that tie in to conservation issues?

Noga Shanee: Campesinos in Northeastern Peru are generally very poor and many of them live outside the monetary system. However, even inside this population there is a very large gap between the poor and the rich.

Most of the habitants in Northeastern Peru are migrants from the country’s highlands, where the growing occupation of lands by mining concessions, result in growing population densities, land degradation, and an increase in social conflict. This, with governmental encouragement, pushes a constant flow of environmental refugees into yellow-tailed woolly monkey habitat where they invade forested lands, using farming methods unsuitable for the new ecological zone. The state, as part of their Neoliberal ideology, does not intervene in business ventures, allowing exploitative companies and intermediaries to discriminate against small-scale production and by doing so, forces the maximization of production by further unsustainable methods, as well as widening the gaps within rural populations, between the rich who can invest in such methods, and the poor who cannot. The state’s emphasized control of small-scale forest resource use takes away alternative development possibilities.

My research work highlights the close connection between the pressures on wildlife and the pressures on campesino populations in Northeastern Peru: “The increasing effects of climate change and land degradation, both particularly strong in this area, increase the pressures on campesinos which in turn leads to more clearing, uncontrolled burning and illegal resource use, and thus the pressure spirals back on the environment. All of these operate in parallel, obliging further migration into more marginal lands which aggravate all of these problems and intensify the pressures on O. flavicauda habitat.”

Mongabay: What surprised you most about the campesinos attitudes towards conservation? Do you have any favorite quotes from them from your study?

Noga Shanee: Opposite to local and international discourses and to everything we learnt in University, or by reading many peer-reviewed articles about conservation theories and NGOs experiences, we were surprised to find that Campesinos in Northeastern Peru understand the severity of environmental problems and the relevance to their own lives. They are willing to put effort into conserving forests and wildlife because they find it the right, moral thing to do, rather than as a means to get monetary compensation.

I am always very surprised and amazed to see how much effort some individuals put into conservation, and what personal risks they take. They sacrifice time, money, and often risk their social status. Some of them are also under constant threat of physical violence and even murder, but they keep fighting for what they believe in. This kind of dedication and courage is rarely seen in the work of NGOs or state authorities.

I have seen many articles lately about the many local leaders that have been murdered for defending their lands like the four Asháninka leaders that were recently killed in Ucayali, Peru by logging mafias. These leaders asked the government for help and security but were ignored, after their murder the Peruvian government publically announced that it was taking drastic measure to eradicate illegal logging but quietly fired the environmental authorities that were actually planning to start executing these drastic actions.

The “Justification” publication has many of my favorite quotes, including this:

“We have to defend the patria, the forests, the animals, the rivers; everything that we can see is the creation and we have to defend it. Life started in the water, the spirit of god was above the water. If there is no water there is no life. We have to defend it. Life and water … We and our body are part of the environment … When you kill animals you have to know that they are part of the creation; we are not allowed to kill the animals that give us life, as it is not part of the continuation of the liberating work of Christ.”

Mongabay: In your paper, you describe the application process for conservation concessions and private protected areas as “complicated, expensive and time consuming.” What are some of the most salient challenges that local communities face?

Noga Shanee: It is a three to five year process with an endless amount of stages, each one has its own paperwork processes and they all require some kind of monetary investment. The two things I find most frustrating about this process are: that the governmental agencies themselves do no fully understand the process as laws and personnel constantly change, so the applicant never get clear explanations as to what they need to do, how long it will take or how much it will cost. There is a huge amount of time and money wasted on trial and error. The second is that there is almost always a feeling that the government is doing a favor to the local people by allowing them to conserve. Government bureaucrats are often rude and suspicious towards the many less-formally educated, sometimes illiterate people that are willing to conserve their own lands, so on top of the endless, very expensive process, which by itself is derogatory and discriminative towards the poor, there are also personal insults and arrogance.

GLOBAL MEETS LOCAL

Mongabay: How is climate change affecting local communities in Peru?

Noga Shanee: Climate changes are especially drastic in cloud forest areas such as the yellow-tailed woolly monkey habitat and Peru is one of the countries most affected. They reduce agricultural productivity, reduce people’s health, encourage forest fires, etc.

Nevertheless, these growing environmental pressures on the local communities also create positive consequences by opening new conservation opportunities, as the people that depend directly on the environment for their own survival, understand the severity of these changes and the danger they hold for their future.

Mongabay: How do the rural people feel about REDD schemes?

Noga Shanee: REDD schemes are very problematic at the local level. There are many fraudulent activities all over the country using the name REDD that damage indigenous land and human rights. Even without the frauds, I find REDD ideologically very problematic, as it is based on the moral assumption that developed countries can keep doing whatever they want as long as they pay the poor, less developed countries to be “good.”

It is the essence of Neoliberal Conservation theories as I described it in my thesis: “The world is presented as an infinite pie where all can share the profits of sustainably harvested natural resources, therefore everybody, including nature, wins. Problems become opportunities for further profit and economic growth. ”

According to Jim Igoe and Dan Brockington, the Neoliberal ideological discourse offers a spectrum of positive promises including aiding cash poor countries to protect their biodiversity. Also they promise increased participation, inclusion, development, empowerment of rural populations, eradication of poverty, encouraging environmentally friendly industries, and educating people to love and steward nature. All of these would be achieved through reduction of restrictive state controls and increased market incentives and private property.”

The idea of payments for environmental services by REDD schemes seem completely logical and are known and attractive to many institutions and local people, but it is almost impossible for rural populations to participate because of a very complex, expensive process which they can only apply for after they ensure their land rights, as recognized indigenous communities or through conservation schemes such as conservation concessions (which as I said is a long expensive process by itself). This makes them completely dependent on NGOs and other institutions that use this dependency to compel their own agendas and conservation methodologies.

I showed in my articles that, generally, campesinos do not conserve nature to gain monetary benefits and that REDD schemes might even alienate many campesinos groups from conservation. By that I do not suggest that campesinos do not request or do not require help for economic advancement. The economic situation of the majority of the population is grave and rapidly deteriorating.

I believe campesinos merit sincere support both in economic development and in conservation of their environment; however one should not constitute a condition for the other. Moreover, campesinos’ “good” environmental practices cannot be used as a pretext for developed countries to keep being so destructive.

Mongabay: The UN and many international organizations appear to be recognizing recently that local communities are vital for forest conservation. Do you think this message has made its way to Peru’s leaders?

Noga Shanee: The idea that local people are a vital partner in conservation is not new, there are different ideologies to the integration of local communities in conservation. They are usually clamped together but we can generally divide them to “Integrated Conservation and Development Programmes (ICDP)” and Community Based Conservation (CBC) methodologies. Our work is based on the second.

ICDPs assert that efforts for nature conservation should be balanced with those for the development needs of local populations. They became popular during the 1980s and were adopted by many large international conservation NGOs who began promoting people-orientated projects, integrating conservation and development, in alliance with local organizations. Many of the BINGOs (Big NGOs such as Conservation International, WWF, The Nature Conservancy etc.) and REDD projects use these methodologies.

However, ICDP projects were strongly criticized for perceiving local people as a problem that needed addressing rather than real partners in conservation, using Top-Down approaches. Being economically wasteful and therefore unsustainable, dependent on economic incentives, and so undermining social and ethical values of nature and conservation. And actually, they are criticized for failing to implement conservation or development.

Many political ecologist have noticed that the addition of development aspects to conservation projects pumps these projects with a lot of additional funds which is needed for these BINGOs to feed their growing conservation bureaucracies (fancy offices, cars, extremely high salaries for directors etc.). These projects produce their own literature, which avoids the reality of the wide gap between high-level planning and expenditure and law implementation. This is exactly the kind of literature that describes nature on the edge of extinction and, as I explain above, describes local people as illegal and only interested in monetary incentives. So, basically, what they are saying is: “we are failing, give us more money.”

CBC projects are low budget projects that motivate and stimulate local people to assume ownership and responsibility over their natural resources. They usually start on the smallest geographical scale but can drastically expand through, what Horwich and Lyon (2007) describe as the contagion effect, meaning the same kind of initiatives reproduced in neighboring communities, a phenomenon we see daily in Northeastern Peru. CBC’s focus on conservation and connect to communities through social values rather than through economic incentives, thus leading to stewardship for nature. Incentives such as economic alternatives can be integrated into the projects at later stages as additional components. These projects are very common in rural areas and predominantly successful, but big conservation agencies seldom acknowledge or support them because of their small scale and geographic isolation (Horwich and Lyon 2007) and probably, also because these little stories of success disturb the reality BINGOs want to produce, of themselves being heroes fighting bad illegal locals.

Seymour (1994) suggests that success of CBCs depends on the intrinsic capacity and traditions of the specific community to organize their resource use rather than on the external project, and so successful projects are “discovered” rather than designed as such. I completely agree with Seymour on that. Local people had been conserving their forests for thousands of years without the recognition or help from external institutions such as the UN. The main thing the UN could do to help locally-run conservation is to convince NGOs that although ICDPs are much more glamorous and easier for big NGOs to run, the CBCs are much more sincere and they succeed in bringing real change for conservation. Local people don’t need someone to tell them to conserve, they need the governments to stop disturbing them, and the NGOs to stop disregarding their efforts and to be there for them, support and help them to achieve their goals.

Mongabay: Peru recently signed a deal with Norway and Germany to tackle rampant deforestation across the country. How do you think this will impact the campesions?

Noga Shanee: I don’t think it will make any real impact on a local level; there are thousands of huge projects that stream millions and millions of dollars around the world for conservation. Unfortunately, corruption and intentional inefficiency within state and private conservation institutions mean that human and economic resources are dramatically reduced as initiatives get closer to implementation on the ground. In general, more and more money goes towards conservation worldwide and at the same time the environmental situation is only deteriorating. We need to ask ourselves: why?

Normally what happens in Northeastern Peru when a big bunch of government money is dedicated to conservation, governmental agencies start a long process of planning projects. After about a year, they start a process of socializing these projects to local people which means many big, expensive meetings where they talk about huge sums of money that are going to be spent on conservation and on economic improvement in local people’s lives. Then there is a long quiet period and this is where the big money usually seems to disappear in the thin air and a few very small initiatives, such as a few tree nurseries (which very often produce the exotic eucalyptus and pine, rather than native species) appear in a few places, until they are abandoned forever.

These big projects only disappoint campesinos and violate their trust in conservation agencies and projects.

MOVING FORWARD

Mongabay: What are some examples of the most promising conservation schemes you’ve seen emerge from local communal organizations?

Noga Shanee: The main successes are the contingence of conservation initiatives, from just a few projects in Northeastern Peru around the year of 2005, there are now hundreds of local initiatives, some trying to register formal reserves, some are ronda run conservation areas (ARCAs), and some are informal landscape level conservation efforts.

We know that these efforts are working: in 2008 we undertook the first long-term census of the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey population at our main field site in the community of La Esperanza. From this study we were able to calculate the density of the species in the forest (Published in International Journal of Primatology). This June we finished our second census of the species, in order to accurately determine how the population size has changed since we first began conservation efforts in the area. Preliminary results show an increase in average group size and individual densities of around 30 percent since our first study. Most of the increase is in infant and juvenile monkeys, which suggest that the increase is due to natural breeding and lack of hunting rather that in migration of monkeys from other areas. Capuchin monkeys are 50 percent more common than they were in 2008. The complete results will be published soon.

To examine the reasons for these increases we also evaluated deforestation rates at La Esperanza and the surrounding areas over the past 5, 10, and 20 years to see what affect our work has had on the forest as a whole. Results are still not complete but preliminary data suggest a fall in the rate of clearance of new forest. We will eventually be doing this for all areas to evaluate the short and long term effects of conservation actions made by local communities.

Mongabay: What are some of your recommendations for how NGOs and local groups could work together more effectively?

Noga Shanee: NGOs should be much more attentive to local needs. I have heard rural environmental educators and grassroots movements often complain that that they do not get the support needed to transmit conservation agendas or internally controlled resource use. Usually, low cost, elementary requests were raised. These included updated ecological or legal information, simple equipment, printing of posters they designed, etc. Attentive, open door approaches, can allow NGOs to make genuine impact with minimal investment.

Also, NGOs must take a much more active role in fighting corruption and intentional inefficiencies, as well as in law enforcement in the countries they work in. This is not something they are doing much as they are afraid of the consequences, but it is the main thing that they can do to really help local people achieving their conservation goals.

If there is one important message that I would like to transmit, it is that for poor, local populations, despite conventional wisdom, conservation is not a “dirty word.” Rural people in Northeastern Peru find nature and biodiversity conservation attractive for their intrinsic, social, aesthetic, and moral values, as well as a measure to ensure their own future, in most cases the prospects of economic benefits are perceived as an obviously welcome, but secondary outcome.

Mongabay: How best can attitudes about the campesinos be changed?

Noga Shanee: A lot of diffusion of successful, local conservation projects would be very helpful to global conservation and to the campesinos who initiate conservation projects. It is important to show donors that the normal discourse of the big NGOs, painting a picture of a “doom and gloom” reality, is aimed to attract bigger donations to themselves, while small, successful, local projects suffer very low funding and often fail to sustain themselves. More diffusion will bring more funding to these projects and will allow them to achieve more. This is the only way to make conservation more profound, sincere and significant, and to change the global reality of the destruction of nature.

When Noga Shanee and her colleagues first arrived in Northeastern Peru on a research trip to study the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda), she was shocked by what she observed.

“We found a dire situation of almost total abandonment. Deforestation, hunting, and wildlife trafficking went almost undisturbed, local people did not know that there were endangered species in their forest as there were almost no environmental education by NGOs in rural areas and no law enforcement by any environmental authority,” Shanee told mongabay.com in a recent interview.

Driven by the failure of local governments and NGOs to effectively intervene, Shanee started her own NGO with the hope of saving the yellow-tailed woolly monkey from what she predicted would be inevitable extinction.

However, what started as an effort to protect a Critically Endangered species soon became part of a larger effort to change conservation in Peru. Working closely with a marginalized group known as campesinos–an impoverished, migrant population of farmers–Shanee observed that intense, outside pressures placed on this group were directly leading to the illegal land clearing and uncontrolled burning she witnessed firsthand. Such activities served to only further worsen the threat to yellow-tailed woolly monkeys as habitat diminished. The fate of the yellow tailed woolly monkey lay in the hands of these farmers, who had little incentive to protect them.

But in order to keep the yellow-tailed woolly monkey from extinction, the first thing that needed to change was the general attitude towards the people threatening it—the campesinos.

The campesinos had unwittingly developed a terrible reputation throughout Peru, with broad implications for the efficacy of conservation programs. Shanee’s work revealed how conventional conservation initiatives in Peru were failing due in part to prejudices against campesinos.

Attacks on the marginalized group had originated with industry representatives who sought to scapegoat campesinos for local rainforest degradation in order to divert negative attention from their own activities, but quickly spread through media. The government, public, and even conservation groups then echoed these views.

“In order to capture funding, [big conservation groups] need to create a spectacle presenting themselves as conservation heroes fighting against ‘bad’, illicit destroyers… when projects fail because of institutional inefficiencies, campesino nature is often blamed,” explained Shanee. “These ‘experiences’ feed new narratives of campesinos as unreliable, backwards and antagonistic to nature and development.”

She noted that conservation groups must be more flexible, allowing local communities and those that work with them take the lead. They also must change how they view locals.

“If there is one important message that I would like to transmit, it is that for poor, local populations, despite conventional wisdom, conservation is not a ‘dirty word,'” Shanee said. “Rural people in Northeastern Peru find nature and biodiversity conservation attractive for their intrinsic, social, aesthetic, and moral values, as well as a measure to ensure their own future, in most cases the prospects of economic benefits are perceived as an obviously welcome, but secondary outcome.”

In an October 2014 interview, Noga Shanee discusses the interconnectedness between both wildlife and campesino populations in Northeastern Peru, the challenges facing local conservation in Peru, and how big conservation groups could be far more effective if they gave more local control.

INTERVIEW WITH NOGA SHANEE

Mongabay: How did you become involved with researching conservation issues in Peru?

Noga Shanee: We arrived in Northeastern Peru in 2007 to carry out research about the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax/Lagothrix flavicauda), a Critically Endangered species that, in those days, was barely studied. When we arrived in the area we found a dire situation of almost total abandonment. Deforestation, hunting, and wildlife trafficking went almost undisturbed, local people did not know that there were endangered species in their forest as there were almost no environmental education by NGOs in rural areas and no law enforcement by any environmental authority. After a month in Peru, we decided to go back to Europe, start an NGO, look for funding and come back to Peru to try to save this species from what looked like its inevitable extinction.

During this work I noticed the incredible inefficiencies of conventional conservation initiatives in Peru. Some of the state’s projects are characterized by perfunctory execution such as the cases of ‘paper parks’ and impoverished environmental enforcement agencies. Many NGO conservation initiatives did not have a direct effect on forest and species conservation and some created antagonism and even retaliation by the local population.

Northeastern Peru is in the heart of the Tropical Andes Hotspot, the richest and most biologically diverse Hotspot in the world. The region was referred to by Dr. Myers as the “global biodiversity epicentre.” The yellow-tailed woolly monkey was listed three times by the International Primatological Society amongst the world’s 25 most threatened primate species since the year 2000. Therefore, this species and the area are both considered high conservation priorities but conservation efforts were failing to stop the deteriorating trends.

I decided to research this situation as deeply as possible, since the study of this species and its habitat can illustrate “symbolic” versus “on the ground” power of global priority species and ecosystems.

My PhD thesis, ‘The Dynamics of Threats and Conservation Efforts for the Tropical Andes Hotspot in Amazonas and San Martin, Peru” covers these issues using a Political Ecology framework. It gives many innovative insights into these issues and suggests community conservation as a valid and promising conservation alternative.

THE CAMPESINOS

Mongabay: Who are the campesinos? And how did you first start working with this group?

Noga Shanee: Campesinos are rural, impoverished farmers, who make up the majority of inhabitants in Northeastern Peru. These populations are usually migrant, suffering from poverty, land insecurity, and degrading environmental resources. They are mainly mestizos (of mixed Indian and European ancestry), and therefore don’t have the same connection to the forests as often related to indigenous populations.

We started working with campesinos as they are the main group living within the distribution of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey and are in direct competition for resources and space with this species. Therefore, the fate of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey is largely dependent on these campesinos’ interest and capacity to protect them, by controlling their own resource use and by limiting the pressures of outside factors such as mining and logging operations.

Mongabay: Why do you think the campesinos are often blamed by NGOs for deforestation and land degradation?

Noga Shanee: Campesinos are the direct users of the resources in the area: very often, they are the ones that cut the forest and hunt the monkeys. A superficial look at the situation does not reveal all the complex network of economic, social, and environmental pressures campesinos face, which require them to use agriculture methods that are very destructive to the environment in order to survive.

Extractive industries’ representatives use discourse against campesinos to divert attention from their own environmental problems and justify their social consequences. These discourses are spread through the media and adopted enthusiastically by urban dwellers. The discourses largely focus on presenting campesinos as criminal, uncultured destroyers of the forest.

These discourses are also promoted by governmental and non-governmental conservation agents, which benefit from them in two main ways. First, conservation agencies, especially the big international NGOs rely on huge budgets. A 2010 paper in Antipode suggests that in order to capture funding, they need to create a spectacle presenting themselves as conservation heroes fighting against ‘bad’, illicit destroyers.

Also, the results of my study suggest, when projects fail because of institutional inefficiencies, campesino nature is often blamed. These “experiences” feed new narratives of campesinos as unreliable, backwards and antagonistic to nature and development.

Mongabay: What are some of the biggest economic challenges this group faces, and how does that tie in to conservation issues?

Noga Shanee: Campesinos in Northeastern Peru are generally very poor and many of them live outside the monetary system. However, even inside this population there is a very large gap between the poor and the rich.

Most of the habitants in Northeastern Peru are migrants from the country’s highlands, where the growing occupation of lands by mining concessions, result in growing population densities, land degradation, and an increase in social conflict. This, with governmental encouragement, pushes a constant flow of environmental refugees into yellow-tailed woolly monkey habitat where they invade forested lands, using farming methods unsuitable for the new ecological zone. The state, as part of their Neoliberal ideology, does not intervene in business ventures, allowing exploitative companies and intermediaries to discriminate against small-scale production and by doing so, forces the maximization of production by further unsustainable methods, as well as widening the gaps within rural populations, between the rich who can invest in such methods, and the poor who cannot. The state’s emphasized control of small-scale forest resource use takes away alternative development possibilities.

My research work highlights the close connection between the pressures on wildlife and the pressures on campesino populations in Northeastern Peru: “The increasing effects of climate change and land degradation, both particularly strong in this area, increase the pressures on campesinos which in turn leads to more clearing, uncontrolled burning and illegal resource use, and thus the pressure spirals back on the environment. All of these operate in parallel, obliging further migration into more marginal lands which aggravate all of these problems and intensify the pressures on O. flavicauda habitat.”

Then there is a long quiet period and this is where the big money usually seems to disappear in the thin air and a few very small initiatives, such as a few tree nurseries (which very often produce the exotic eucalyptus and pine, rather than native species) appear in a few places, until they are abandoned forever.

These big projects only disappoint campesinos and violate their trust in conservation agencies and projects.

MOVING FORWARD

Mongabay: What are some examples of the most promising conservation schemes you’ve seen emerge from local communal organizations?

Noga Shanee: The main successes are the contingence of conservation initiatives, from just a few projects in Northeastern Peru around the year of 2005, there are now hundreds of local initiatives, some trying to register formal reserves, some are ronda run conservation areas (ARCAs), and some are informal landscape level conservation efforts.

We know that these efforts are working: in 2008 we undertook the first long-term census of the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey population at our main field site in the community of La Esperanza. From this study we were able to calculate the density of the species in the forest (Published in International Journal of Primatology). This June we finished our second census of the species, in order to accurately determine how the population size has changed since we first began conservation efforts in the area. Preliminary results show an increase in average group size and individual densities of around 30 percent since our first study. Most of the increase is in infant and juvenile monkeys, which suggest that the increase is due to natural breeding and lack of hunting rather that in migration of monkeys from other areas. Capuchin monkeys are 50 percent more common than they were in 2008. The complete results will be published soon.

To examine the reasons for these increases we also evaluated deforestation rates at La Esperanza and the surrounding areas over the past 5, 10, and 20 years to see what affect our work has had on the forest as a whole. Results are still not complete but preliminary data suggest a fall in the rate of clearance of new forest. We will eventually be doing this for all areas to evaluate the short and long term effects of conservation actions made by local communities.

Mongabay: What are some of your recommendations for how NGOs and local groups could work together more effectively?

Noga Shanee: NGOs should be much more attentive to local needs. I have heard rural environmental educators and grassroots movements often complain that that they do not get the support needed to transmit conservation agendas or internally controlled resource use. Usually, low cost, elementary requests were raised. These included updated ecological or legal information, simple equipment, printing of posters they designed, etc. Attentive, open door approaches, can allow NGOs to make genuine impact with minimal investment.

Also, NGOs must take a much more active role in fighting corruption and intentional inefficiencies, as well as in law enforcement in the countries they work in. This is not something they are doing much as they are afraid of the consequences, but it is the main thing that they can do to really help local people achieving their conservation goals.

If there is one important message that I would like to transmit, it is that for poor, local populations, despite conventional wisdom, conservation is not a “dirty word.” Rural people in Northeastern Peru find nature and biodiversity conservation attractive for their intrinsic, social, aesthetic, and moral values, as well as a measure to ensure their own future, in most cases the prospects of economic benefits are perceived as an obviously welcome, but secondary outcome.

Mongabay: How best can attitudes about the campesinos be changed?

Noga Shanee: A lot of diffusion of successful, local conservation projects would be very helpful to global conservation and to the campesinos who initiate conservation projects. It is important to show donors that the normal discourse of the big NGOs, painting a picture of a “doom and gloom” reality, is aimed to attract bigger donations to themselves, while small, successful, local projects suffer very low funding and often fail to sustain themselves. More diffusion will bring more funding to these projects and will allow them to achieve more. This is the only way to make conservation more profound, sincere and significant, and to change the global reality of the destruction of nature.

0,"Parrot fever: Hong Kong investigates sporadic case of psittacosis

On October 30, 2014, the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) recorded a sporadic case of psittacosis affecting a 57-year-old man with underlying illness.

He presented with fever, mild cough and myalgia since October 10. He was admitted to a public hospital on October 22 and required intensive care support initially. His chest X-ray showed signs of pneumonia. His tracheal aspirate was later tested positive for Chlamydophila psittaci by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on October 30.

His condition was stable and he was discharged on November 4. He had no recent travel history. He did not keep birds at home and he had no contact history of birds or bird droppings. His home contacts were all asymptomatic. Investigation is on-going.

Most wild and domestic birds can be natural reservoirs of the causative bacteria,Chlamydophila psittaci, however parrots, parakeets, and cockatiels are among the birds most commonly implicated in human infection.

The vast majority of cases of psittacosis are a direct result of human exposure to pet birds, either as owners or pet shop employees. The remainder of human cases is due to occupational exposure; turkey processing workers, vets, and zoo workers to name a few.

In the bird, infection may not become apparent unless resistance is compromised through conditions like crowding, transport, deficiencies in nutrition or other stressors.

The infection in the bird is mostly gastrointestinal and respiratory with the bird showing the following symptoms: diarrhea, nasal discharge, fever and discharge from the eyes.

The organism is shed in the liquid feces or nasal discharge of a sick bird. Even healthy birds can be carriers of psittacosis and may shed the organism intermittently.

Here it can contaminate the environment, the bird’s cage and the feathers. As the feces dries, the bacteria become airborne from the motion of the feathers and this is where humans can get infected.

The aerosolized, airborne particles are very small and do not settle easily and remain suspended in the atmosphere for long periods of time.

The infection in people can range from an inapparent illness to a systemic disease and severe pneumonia with some fatalities reported.

The onset of disease may be fever, headache, body aches, cough and shortness of breath. The illness is usually self-limiting (up to 2 weeks).

More severe disease may show diarrhea, vomiting and enlarged liver and spleen. The organism can affect some organ systems other that the respiratory. Cases of endocarditis, arthritis and hepatitis have been seen.

Psittacosis is treatable with doxycycline. The fatality rate of patients treated with antibiotics is very low, less than 1%.

0,"New report finds that 83 percent of recent murders of environmental activists in Peru linked to police, military, or private security guards

On September 1st, indigenous activist, Edwin Chota, and three other indigenous leaders were gunned down and their bodies thrown into rivers near the border of Peru and Brazil. Chota, an internationally-known leader of the Asháninka in Peru, had warned several times that his life was on the line for his vocal stance against the destruction of his peoples’ forests, yet the Peruvian government did nothing to protect him—or others. Unfortunately, Edwin Chota and his indigenous partners were only the latest in a longline of cold blood killings in the forests of Peru.

“We have faced violence, racism, neglect indifference, all arising from the sense of indigenous as worthless,” wrote the indigenous rights group the Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin (COICA) after the murders came to light. “We are outraged at the ‘colonization’ of the forest, where indigenous peoples are killed with impunity. We are abandoned and stripped of our riches by those in search of rubber yesterday, and today by loggers, miners, oil extractors, and tomorrow anyone who has ‘power.'”

A new report by Global Witness finds that at least 57 environmental and land activists have been murdered in Peru in just 12 years, making the country the fourth most dangerous country on Earth for environmental activists, at least based on current data. The report comes just weeks before Peru hosts the next UN climate meeting in Lima, which is expected to lay the final groundwork for a new agreement in Paris 2015.

“The murders of Edwin Chota and his colleagues are tragic reminders of a paradox at work in the climate negotiations,” said Patrick Alley, co-Founder of Global Witness. “While Peru’s government chairs negotiations on how to solve our climate crisis, it is failing to protect the people on the frontline of environmental protection. Environmental defenders embody the resolve we need to halt global warming. The message is clear, if you want to save the environment, then stop people killing environmental defenders.”

Illegal logging and illegal mining are rife across Peru. In fact, illegal loggers have been charged with the murder of Chota and the three other leaders: Jorge Ríos Pérez, Leoncio Quinticima Melendez, and Francisco Pinedo.

Peru is not alone in losing so many environmental activists. A report earlier this year by Global Witness found that 908 environmental and land activists had been murdered between 2002 and 2013 in 38 countries. However, even this was likely a major underestimation. In many countries where conflict is rife, reliable data is scarce. Global Witness admitted it had to leave out many possible murders due to lack of corroborating information.

“This crisis is poorly understood, and efforts to address it woefully inadequate,” writes Global Witness. “A lack of systematic monitoring means that publicly available information relating to violence against environmental and land defenders is hard to find and even harder to verify.”

But Peru’s rash of murders—which has been increasing in recent years—has yet to push the government to change. In fact, 83 percent of the murders of environmental activists were undertaken by police, the military, or private security agencies.

Nor have the murders pushed Peru recognize the land rights of its indigenous people. According to Global Witness, only 38 percent of Peruvian indigenous groups have legal tenure to their traditional lands. Currently, 20 million hectares of indigenous land waits to be processed by Peruvian authorities.

At the same time, a new law passed and signed by President Ollanta Humala in July seeks to jumpstart investment in mining and fossil fuels by slashing environmental protections. The law reduces environmental fines in many instances, forces environmental impact statements to be completed in just 45 days, and will allow fossil fuel exploitation in any newly established protected area. The law was blasted by over 100 local and international environmental groups.

“Unfortunately, the passing of law 30230 by Peru’s Congress in July 2014 raises serious doubts over the country’s willingness to [grant legal tenure to indigenous people],” reads Global Witness’ report. “The law grants extended land use rights to investors for the expansion of large-scale agriculture, mining, logging and infrastructure projects.”

Still, just a few months after the passage of the controversial law, Peru announced a major agreement with Norway and Germany to make the Amazonian country carbon neutral when it comes to deforestation and agriculture by 2021. Meeting such a goal would require a massive decrease in current deforestation rates. Between 2001 and 2012, Peru lost 1.5 million hectares of forest—an area larger than Connecticut—according to Global Forest Watch. Moreover, deforestation has been on the rise: in 2012 the country lost 246,130 hectares, the largest amount in the dozen years monitored.

As a part of the agreement, which would see Norway pay $300 million for proven results, Peru has pledged to grant five million hectares of land title to indigenous groups and incorporate two million hectares of indigenous land into conservation payment programs.

Yet this agreement appears to fly in the face of notorious law 30230, which begs the question: is Peru trying to have its cake and eat it too? Is the agreement with Norway and Germany merely a way to deflect criticism ahead of hosting the UN Climate Summit? Or is Peru truly serious about forest protection?

If Peru is in earnest, then Global Witness says the best way to protect forests is to end the ambiguity around land ownership.

“The realization of indigenous land rights has proven to be one of the most effective ways to curb deforestation, but communities are not receiving the support and protections they need,” reads the report.

The organization recommends that Peru process indigenous claims for the full 20 million hectares (and not just the five listed in the Germany-Norway agreement), investigate possible links between illegal loggers and miners and public officials, provide more resources to agencies tackling illegal logging and mining, and revoke law 30230 as well as another law that allows security forces to use force against peaceful protestors.

“Peru’s credibility as a forest protector hinges upon providing land and resource rights to the country’s indigenous and rural populations,” said David Salisbury, a geography and environment professor at the University of Richmond professor who has spent time in Chota’s community. “If you want to keep forests standing, you have to invest in people who live in them, as they have the most at stake in the sustainable development of those areas…The government should recognize there are people in the forests, and give them rights to them.”

Compared to many countries, Peru still has impressive forest cover: more than 77 million hectares, covering around 60 percent of the country, according to Global Forest Watch. The country also has a wealth of cultural and indigenous diversity—including some 300,000 indigenous people. Many of these tribes have spent decades, even centuries, fighting for their forests.

A wealth of scientific research has found that among the best ways to keep forests standing is to grant legal title to the indigenous people who live in them and allow local management.

Salisbury put it this way: “How can you maintain standing forest, and mitigate climate change, if the defenders of the forest are being assassinated?”

Still, just a few months after the passage of the controversial law, Peru announced a major agreement with Norway and Germany to make the Amazonian country carbon neutral when it comes to deforestation and agriculture by 2021. Meeting such a goal would require a massive decrease in current deforestation rates. Between 2001 and 2012, Peru lost 1.5 million hectares of forest—an area larger than Connecticut—according to Global Forest Watch. Moreover, deforestation has been on the rise: in 2012 the country lost 246,130 hectares, the largest amount in the dozen years monitored.

As a part of the agreement, which would see Norway pay $300 million for proven results, Peru has pledged to grant five million hectares of land title to indigenous groups and incorporate two million hectares of indigenous land into conservation payment programs.

Yet this agreement appears to fly in the face of notorious law 30230, which begs the question: is Peru trying to have its cake and eat it too? Is the agreement with Norway and Germany merely a way to deflect criticism ahead of hosting the UN Climate Summit? Or is Peru truly serious about forest protection?

If Peru is in earnest, then Global Witness says the best way to protect forests is to end the ambiguity around land ownership.

“The realization of indigenous land rights has proven to be one of the most effective ways to curb deforestation, but communities are not receiving the support and protections they need,” reads the report.

The organization recommends that Peru process indigenous claims for the full 20 million hectares (and not just the five listed in the Germany-Norway agreement), investigate possible links between illegal loggers and miners and public officials, provide more resources to agencies tackling illegal logging and mining, and revoke law 30230 as well as another law that allows security forces to use force against peaceful protestors.

“Peru’s credibility as a forest protector hinges upon providing land and resource rights to the country’s indigenous and rural populations,” said David Salisbury, a geography and environment professor at the University of Richmond professor who has spent time in Chota’s community. “If you want to keep forests standing, you have to invest in people who live in them, as they have the most at stake in the sustainable development of those areas…The government should recognize there are people in the forests, and give them rights to them.”

Compared to many countries, Peru still has impressive forest cover: more than 77 million hectares, covering around 60 percent of the country, according to Global Forest Watch. The country also has a wealth of cultural and indigenous diversity—including some 300,000 indigenous people. Many of these tribes have spent decades, even centuries, fighting for their forests.

A wealth of scientific research has found that among the best ways to keep forests standing is to grant legal title to the indigenous people who live in them and allow local management.

Salisbury put it this way: “How can you maintain standing forest, and mitigate climate change, if the defenders of the forest are being assassinated?”

0,"Angola’s tourist plans, which focus on attracting wealthy visitors, risk sidelining local people’s needs and could threaten their livelihoods on the Kwanza river

Fishermen lay nets in the Kwanza river at dusk. The tide is low and the silence is a far cry from Angola’s busy capital Luanda, an hour’s drive away. The river was an important gateway into Angola for slave traders during the colonial era. Now, the government has started to search for oil along the riverbanks, while Kissama national park is adjusting to life after civil war.



The park reopened in 2002 with species including elephants and the endangered giant sable antelope, imported from Botswana and South Africa, which had been wiped out by hunger and poaching.

The Kwanza river is important to thousands of Angolans. There is now competition over catches between locals and established fishing lodges with modern equipment and speedboats.

Kwanza Lodge is a popular weekend fishing resort, owned by a relative of Angola’s President, José Eduardo dos Santos. The manager is a South African called Manny Milner. Angola is developing as a result of the influx of expats and oil revenues in one of the world’s fastest growing economies. But the new Angola isn’t accessible to everybody. Nine out of 10 visitors this weekend are expats: Portuguese soap opera actors, Chinese engineers and Brazilian construction workers.

Milner believes that eco-tourism is the future for Angola. “It’s a way to protect the rural community from a large-scale tourist industry,” she says. In 2016, Luanda will host a large professional golf tournament where enthusiasts of the sport will be encouraged to visit Kissama national park.



Angola’s official tourist plans focus on wealthy visitors who will sample luxury and stability experienced by only a minority of the Angolan people.



According to Paul Wesson, a South African who runs Eco-Tur, Angola’s 12 years of stability have finally opened up the country to the outside world. “There’s always been interest,” he says. “Angola is the only country in southern Africa left for well-travelled people to explore, who’ve already seen the Serengeti and Kalahari. This is the final frontier of wildlife tourism in southern Africa.”

One of the attractions of tourism in Angola is fishing, an industry threatened by demand from locals for food and tourists for sport. But, according to Roland Goetz, director of Kissama national park, fishing in the Kwanza river is unregulated, which could disturb both the river and the park’s ecosystems.

In 2007, the regional thinktank Institute for Security Studies warned of the permanent degradation of the marine environment in southern Africa as a result of overfishing. Its report, The crisis of marine plunder in Africa, concluded: “This in turn will continue to adversely impact on food security and economic development, with coastal communities dependent on fishing being the hardest hit.”

This is already the case in Namibe province, where fishermen risk their lives in small rowing boats on rough seas, lacking equipment and earning next to nothing. Not far away, modern fishing equipment and robust boats rest in the sand at tourist lodges.



Namibe province accounts for 65% of Angola’s fish production and has in recent years gained the interest of the global fishing industry. Before the second world war, when Angola was a Portuguese colony, only Lisbon’s freighters were allowed in these waters. Now, with the market open to foreign investors, even Angola’s waters have become pieces of a geopolitical jigsaw puzzle. There is no way for Namibe’s fishermen to compete with the larger boats: while the former do small-scale fishing, vessels from South Africa, the EU, Russia and China operate in eco-certified areas.

Pedro Soares is a former fisherman who now works as a chef at a fishing resort. He’s worried about the Angolan people’s place in society. He wants the tourist industry to blossom and provide jobs, but not if it means catering only for foreigners. “That’s the case with the oil,” he says. “We need to break through as a people and claim jobs outside the service sector. As now, the region’s best fish goes to Luanda while we’re left with the scraps.”

Soares believes that Angola’s young people can change this. “We must mature, educate ourselves and make wise decision[s], which I’m sure we’ll do. We want more out of life than just providing the rest of the world with oil and fish.”

0,"Since 2007, Peruvian-based conservation organization, Neotropical Primate Conservation (NPC), has been working closely with local communities in the Amazon to protect one of the world’s most endangered primates; the yellow-tailed woolly monkey. In recent weeks, NPC has confirmed that populations of the primate are on the increase and that deforestation levels in the local area are now lower than both regional and national average rates. Progress, say Doctors Sam and Noga Shanee from NPC, is largely down to the commitment and hard work of the local people in the area. The organization is encouraging other international NGOs to work more closely with local communities in their efforts to preserve species and habitats.

The yellow-tailed woolly monkeys are beautiful primates, who are notable for the distinctive golden fur on the underside of their tails. They were thought to be extinct as recently as 1975 until a small population was discovered in Pedro Ruiz in the Amazonas region of the Peruvian Andes. Doctors Sam and Noga Shanee established NPC in the local area in 2007 with the specific goal of trying to help the monkeys in their fight for survival.

Restoring a Devastated Forest

The Amazonas region is a biodiversity hotspot but, when NPC began its work in 2007, it was also highly populated with worrying rates of deforestation. NPC quickly began working with local communities to facilitate projects, including the development of community-run forest reserves and within eight years have established 11 reserves which effectively protect 80,000 hectares of precious cloud forest.

The most recent population census carried out by NPC has confirmed what the organization had hoped: the yellow-tails are thriving. Not only has the population grown in the protected areas, but a significant increase in infants was also recorded. Of course, the advantage of the reserves is that it is not just the monkeys that benefit but all species of animal, bird and plant in the area.

Dr. Sam Shanee said that he hoped these new results would encourage other NGOs and governmental organizations to reach out to local communities in their conservation efforts. Dr. Shanee tells One Green Planet:

“The idea of our work, and community conservation as a whole, is that protecting the environment isn’t something that only governments and big NGO’s can do, it is something that benefits all people and is within reach of all people.”

Working With Locals to Save Wildlife

Dr. Shanee said the cause of deforestation and biodiversity loss was often blamed on local people who were portrayed as the “bad guys.”

He said: “What we continue to find is that with effective discussion of the importance of forests and wildlife many local people not only understand the need for conservation but also become great conservationists leading their communities and, as seen in this study, succeeding in protecting some of the most threatened species and habitats through simple cost-effective solutions where many larger projects/institutions have failed.”

As it appears from this study, protecting an ecosystem means protecting all of the individual parts. If we hope to save any individual species of animal, like the yellow-tail, it requires a complex understanding of the threats to the animals and the intimate ties that the species has to its habitat and the humans who share it. Working to heal the different facets of the issue is the only way to truly achieve a whole success.

Of course, the advantage of the reserves is that it is not just the monkeys that benefit but all species of animal, bird and plant in the area.

Dr. Sam Shanee said that he hoped these new results would encourage other NGOs and governmental organizations to reach out to local communities in their conservation efforts. Dr. Shanee tells One Green Planet:

“The idea of our work, and community conservation as a whole, is that protecting the environment isn’t something that only governments and big NGO’s can do, it is something that benefits all people and is within reach of all people.”

Working With Locals to Save Wildlife

Dr. Shanee said the cause of deforestation and biodiversity loss was often blamed on local people who were portrayed as the “bad guys.”

He said: “What we continue to find is that with effective discussion of the importance of forests and wildlife many local people not only understand the need for conservation but also become great conservationists leading their communities and, as seen in this study, succeeding in protecting some of the most threatened species and habitats through simple cost-effective solutions where many larger projects/institutions have failed.”

As it appears from this study, protecting an ecosystem means protecting all of the individual parts. If we hope to save any individual species of animal, like the yellow-tail, it requires a complex understanding of the threats to the animals and the intimate ties that the species has to its habitat and the humans who share it. Working to heal the different facets of the issue is the only way to truly achieve a whole success.

0,"On the morning of December 11, 2014, a Russian-built cargo plane touched down unannounced at Cabo Ledo, the military air base south of Angola’s coast-hugging Kissama National Park . Trucks were waiting on the runway.

Packed in the plane’s spacious hold were wooden crates containing wild game from South Africa—one of several shipments of ten species, totaling 215 animals, arranged by Angola’s Ministry of Environment.

As the containers were unloaded, one broke open, freeing a terrified eland that sprinted out across the airfield into the park.

The rest of the animals were trucked to enclosed sections of the park’s Special Conservation Area, apparently to be held there temporarily before being released in other reserves.

The 25,000-acre fenced area was originally set aside for animals airlifted from South Africa in 2000 in what was called Operation Noah’s Ark —a joint Angolan–South African project trumpeted as the start of a groundbreaking restocking of wildlife lost to Angola’s parks during its 27-year-long civil war, which dragged on till 2002.

When the story of the new, hushed-up transfer broke in South Africa’s Mail & Guardian , conservationists were outraged that nonnative species were once again being brought into the park, ignoring guidelines for wildlife reintroductions originally developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the late 1990s.

Angola’s National Icon at Risk

Behavioral biologist Richard Estes was a vehement critic of the indiscriminate transnational mixing of species by Operation Noah’s Ark and says he’s “disgusted” that the same thing is happening again in Kissama.

Estes has conducted fieldwork in Africa for more than 50 years, including a year-long study of the critically endangered giant sable antelope , whose numbers hover at fewer than a hundred.

The spectacular coal-black males of this sable subspecies—revered as Angola’s national animal, a familiar icon on its currency and the tailfins of its airline—carry five-foot-long, scimitar-shaped horns, a foot longer than those of other sables.

Found only in Angola, they survive in two protected areas in the central highlands: Luando Strict Nature Reserve and Cangandala National Park .

In 2009 Angolan biologist Pedro Vaz Pinto pulled off a conservation coup by locating a small remnant population and starting a captive breeding program in Cangandala, where the herd has grown to about 30, helping to pull this legendary creature back from the brink.

Estes says it’s “totally unacceptable” that imported animals might be released alongside the sables.

The theileria/babesia group of protozoal parasites carried by many South African game species can be lethal for them. Symptoms of acute lethargy—drooping ears and lagging behind the herd—are followed by major organ failure and death within days.

The IUCN guidelines stress the need for comprehensive risk assessment before any translocation is undertaken, citing “the record of species moved outside their indigenous ranges that have become invasive aliens, often with extreme adverse impacts.”

Of the 2014 arrivals—kudu, impala, zebra, hartebeest, blesbok, wildebeest, oryx, waterbuck, nyala, eland—all but eland are alien to Kissama. The nyala is known to compete aggressively for browse with bushbuck, a species that’s abundant in the park and will now be at direct risk.

Whose South African Animals, and Why So Secret?

The source of the South African animals remains murky. Tipped off that Nico Roux, a longtime game trader in South Africa’s North West Province was involved in the transfer, National Geographic contacted him.

“The animals belonged to Miguel Ferreira,” Roux said, adding that “he only rented our game facility for the keeping and caretaking” of the animals before they were shipped. (Ferreira, of Exotic Game Breeders in South Africa’s Limpopo Province, was identified in the Mail & Guardian story as the game rancher who supplied the animals for the airlift.)

When asked if the animals indeed had come from his herds and who had paid for them, Ferreira refused to answer, invoking client confidentiality.

But, he said, “everything on my side was totally aboveboard.”

Nothing about this airlift, however, was aboveboard.

On the Angolan side, no announcement was made about it, nor was there an admission that it even took place.

Repeated attempts to reach Fátima Jardim , the environment minister, or any of half a dozen officials who report to her, yielded nothing.

Several South Africans, Namibians, and Angolans with direct knowledge insisted on anonymity, citing worry about compromising their government relationships or fear of reprisals.

Neither South Africa’s Department of Environmental Affairs nor Angola’s Ministry of Agriculture responded to questions about whether the translocation followed export-import protocols for wildlife, including inspection for diseases.

The Gleam of Tourist Gold

According to Ferreira and several sources who asked not to be named, the Ministry of Environment intends to introduce animals into some of the 16 parks and reserves it oversees.

Press reports in 2013-14 out of ANGOP, the country’s official news agency, described the Ministry of Environment’s plans to rebuild Angola’s conservation areas using revenue from ramped-up tourism.

ANGOP reported that Bicuari National Park , in the southwest of the country near Lubango, was initially targeted. Nearly denuded of game during the civil war and the uncontrolled poaching that followed, this largely empty woodland area was singled out for ecotourism efforts that “may provide revenues.”

In March of this year, a provincial official announced that at least a million dollars will be “invested in revamping ecotourism” there, starting with the construction of 20 bungalows, with another 35 to be “added in the second phase.”

Sources say that plans were initiated last fall to bring in a wildlife shipment from Namibia to Bicuari National Park.

Could Cangandala National Park, one of the two last redoubts of the giant sable, be next?

""The ministry knows very well how important the survival of this animal is to the Angolan people,” said biologist Vaz Pinto, adding that the government had “supported or led the various efforts to ensure the breeding and recovery of the species in situ.”

But, he said, turning giant sable habitat “into a zoo-park with additional animals would be against conservation best standards and international guidelines, be unsustainable and a touristic failure, and would probably destroy the giant sable’s chances for recovery—so I'm sure this won't happen.”",Will Secret Wildlife Imports Doom Ultra-Rare Giant Sable?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDE1LzA1LzE1MDUyMS1hbmdvbGEtZ2lhbnQtc2FibGUtYW50ZWxvcGUtb3BlcmF0aW9uLW5vYWhzLWFyay1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2Ev0gGLAWh0dHBzOi8vYXBpLm5hdGlvbmFsZ2VvZ3JhcGhpYy5jb20vZGlzdHJpYnV0aW9uL3B1YmxpYy9hbXAvbmV3cy8yMDE1LzA1LzE1MDUyMS1hbmdvbGEtZ2lhbnQtc2FibGUtYW50ZWxvcGUtb3BlcmF0aW9uLW5vYWhzLWFyay1zb3V0aC1hZnJpY2E?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/2015/05/13/sableantelope/01sableantelope.ngsversion.1432220400556.adapt.1900.1.jpg,2015-05-21,"{'sent': 'On the morning of December 11, 2014, a Russian-built cargo plane touched down unannounced at Cabo Ledo, the military air base south of Angola’s coast-hugging Kissama National Park .', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Angola']}}","On the morning of December 11, 2014, a Russian-built cargo plane touched down unannounced at Cabo Ledo, the military air base south of Angola’s coast-hugging Kissama National Park .

Community conservation projects — initiatives that actively involve local people in conservation efforts — have gained increasing attention in recent years. Yet few studies have examined their success in protecting natural resources. A recent study published in Tropical Conservation Science, Mongabay’s open-access journal, shows that they can indeed work.

The paper, described by the authors as “one of the few existing studies of the impact of locally run, landscape-level conservation initiatives on local fauna,” showed that involving local communities in conservation efforts increased populations of the yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda) near the town of La Esperanza in northeastern Peru.

Both deforestation and a growing human population threaten tropical primates. In the Americas, the yellow-tailed woolly monkey is one of the largest and rarest primate species. It inhabits a small area of moist, high-altitude forest in northeastern Peru. The IUCN lists the species as Critically Endangered, but the number of yellow-tailed woolly monkeys remaining in the wild is unknown.

The Yellow-Tailed Woolly Monkey Project, overseen by the UK-based charity Neotropical Primate Conservation, , promotes conservation of the species through education, the establishment of community-run reserves, reforestation, and the development of income-generating projects for local people. The project, initiated in 2007, assisted local people in establishing a private conservation reserve called La Pampa del Burro. In 2008, community members collectively voted to limit hunting and reduce deforestation, citing values such as concern for future generations, appreciation of spiritual value, and social justice as incentives for these new policies.

To assess whether these measures actually helped protect the monkeys, project scientists conducted field surveys in forests with and without evidence of human disturbance near La Esperanza. Observers walked each of four predetermined transect lines totaling 5.6 miles an average of 38 times. Along the way they recorded monkey sightings, as well as audio and indirect detections from feces or food remains. This survey replicated an earlier one conducted in 2008, soon after the conservation program was implemented. The study also mapped forest cover change over time by examining satellite imagery from 2007 and 2013.

The study documented small, non-significant increases in the number of adult monkeys and the density of monkey groups within the study area over the five-year period following the community-imposed reduction in hunting and deforestation. It also documented significant increases in the size of monkey groups and the number of juveniles and infants, which increased by 21, 53, and 81 percent respectively. The researchers found no significant increase in deforestation within the survey area during this time period, despite the construction of a new road nearby.

The term ""community conservation"" describes initiatives that encourage local ownership and care of natural resources by incorporating and valuing community knowledge. While often focused on small-scale projects, community conservation strategies have the potential to be applied at the landscape level, encompassing entire regions, the authors write.

The study suggests that community conservation can present a compelling alternative to complex and high-cost government programs in Peru, going so far as to state that where the yellow-tailed woolly monkey is concerned such projects “could be the most important factor for the survival of this species.”

0,"Imagine the sight of such as creature and how it must have impressed, perhaps even intimidated our ancestors and inspired stories passed on through generations. Some researchers believe small populations of giganopithecus might have survived to this day and continue to live in remote places, but most scientists reject the theory (11).

A more convincing story that could very well explain the origins of the smelly mythical creature is gigantopithecus, a species of giant apes that roamed the Asian forests some 300,000 years ago. They were the largest documented apes that ever lived on Earth, standing up to 10 feet tall and weighing over 1,000 pounds. Some anthropologists believe gigantopithecus were bipedal (10).

Scientists immediately dismissed the theory for lack of evidence. For starters, the DNA sample Ketchum used had doubtful origins, as it turned to be nothing more than a mix of opossum and other species (9).

In 2013, Dr. Melba Ketchum announced the results of a five-year DNA study – Bigfoot is real, a hybrid species, the result of a crossing between Homo sapiens and an unknown hominin species (8).

Out of the countless sightings and footage that pilled up over these past decades, most are nothing more than hoaxes (7). Yet we can’t help wonder what might have triggered these accounts.

A hairy, ape-like creature roams the North American forests, leaving footprints, hair samples, and traces of a unmistakable stench, camera shy and always on the run. One of the world’s most popular and elusive cryptid monsters, Bigfoot has become a modern phenomenon.

The longest recorded length of a giant squid was 43 feet. It weighed nearly a ton (6), making it one of the largest animals on the planet and obviously a spine tingling sight and a reasonable explanation for all the Kraken stories terrified sailors have brought to land.

This, of course, drew the attention of marine researchers, and in 2005, a team of Japanese scientists managed to capture the first images of a live specimen (4). In 2013, ocean explorers managed to film a giant squid in its natural habitat (5).

The existence of Architeutis dux, the giant squid, has long been shrouded in mystery. They are shy creatures, rarely leaving the seabed, making them extremely hard to study. That was until 2003, when Olivier de Kersauson was sailing off the Portuguese island of Madeira when he noticed a giant squid was clutching to the hull of his boat (3).

The earliest reports of a giant squid come from Aristotle in the 4th century BC (2). More than two millenniums later, Jules Verne described a “squid of colossal dimensions” in his 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

For more than 2,000 years, sailors have told stories of a tentacled beast lurking in the deepest depths of the ocean, devouring whales and tearing ships to pieces. Centuries of folklore and legends describe it as a blood-thirsty mammoth cephalopod, its limbs like lashes able to rip the topmast in a split second (1).

From time to time, fact can be even stranger than fiction. Yet we must bear in mind that exceptional claims require exceptional evidence.

Cryprozoology studies creatures that are rumored to exist. As it happens, some of them actually exist, or at least did at some point in history, and are not even close to being as frightening and blood-thirsty as depicted by folklore.

There’s a fine line between reality and fantasy and it can sometimes be hard to tell which is which, and the imagination of sailors and travelers might have been sparked by actual encounters with real-life creatures, elusive and intriguing nonetheless.

Monsters lurking in darkness of remote forest and caves, on the bottom of the seas and ocean shores, waiting for their next victim, seem like nothing more than bedtime stories. But are they?

3. Mermaids

Sirens, femme fatales that lured sailors to shipwreck and an early sea grave, have long been the subject of marine legends and bedtime stories.

In 1493, Christopher Columbus was sailing the seas around Haiti when he spotted three mermaids. As he came closer, he could see the maidens were not as fair as the legends depicted.

What Columbus actually saw might have been manatees. These flippered-hippo-like aquatic mammals prefer eastuarine or fresh waters.

Their relatives, the dugongs, are a bit slimmer and inhabit the oceans. These two could be the main suspects behind mermaid legends, the lethal maidens with the tail of a fish and body of an attractive woman (10).

Dugongs and manatees are peaceful, grass-eating creatures. But because they sometimes get too close to shore, sailors trying to approach them risk running their ships into rocks.

Mermaid legends were most likely fabled by lonely European sailors as the result of local folklore intermixed with real-life creatures (12).

4. Loch Ness Monster

One of cryptozoology’s greatest enigmas, the Loch Ness Monster continues to stir bitter debates regarding its existence. First encounters date from 565 AD, when a monk known as St. Columba saw the monster preparing to attack a man on the Ness River. This is by no means a historical record, but rather a legend, just like the many more that followed (13).

Sightings have one thing in common. Nessie is described as a long-necked and broad-humped aquatic creature. It certainly fits the description of a plesiosaurus (14).

Believed to have become extinct together with the rest of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous, there are some researchers who believe there might be a slight chance small populations survived (10).

But, the theory of a living plesiosaurus can easily be debunked. Loch Ness was frozen solid during the latest ice ages, plus the cold-blooded dinosaur could not survive for long in the icy waters of the lake (15).

The fearsome monster of the Highlands might be nothing more than a pile of sticks floating on water. As it happened, those sticks had a striking resemblance to a living plesiosaurus (13).

5. Unicorns

They are a habitual presence in fairy tales, children dream of riding one and play with toys resembling their image. It’s safe to say unicorns are not monsters, but they are indeed intriguing mythical creatures.

With different names, unicorns appear in local folklore throughout the globe, as a mighty horse with one single horn in the middle of its forehead, endowed with magical powers (16).

Meet the okapis, a species of bizarre deer-like animals, an unsuspecting combination between a giraffe, zebra, and antelope that inhabit the African rain forests. The male okapi has two antlers which, if seen sideways and from a distance, can easily be mistaken for one horn (10).

Until 1901, only Congo rain forest natives knew of their existence (17), and for centuries, Europeans believed they stood as proof to the existence of unicorns.

Okapis are not the only animals that inspired unicorn legends. Narwhal tusks, the arctic whales with long spiraled tusks, were believed to be the relatives of unicorns and were considered proof to their existence (18).

More recently, in 2008, a baby deer was born with one single horn in the middle of its head at a wildlife preserve in the town of Prato, Italy (22).

6. Cyclops

On his way home from the Trojan War, Odysseus landed on the island of Sicily, where a ferocious cyclops took him and his men prisoners and began devouring them one by one.

These gigantic one-eyed monsters were said to inhabit Mediterranean islands like Crete, Sicily, Ciprus, and Malta. Coincidentally, so did a species of extinct elephants (19).

The islands abound in fossilized skeletons of these dwarf elephants with their massive skulls.

The central nasal cavity for their trunks was positioned right in the middle of their skull, thus giving the impression of a large eye socket, giving birth to the Cyclops myth, a towering monster with a single great eye right in the middle of its face (10).



7. Griffin

The griffin, a mythical creature with the head of an eagle, body of a lion, and razor-sharp claws, owes its existence to Mesopotamian tradition.

Earliest records date back to ancient Egypt. Later, the creature became a regal beast, guardian of precious treasures and royal symbol of wisdom and power.

Meet the protoceratops, a sheep-sized dinosaur that once inhabited the lands now known as Mongolia, a four-legged animal with an enormous head for its size, and an unusual a parrot-like beak.

It’s easy to see how early fossil hunters might have mistaken the dinosaur’s remains for the skeleton of a griffin (10). Protoceratops skeletons can be found all over the Gobi desert.

Folklore historian Adrienne Mayor (20) believes the legend of the Griffin has its origins in ancient gold miners who accidentally came across the fossils of protoceratops, whose fossils seemed to be guarding the precious metal they were trying to exploit (13).

8. Ebu Gobo

There is a legend on the Indonesian island of Flores that tells of short, language-poor, hairy, cave-dwelling creatures that abducted children and spoke in murmurs.

Often told my mothers to children to prevent them from getting too far from home, could there be more to the myth?

Scientists began to study the origins of the myth in 2003. Homo floresiensis is a newly discovered species of extinct humans that inhabited the caves on the island of Flores (10).

Some experts believe these hobbits might be a new link on the human evolutionary tree, and it’s likely they lived alongside humans as recently as 12,000 years ago.

Only one feet tall, they had a brain one third size of normal modern adults. It is quite possible these little people inspired such legends as the Ebu Gobo of Flores. The debate on whether the findings are proof to a completely new species or just humans with abnormally small heads continues (21).

9. The Kappa

Kappa, the “River Imp” of Japanese folklore, are green monkey-faced creatures with an unquenchable appetite for children and cucumbers. These flesh-eating aquatic creatures that drag people and animals to an early watery grave. Luckily, if you behave nicely, they might just spare you (22).

The Japanese giant salamander is often attributed to the origin of the Kappa. It can grow up to five feet in length and can weigh 55 pounds, about the same size as the Kappa, and lives in the waters between the shore and the shallows.

An unsuspecting traveler could easily be surprised at the sight. Fortunately, they are shy creatures and keep their distance.

Perhaps there’s some truth in the myth after all – if you keep your distance, the Kappa will do the same (13).",9 Mythical Creatures and Their Surprising Documented History,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvcHNlY3JldHdyaXRlcnMuY29tLzIwMTUvMDYvOS1teXRoaWNhbC1jcmVhdHVyZXMtYW5kLXRoZWlyLXN1cnByaXNpbmctZG9jdW1lbnRlZC1oaXN0b3J5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.topsecretwriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/giant-octopus-attacking-ship-artist-rendering.jpg,2015-06-23,"{'sent': 'Some researchers believe small populations of giganopithecus might have survived to this day and continue to live in remote places, but most scientists reject the theory (11).\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['11']}}","Imagine the sight of such as creature and how it must have impressed, perhaps even intimidated our ancestors and inspired stories passed on through generations. Some researchers believe small populations of giganopithecus might have survived to this day and continue to live in remote places, but most scientists reject the theory (11).

A more convincing story that could very well explain the origins of the smelly mythical creature is gigantopithecus, a species of giant apes that roamed the Asian forests some 300,000 years ago. They were the largest documented apes that ever lived on Earth, standing up to 10 feet tall and weighing over 1,000 pounds. Some anthropologists believe gigantopithecus were bipedal (10).

Scientists immediately dismissed the theory for lack of evidence. For starters, the DNA sample Ketchum used had doubtful origins, as it turned to be nothing more than a mix of opossum and other species (9).

In 2013, Dr. Melba Ketchum announced the results of a five-year DNA study – Bigfoot is real, a hybrid species, the result of a crossing between Homo sapiens and an unknown hominin species (8).

This article is more than 4 years old

Scientists have welcomed the first results of a captive breeding program aimed at saving a group of critically endangered Fijian crested iguanas, the first such attempt to reintroduce a species in that country.

Some of the iguanas that were introduced to the Fijian island of Monuriki two months ago have been tracked down by scientists and appear to be healthy.



A total of 32 iguanas were microchipped and released, with tiny radio transmitters glued to the tails of 11 for tracking purposes. Nine were recovered on Sunday.



US Geological Survey biologist Robert Fisher reported all had increased in length and lost their excessive weight. A lean diet of native plants had evidently “sorted them out,” he said. There was no evidence of trauma or other health issues.

This is the first time Fiji has bred an endangered species in captivity and introduced it into the wild, with the National Trust for Fiji implementing a 2010 International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) species recovery plan.

Fijian crested iguanas are endemic to only a handful of islands. Peter Harlow, an ecologist at Sydney’s Taronga zoo and member of the program’s steering committee, said the islands had never been connected to a continental land mass, and were formed through volcanic eruptions millions of years ago.

Galápagos Islands volcanic eruption could threaten pink iguana species Read more

The iguanas’ closest relatives live more than 8,000km away in the Galapagos Islands and south-western North America, making their ancestry “one of the great mysteries” of ecology, he said. “The only possible way [the iguanas] could have reached there was by rafting or floating across the Pacific [Ocean].”

While about 12,000 iguanas live on the protected sanctuary island of Yadua Taba, numbers on neighbouring Monuriki have been in rapid decline. They feed on the island’s native plants, which were severely degraded by forest burning and the introduction of goats in the 1960s by the traditional owners, the Mataqali Vunaivi.

The iguanas had a brush with conservationist fame in 1994, when Steve and Terri Irwin visited Monuriki and Tokoriki to search for the elusive population. During a 12-day stay they encountered only three caged individuals.

Harlow first surveyed the iguanas in 1998 and found fewer than 80 individuals and no juveniles. In 2010 a recovery plan was finally implemented, with 21 iguanas captured and removed over a two-year period by the National Trust of Fiji and taken to the captive breeding facilities at Kula Eco Park.

Eight males and nine females successfully reproduced at the park. At the same time, the Mataqali Vunaivi people began eradicating the goats from the island. Restoration work has led to the recovery of the island’s unique dry forest.

Iguanas play a villainous role in local Fijian mythology, but shifting cultural attitudes have led to a new commitment to conservation. A spokesman for the Mataqali Vunaivi people, Ratu Maika Ratu, called the program a blessing.

“This project has made us realise how important it is to protect the island, for our children’s livelihood in the future and also for this very special iguana, the sea birds and other plants and animals that live in it,” he said.

Fijian crested iguanas are a vivid green, but have the ability to change colour and become very difficult to spot when living in treetops. They grow to about 75cm from nose to tail tip, and have strong legs and sharp claws, making them excellent climbers.

They are also herbivores, eating leaves, fruits, shoots and flowers, and are “vital seed distributors”, Harlow said, digesting plants such as the Pacific hibiscus and Tahitian chestnut, and spreading their seeds across the island.

New and rejuvenated populations of birdlife such as the buff-banded rail and the wedge-tailed shearwater have also been spotted on the island thanks to rejuvenation of the forests.

The director and manager of the breeding program at Kula Eco Park, Ramesh Chand, called it a “proud moment”.

“By allowing us to remove a few of the remaining iguanas and breed new stock from them, the traditional landowners have potentially saved a piece of Fiji’s natural heritage from extinction.”",Iguana captive breeding program in Fiji posts first positive results,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L2p1bC8xNC9pZ3VhbmEtY2FwdGl2ZS1icmVlZGluZy1wcm9ncmFtLWluLWZpamktcG9zdHMtZmlyc3QtcG9zaXRpdmUtcmVzdWx0c9IBcmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnRoZWd1YXJkaWFuLmNvbS93b3JsZC8yMDE1L2p1bC8xNC9pZ3VhbmEtY2FwdGl2ZS1icmVlZGluZy1wcm9ncmFtLWluLWZpamktcG9zdHMtZmlyc3QtcG9zaXRpdmUtcmVzdWx0cw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5205e8835f7f32d2a2e9d7b1a9ccd35d50f78d9f/0_39_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ccbe0dbbc34645fbc58603d5c1bb07be,2015-07-14,"{'sent': 'A group of endangered iguanas introduced to the Fijian island of Monuriki two months ago have been tracked down and appear to be healthy\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Monuriki']}}","A group of endangered iguanas introduced to the Fijian island of Monuriki two months ago have been tracked down and appear to be healthy

Iguanas play a villainous role in local Fijian mythology, but shifting cultural attitudes have led to a new commitment to conservation. A spokesman for the Mataqali Vunaivi people, Ratu Maika Ratu, called the program a blessing.

“This project has made us realise how important it is to protect the island, for our children’s livelihood in the future and also for this very special iguana, the sea birds and other plants and animals that live in it,” he said.

Fijian crested iguanas are a vivid green, but have the ability to change colour and become very difficult to spot when living in treetops. They grow to about 75cm from nose to tail tip, and have strong legs and sharp claws, making them excellent climbers.

They are also herbivores, eating leaves, fruits, shoots and flowers, and are “vital seed distributors”, Harlow said, digesting plants such as the Pacific hibiscus and Tahitian chestnut, and spreading their seeds across the island.

New and rejuvenated populations of birdlife such as the buff-banded rail and the wedge-tailed shearwater have also been spotted on the island thanks to rejuvenation of the forests.

The director and manager of the breeding program at Kula Eco Park, Ramesh Chand, called it a “proud moment”.

“By allowing us to remove a few of the remaining iguanas and breed new stock from them, the traditional landowners have potentially saved a piece of Fiji’s natural heritage from extinction.”","[{'Fijian', 'NORP'}, {'Monuriki', 'NORP'}, {'DATE', 'two months ago'}, {'DATE', 'more than 4 years old'}, {'DATE', 'more than 4 years old'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'Fijian', 'NORP'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'Fijian', 'NORP'}, {'Monuriki', 'NORP'}, {'DATE', 'two months ago'}, {'CARDINAL', '32'}, {'CARDINAL', '11'}, {'CARDINAL', 'Nine'}, {'DATE', 'Sunday'}, {'US', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Robert Fisher'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'Fiji', 'GPE'}, {'the National Trust for Fiji', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', '2010'}, {'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'EVENT'}, {'Fijian', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Peter Harlow'}, {'Sydney’s Taronga', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', 'millions of years ago'}, {'Galápagos Islands', 'GPE'}, {'iguana', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', 'more than'}, {'QUANTITY', '8,000km'}, {'the Galapagos Islands', 'LOC'}, {'North America', 'LOC'}, {'Pacific', 'LOC'}, {'about 12,000', 'CARDINAL'}, {'Yadua Taba', 'GPE'}, {'Monuriki', 'NORP'}, {'DATE', 'the 1960s'}, {'the Mataqali Vunaivi', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', '1994'}, {'PERSON', 'Steve'}, {'Terri Irwin', 'PERSON'}, {'Monuriki', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Tokoriki'}, {'DATE', '12-day'}, {'CARDINAL', 'only three'}, {'DATE', '1998'}, {'fewer than 80', 'CARDINAL'}, {'DATE', '2010'}, {'21', 'CARDINAL'}, {'DATE', 'two-year'}, {'the National Trust of Fiji', 'ORG'}, {'FAC', 'Kula Eco Park'}, {'CARDINAL', 'Eight'}, {'CARDINAL', 'nine'}, {'ORG', 'Mataqali Vunaivi'}, {'Iguanas', 'ORG'}, {'Fijian', 'NORP'}, {'ORG', 'Mataqali Vunaivi'}, {'Ratu Maika Ratu', 'ORG'}, {'iguana', 'ORG'}, {'Fijian', 'NORP'}, {'CARDINAL', 'about 75'}, {'PERSON', 'Harlow'}, {'Pacific', 'LOC'}, {'NORP', 'Tahitian'}, {'buff', 'ORG'}, {'FAC', 'Kula Eco Park'}, {'Ramesh Chand', 'GPE'}, {'Fiji', 'GPE'}]","['Fijian', 'Monuriki', 'Fijian', 'Fijian', 'Monuriki', 'US', 'Fiji', 'the National Trust for Fiji', 'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'Fijian', 'Sydney’s Taronga', 'Galápagos Islands', 'iguana', 'the Galapagos Islands', 'North America', 'Pacific', 'Yadua Taba', 'Monuriki', 'the Mataqali Vunaivi', 'Monuriki', 'the National Trust of Fiji', 'Mataqali Vunaivi', 'Iguanas', 'Fijian', 'Mataqali Vunaivi', 'Ratu Maika Ratu', 'iguana', 'Fijian', 'Pacific', 'Tahitian', 'buff', 'Ramesh Chand', 'Fiji']"

Ash Dykes, the 24-year-old British adventurer who earned his nickname last year while trekking 1,500 miles across Mongolia, is off this month on his latest solo expedition.

This time around he plans to walk 1,800 miles across the island nation of Madagascar. Along the way, he’ll climb eight mountain ranges, cross a desert, encounter dangerous crocodiles, and hopefully get a chance to see the elusive and extremely rare northern sportive lemur.

Only about 50 of these critically endangered primates remain, so Dykes could be one of the few human beings to see one alive in recent years.

“I really hope I see one,” he said over Skype in the hours before hopping a plane to Madagascar. “I’m quite excited about it.”

Will luck be on his side? “I think he might see one,” said Lynne Venart, communications director for the Lemur Conservation Network, the organization that has partnered with Dykes for the expedition. “Their range is not that big. That’s why there are so few of them.”

Venart said that many of Madagascar’s once-vibrant forests have been chopped or burned down over the past decade, a time of economic and political turmoil. Habitats for the northern sportive lemur and many other species have been dramatically reduced or completely destroyed. More than 90 percent of Madagascar’s species exist nowhere else on Earth, and many of these animals are projected to go extinct over the next 25 years.

Dykes had started planning his Madagascar trip when the Lemur Conservation Network approached him about using it as an opportunity to raise awareness about lemurs and the country’s deforestation. “Of course I jumped at the opportunity,” he said. “I thought, if I can do it for a good cause and spread some awareness, absolutely.”

The adventurer documented similar environmental degradation during his trip to Mongolia.

“Global warming has hit pretty hard there,” he said. “Summer’s more extreme, and the winter is colder than it ever used to be. Livestock just can’t handle that temperature anymore, so they die off, which means the nomads who live out there can’t really fend for themselves, and they’re forced to move to the capital city, Ulaanbaatar.” There, people have surrounded the city with communities made up of tents; to keep warm they’re forced to burn plastic, dirty coal, or whatever else they can find. “That’s something I was clueless about until I went over to Mongolia,” Dykes said.

The environmental highs and lows he encounters while on expedition embody Dykes’ philosophy about his adventures. “I always say, when you travel, soak up the wonder, the beauty, but of course, don’t ignore the devastation that does go on as well.”

In addition to lemurs—he’s likely to encounter several of the more than 100 lemur species along his journey—Dykes said he is looking forward to seeing a lot of Madagascar’s other wildlife, including chameleons, butterflies, and yes, even crocodiles. “Not too closely, though,” he said, laughing. “They’re quite badass.”

Dykes’ journey is expected to take about five months. Along the way, he’ll post photos and updates to his Facebook page and Twitter, as well as videos to his YouTube channel. “I’ll do what I can and share stories from within Madagascar with the rest of the world,” he said.","Adventurer Is Walking 1,800 Miles to Find Madagascar’s Rarest Lemur",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHA6Ly93d3cudGFrZXBhcnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAxNS8wOS8wMy9hZHZlbnR1cmVyLXdhbGtpbmctMTgwMC1taWxlcy1maW5kLW1hZGFnYXNjYXJzLXJhcmVzdC1sZW11ctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/northern%20sportive%20lemur.jpg,2015-09-03,"{'sent': 'The “Lonely Snow Leopard” is looking for the world’s loneliest lemur.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['The “Lonely Snow Leopard']}}","The “Lonely Snow Leopard” is looking for the world’s loneliest lemur.

0,"With more bird species than any country in the world, Colombia is a birdwatching paradise. Chris Bell takes a look at some of the best places to go to catch a glimpse of some spectacular feathered friends

There are many things that spring to people’s minds when they think of Colombia – some positive, some negative, some fair and some unfair. What non-birders may not know is that the country is deservedly world famous for its remarkable diversity of birds. Birdwatching is big business these days and Colombia, after organising its first-ever Bird Fair in Cali earlier this year, is poised to make the most of its remarkable bird diversity. The country occupies less than 1% of the world’s total land surface, yet it boasts a staggering 18% of all known bird species on earth.

In 2013, Colombia became the first country on earth to register more than 1,900 bird species, and as the more isolated regions of the country open up to scientists and birders it won’t be long until it hits the 2,000 mark. These are quite astounding statistics, which not only prove the remarkable biodiversity of the country, but also completely justify Colombia’s reputation as one of the best places in the world to watch birds.

You don’t need to be an expert or a full-on birding enthusiast to enjoy Colombia’s wealth of species – there are numerous fantastic places to visit, from the coastal mountains of the Caribbean to the deep Amazon jungles of the south. Many of them are catered to by excellent lodges and protected by ProAves, a Colombian NGO dedicated to the conservation of birds and their habitats. Here are some of the best of them, so you can get out there for yourself, explore the country, and appreciate the true treasures that are Colombia’s birds:

El Dorado Reserve and the San Lorenzo Ridge, Magdalena

High in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, surrounded by panoramic views of the sparkling Caribbean Sea and Colombia’s highest mountains, the snow-capped Pico Colon and Bolivar, sits the ProAves El Dorado Bird Reserve and the San Lorenzo Ridge. This is a mecca for birders worldwide because of its remarkable number of endemic species. The Sierra Nevada might be a small area, but it holds the highest concentration of native birds in the world, and at least 20 are regularly seen here, including the beautiful Santa Marta Parakeet and the elusive Santa Marta Antpitta. El Dorado has a well-appointed lodge and a number of excellent bilingual guides; a day visit from Minca is possible (with a very early start) for those on a tighter budget.

Los Flamencos, La Guajira

Staying up on the Caribbean coast, the road to the most northerly point of South America is home to the small town of Camarones, which protects the Los Flamencos National Park, home to, you guessed it, a colony of American Flamingos, as well as a wealth of other beautiful aquatic and desert species. The striking Vermillion Cardinal and the almost impossibly elusive Tocuyo Sparrow call the surrounding scrubland home. A trip by canoe to the flamingos will also yield Scarlet Ibis, Reddish Egret and Wood Stork, and many migratory North American species between November and April.

Cerro Montezuma, Chocó

This birding lodge, located in the stunning Tatama National Park, is the ying to El Dorado’s yang: if the previous reserve is the well-known, popular hot-spot for great birding, then Montezuma is the hidden jewel on the lips of birders worldwide. Located in Colombia’s Western Cordillera but, crucially, within the Chocó bioregion, visitors to Montezuma can expect to notch up hundreds of ticks within just a couple of days birding. Home to several much sought after endemics, such as the iconic Black-and-gold and Gold-ringed Tanagers and the Chocó Tapaculo and Warbler, Montezuma is off the beaten track, but all the more rewarding for it.

Finca Alejandria, Km. 18, Cali, Valle del Cauca

If the previous site is a huge, forested national park, protecting a wealth of habitat, and hundreds of species, this next birding spot is comparatively modest; but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in diversity. 18km down the road over the mountains from Cali to the Pacific coast, a small road branches off into the forest, leading to this secluded little finca. The owners, Raúl and Elsa, have set up hummingbird and banana feeders and have succeeded in attracting a wealth of stunning Pacific jungle bird species. However, the real reason to visit this place can be summed up in just two words: Multicoloured Tanager. This otherwise almost impossible to see endemic has chosen to become a regular visitor to the banana feeders and is basically guaranteed: a once-in-a-lifetime tick!

Termales del Ruiz, Los Nevados National Park, Caldas

Like Finca Alejandria, this is a very small place (just a hotel and thermal baths in the mountains of Los Nevados National Park) that has become iconic due to the birds that visit its feeders. Its enviable location on the frontier of paramo and Andean cloud-forest means that Termales’ hummingbird feeders attract ten regular species, including the endemic Buffy Helmetcrest. Other possible sightings include the second largest hummingbird in the world, and the Sword-billed Hummingbird: the only bird in the world whose bill is longer than its body! Throw in the stunning male Rainbow-bearded Thornbill, and regular visits from mountain toucans, and Termales is a very special birding site to visit for the day.

Rio Blanco Reserve, near Manizales

On your visit to Caldas to explore the hummingbirds of Termales, make time for a day at Rio Blanco Reserve, just half an hour outside Manizales. Run by Aguas de Manizales, and with somewhat random opening hours, Rio Blanco is nonetheless worth the difficulties in visiting for one reason: Antpittas. These shy, ground-dwelling species are plentiful in Colombia, but notoriously difficult (nay impossible) to see in most places however, in Rio Blanco the five resident species of Antpitta have learned to visit live-worm feeding stations, making special views of these timid birds virtually guaranteed. This makes Rio Blanco a must-visit reserve for the serious lister.

Jardin, Antioquia

This delightful little pueblo, about four hours south of Medellin, is an increasingly popular tourist destination, but it’s a wonderful place for birding as well. Just outside of the town is the real reason for visiting Jardin: an easily accessible Andean Cock-of-the-Rock lek (a lek is a communal courtship site) where at dusk and dawn large groups of these strange, bright red birds come to display for females. This species can be almost impossible to see outside of a lekking site, and Jardin is perhaps the easiest place in South America to observe them. Additionally, the mountains around the town are home to the ProAves Yellow-eared Parrot Reserve, which shelters a strong population of 300 or so of these recently rediscovered, macaw-like endemic parrots.

Around Bogotá

Some of you may be reading this and thinking: “I like birds, but I’m not travelling two days up a Pacific coast mountain to look for them!” Never fear, there are plenty of excellent birding spots just hours from Colombia’s capital, and even within the city itself. The reeds and ponds of La Florida Park, near the airport, can yield the endemic Bogotá Rail and Apolinar’s Wren, and the Botanical Gardens are excellent for spotting migratory species between November and April. A bit further afield, the Jardin Encantado hummingbird garden in San Francisco offers sightings of the Ruby Topaz, the Gorgeted Woodstar and the Andean Emerald, whilst paramos like Chingaza and Sumapaz are home to a number of unique hummingbird and raptor species, including the Andean Condor, Colombia’s national bird.

0,"When the artist Ralph Steadman talks about birds, the word “vicious” comes up repeatedly. Crows are vicious. Peacocks, too. Birds generally, really. “There’s nothing sentimental about them,” Steadman said when he spoke with me on Skype last month from his studio in Kent, England. And their human admirers aren’t the gentlest of creatures, either, for that matter. “Bird lovers are really an unpleasant people,” he observed brightly. “They have to get rid of their inner turmoil and frustration.”

Before taking offense, there are a few things to consider in Steadman’s defense. The first is that, well, he’s Ralph Steadman—pioneer of ""gonzo"" journalism, whose work with longtime collaborator Hunter S. Thompson fused Thompson’s drug-soaked storytelling with Steadman’s feverish, comically sinister illustrations to expose the disingenuousness of politicians and the hypocrisy of American moralism. In other words, viciousness, turmoil, and frustration are Steadman’s bread and butter. And the second is the fact that “bird lovers” is a category into which Steadman himself firmly falls, whether or not he cares to admit it—so much so that he’s done not one but two books of bird illustrations, the second of which, Nextinction, will be released in the U.S. next week by Bloomsbury.

Nextinction is a collaboration with filmmaker and conservationist Ceri Levy and it’s a sequel of sorts to their first book together, 2012’s Extinct Boids, a book of illustrations of extinct species both real and fantastical (those would be the “boids”). For Nextinction, the pair took on species that are in danger of going the same route.

Like Extinct Boids, Nextinction has the feel of a Victorian ornithological encyclopedia that’s been shoved through the looking glass (or some hallucinogen-saturated Instagram filter). Each of Steadman’s 150-or-so illustrations of endangered and critically endangered birds are accompanied by a write-up from Levy explaining how the species found itself on the list. But then there’s also a running plot: The books take place on the mythical Toadstool Island, where birds are stalked by a sinister hunter and his band of henchmen, “the blue-panted bird-killers.” The world of Nextinction is also populated by an amalgam of real and imagined species, which have been given interconnecting backstories by Levy: The Spoon-billed Sandpiper and the Waved Albatross coexist with the Unsociable Leftwing and the Blue-Beaked Waddle, as well as the never-seen but often-mentioned Brrrddd (a Scot), who supplies the island's boids with moonshine. (“I made some up because they're so easily make-upable,"" Steadman said. ""It’s a funny thing—you can put a beak on anything and it does look like a bird.”)

For all his talk of viciousness, Steadman, who’s 79, is warm and charmingly daffy in a way that only the British grandfathers of my imagination can be, except that instead of telling stories about the war, Steadman’s stories are about the time he and Hunter S. Thompson traveled to Zaire to cover the Ali-Foreman Rumble in the Jungle for Rolling Stone. (Thompson sold their tickets to the fight, bought a pair of elephant tusks, and then set off a customs chase when he tried to smuggle them back into the U.S.)

Four decades later, you could say Steadman is having something of a moment, with the boids books, the release last year of a documentary about him called For No Good Reason, and the publication of Proud to Be Weirrd, a massive monograph of his work. But he’s never stopped working: His unmistakable illustrations have appeared everywhere from book covers to postage stamps to beer bottles (he does the labels for Flying Dog Brewery), and a few years ago he started doing political caricatures again after taking a hiatus in the late '90s, when he grew so sick of British politicians that he decided from then on he’d only draw their legs. (Which isn’t to suggest that he’s any more impressed by the new crop—“all these awful Eton bubble faces.”)

But Steadman first dipped into the bird world thanks to Levy, a documentarian who years ago decided to make a film about the weird obsessiveness of birdwatchers, only to realize that he himself had become one of the afflicted. (He’s currently finishing up a documentary about the effect birds have on people.) In 2010, Levy, by then firmly ensconced in the conservation realm, approached Steadman about doing an illustration of an extinct bird for a fundraising exhibit. Steadman responded that he didn’t think he’d ever drawn a bird before, then went back through his archives and discovered that he had in fact drawn dozens of them, whether as a motif in a political cartoon, say, or simply as a little blot with wings, knocked off and quickly forgotten. “You can be interested in lots of things without realizing that interest,” said Steadman, who these days keeps tabs on his local blackbirds and bullfinches from a picture window in his kitchen and calls himself “the guano collector” thanks to the abundance of their gifts.

From that initial meeting, the first book was born, and Steadman and Levy became, as they say, “gonzovationists.” Levy views the collaboration as an opportunity to infuse the conservation world with some much-needed fresh air. “What I see conservation really struggling with at the moment is having alternative voices, away from the conservation world, coming and speaking up on behalf on wildlife,” said Levy, 54, who joined us on Skype and did an admirable job of wrangling Steadman when he wandered too far from the matter at hand. (The same dynamic plays out in a sidebar running throughout Nextinction that includes transcripts of phone and email exchanges between Levy and Steadman during the creation of the book.)

Steadman sees the challenge in simpler terms: If you want to hold the public’s interest, he said, “You’ve got to make people laugh.”

It took a year and a half to make Nextinction. Levy would send Steadman lists of endangered birds in batches, to avoid overwhelming him, and Steadman would then look at pictures online for reference. But when Steadman illustrates a bird, the point isn’t visual facsimile. “Often you see pictures of birds where there’s no character, no personality,” said Levy. “What Ralph has done is he’s injected personality into the bird, and that creates a real bond” between bird and viewer. Take, for example, Steadman’s Red-headed Vulture, a meaty thud of a bird standing defiantly on top of an eviscerated something-or-other. “Why me???” thinks the carrion, via thought bubble. “Just clearing up the mess!!—Nothin’ personal!!” the vulture replies.

It’s true that Steadman’s birds aren't exactly the ethereal creatures of poetry, stylistically speaking (even his graceful cranes come off as a touch deranged). Even so, for someone who made his name with illustrations that radiated anger and contempt, Steadman's current choice of subject matter may lead some to worry he's gone mushy in his older years, or maybe just that he's finally without a clear target for his brush. But you don’t have to dig too deep to find a through-line between the venality Steadman excoriated in the 1970s and the casual knocking off of an entire species to make room for another Ford dealership or Cheesecake Factory. “I think that’s why you enjoy doing the birds,” Levy said to Steadman. “It’s still raging against everything that’s wrong.”","Inside Ralph Steadman's Gonzo World of ""Nextinct"" Birds",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1ZHVib24ub3JnL25ld3MvaW5zaWRlLXJhbHBoLXN0ZWFkbWFucy1nb256by13b3JsZC1uZXh0aW5jdC1iaXJkc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.audubon.org/sites/default/files/styles/hero_mobile/public/editorial-card-images/article/ec_sfw_dodos.jpg?itok=md5uiv23,2015-09-10,"{'sent': 'When the artist Ralph Steadman talks about birds, the word “vicious” comes up repeatedly.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Ralph Steadman']}}","When the artist Ralph Steadman talks about birds, the word “vicious” comes up repeatedly.

0,"What do you after completing the world’s first unsupported trek across Mongolia? Well, if you’re Welsh adventurer, Ash Dykes, you walk the length of Madagascar to help publicize the plight of vanishing lemurs.

On September 7th, Ash Dykes arrived at Cape Sainte Marie on the southern tip of Madagascar. He gazed over the vast Indian Ocean before turning north along the coast. Over the next five months, 24-year-old Dykes from the village of Old Colwyn in Wales, plans to walk the entire length of Madagascar: trekking 2,900 kilometres of desert, rainforest and mountains in one of the world’s most unusual landscapes.

“Madagascar is rarely talked about. Everyone has heard of it, but it’s not your typical destination,” Dykes said. “This is what attracts me to take on these remote locations.”

But Dykes isn’t tackling Madagascar just for the challenge; he’s also partnering with the Lemur Conservation Network to bring attention to what is arguably the most bizarre and wonderful mix of flora and fauna in the world. Scientists believe that 70-90% of Madagascar’s species – including all those lemurs – are found no-where else on the planet.

“As I trek across Madagascar, I will help the Lemur Conservation Network by raising awareness about Madagascar’s unique biodiversity...and to share stories about the people working on the ground in Madagascar to protect lemurs and other wildlife and their habitat,” Dykes said, who be meeting with some of Madagascar’s top conservation scientists as he makes his way north.

This isn’t Dykes’ first great adventure: he recently won the UK’s Adventurer of the Year award for Wales for a 2014 trek across Mongolia. He was the first person to cross the country solo and unsupported, hiking 2,400 kilometres while dragging a self-designed trailer for his equipment behind him.



This time Dykes will rely on a series of guides throughout his trek. But, if he succeeds in Madagascar, he’ll become the first person to traverse the full-length of the country, notching another record-breaking feat on his belt.

Lemurs and Others

During his five-month excursion, Dykes expects to see lots of wildlife, including lemurs, chameleons, scorpions, frogs, butterflies and crocodiles (“not too close though!” he noted). But what he hopes most to see is the incredibly-elusive, almost-mythic northern sportive lemur.

“[It is] the rarest of the lemur species, with only around 50 left – which is a huge shame!” he said. “If I do spot it, then I’ll take note of my coordinates and inform the conservationists of my location and time of sighting. I’m hoping it’s in an area that it hasn’t yet been sighted.”

Madagascar is, of course, most famous for its lemurs. To date, scientists have documented 103 species of lemurs living on an island twice the size of the United Kingdom. And new species of this ancient primate family are still declared every couple years.

“Most people know the ring-tailed lemur, and perhaps the mouse lemurs or the ruffed lemurs, but the diversity of lemurs on Madagascar is so much greater, and a fascinating study on evolution and adaptation,” said Lynne Venart, the Communications Director of the Lemur Conservation Network.



When you go on a hike in Madagascar, every couple of steps you see a weird and wonderful creature. Lynne Venart

The group, launched in February, helps put donors (even small ones) in touch with 50-plus conservation groups doing the tough work on the ground to save lemurs from extinction.



Currently, the IUCN Red List classifies an incredible 91% of the world’s lemurs as threatened with extinction, putting them at the foreground of the world’s biodiversity crisis. In response, scientists produced a nationwide plan to safeguard the most vulnerable lemurs from extinction. The total cost is less than £5 million, but funding is still lacking.

Lemurs are just one part of the story of Madagascar’s wildlife. Madagascar also contains giant geckos that blend-in perfectly with tree bark, giant silk moths ,a weevil with a neck so long it’s named after the giraffe, plump baobab trees, chameleons so small they fit on a human fingernail and hedgehog-like mammals that can give birth to 30-plus babies (tenrecs) among a slew of other biological oddities and wonders.

“When you go on a hike in Madagascar, every couple of steps you see a weird and wonderful creature that is completely endemic to Madagascar,” said Venart. “It truly is amazing!”

Poverty and Hope

But Madagascar’s natural treasures are increasingly imperiled by human pressures.

One of the world’s poorest countries, Madagascar is home to 22 million people and its population is rapidly rising (growing at 2.8% annually). More than half of this population lives on $2 a day and about half the children in the country under five suffer from malnutrition. The country is also experiencing a youth bulge: the median age of the population is just 19.5.

For centuries, locals have followed an agricultural practice known locally as tavy where they cut and burn down forest to plant crops. When the nutrient-poor soil collapses, they move into other forests. Although researchers continue to debate how much forest the country had prior to human arrival, there is no debate that Madagascar has lost about half of its forests since 1950, largely to this style of shifting agriculture.

“You can’t blame the poor, rural Malagasy for wanting to feed their families, whether that is by hunting lemurs, or burning down the forest to grow rice or make charcoal to cook their food,” said Venart. “So, conservation in Madagascar can’t just be about studying the animals, establishing national parks, putting up field stations, or replanting trees. Education, alternative cooking fuels, and alternative ways for the Malagasy to make an income are key.”

Conservationists in Madagascar, therefore, often find themselves enacting a variety of roles from educators to sustainable development designers.

“People all over the world can support the work of these conservation organisations by donating or volunteering,” said Venart, who pointed to the Lemur Conservation Network website for more information. “Another simple way to help is to talk about these issues with your friends, family, and colleagues, and help raise the overall global consciousness of Madagascar and its conservation challenges...If we can solve these issues in Madagascar for these people and this wildlife, I bet we can solve them anywhere.”

A number of devoted conservationists have been working in Madagascar for decades, yet the plight of the country – both its ecological issues and its continued poverty – have largely gone unnoticed by the global public. Even the wildly-popular DreamWorks’ Madagascar film series (and spin-offs), has seemingly done little to raise the nation’s profile.

Still, Venart is hopeful that the relentless dedication of conservationists will keep Madagascar’s wildlife from extinction and that new ways of telling Madagascar’s story – such as through Dykes’ great trek – will bring a larger global audience to the country.

“There is too much to lose, and no hurdle is too high,” said Venart. “There are a lot of really great conservation organisations and scientists on the ground in Madagascar working to protect its wildlife and help the local people. They need the support of the world.”

On September 7th, Ash Dykes arrived at Cape Sainte Marie on the southern tip of Madagascar. He gazed over the vast Indian Ocean before turning north along the coast. Over the next five months, 24-year-old Dykes from the village of Old Colwyn in Wales, plans to walk the entire length of Madagascar: trekking 2,900 kilometres of desert, rainforest and mountains in one of the world’s most unusual landscapes.

“Madagascar is rarely talked about. Everyone has heard of it, but it’s not your typical destination,” Dykes said. “This is what attracts me to take on these remote locations.”

But Dykes isn’t tackling Madagascar just for the challenge; he’s also partnering with the Lemur Conservation Network to bring attention to what is arguably the most bizarre and wonderful mix of flora and fauna in the world. Scientists believe that 70-90% of Madagascar’s species – including all those lemurs – are found no-where else on the planet.

“As I trek across Madagascar, I will help the Lemur Conservation Network by raising awareness about Madagascar’s unique biodiversity...and to share stories about the people working on the ground in Madagascar to protect lemurs and other wildlife and their habitat,” Dykes said, who be meeting with some of Madagascar’s top conservation scientists as he makes his way north.

This isn’t Dykes’ first great adventure: he recently won the UK’s Adventurer of the Year award for Wales for a 2014 trek across Mongolia. He was the first person to cross the country solo and unsupported, hiking 2,400 kilometres while dragging a self-designed trailer for his equipment behind him.



This time Dykes will rely on a series of guides throughout his trek. But, if he succeeds in Madagascar, he’ll become the first person to traverse the full-length of the country, notching another record-breaking feat on his belt.

Lemurs and Others

During his five-month excursion, Dykes expects to see lots of wildlife, including lemurs, chameleons, scorpions, frogs, butterflies and crocodiles (“not too close though!” he noted). But what he hopes most to see is the incredibly-elusive, almost-mythic northern sportive lemur.

“[It is] the rarest of the lemur species, with only around 50 left – which is a huge shame!” he said. “If I do spot it, then I’ll take note of my coordinates and inform the conservationists of my location and time of sighting. I’m hoping it’s in an area that it hasn’t yet been sighted.”

Madagascar is, of course, most famous for its lemurs. To date, scientists have documented 103 species of lemurs living on an island twice the size of the United Kingdom. And new species of this ancient primate family are still declared every couple years.

“Most people know the ring-tailed lemur, and perhaps the mouse lemurs or the ruffed lemurs, but the diversity of lemurs on Madagascar is so much greater, and a fascinating study on evolution and adaptation,” said Lynne Venart, the Communications Director of the Lemur Conservation Network.

The group, launched in February, helps put donors (even small ones) in touch with 50-plus conservation groups doing the tough work on the ground to save lemurs from extinction.



Currently, the IUCN Red List classifies an incredible 91% of the world’s lemurs as threatened with extinction, putting them at the foreground of the world’s biodiversity crisis. In response, scientists produced a nationwide plan to safeguard the most vulnerable lemurs from extinction. The total cost is less than £5 million, but funding is still lacking.

Lemurs are just one part of the story of Madagascar’s wildlife. Madagascar also contains giant geckos that blend-in perfectly with tree bark, giant silk moths ,a weevil with a neck so long it’s named after the giraffe, plump baobab trees, chameleons so small they fit on a human fingernail and hedgehog-like mammals that can give birth to 30-plus babies (tenrecs) among a slew of other biological oddities and wonders.

“When you go on a hike in Madagascar, every couple of steps you see a weird and wonderful creature that is completely endemic to Madagascar,” said Venart. “It truly is amazing!”

Poverty and Hope

But Madagascar’s natural treasures are increasingly imperiled by human pressures.

One of the world’s poorest countries, Madagascar is home to 22 million people and its population is rapidly rising (growing at 2.8% annually). More than half of this population lives on $2 a day and about half the children in the country under five suffer from malnutrition. The country is also experiencing a youth bulge: the median age of the population is just 19.5.

For centuries, locals have followed an agricultural practice known locally as tavy where they cut and burn down forest to plant crops. When the nutrient-poor soil collapses, they move into other forests. Although researchers continue to debate how much forest the country had prior to human arrival, there is no debate that Madagascar has lost about half of its forests since 1950, largely to this style of shifting agriculture.

“You can’t blame the poor, rural Malagasy for wanting to feed their families, whether that is by hunting lemurs, or burning down the forest to grow rice or make charcoal to cook their food,” said Venart. “So, conservation in Madagascar can’t just be about studying the animals, establishing national parks, putting up field stations, or replanting trees. Education, alternative cooking fuels, and alternative ways for the Malagasy to make an income are key.”

Conservationists in Madagascar, therefore, often find themselves enacting a variety of roles from educators to sustainable development designers.

“People all over the world can support the work of these conservation organisations by donating or volunteering,” said Venart, who pointed to the Lemur Conservation Network website for more information. “Another simple way to help is to talk about these issues with your friends, family, and colleagues, and help raise the overall global consciousness of Madagascar and its conservation challenges...If we can solve these issues in Madagascar for these people and this wildlife, I bet we can solve them anywhere.”

A number of devoted conservationists have been working in Madagascar for decades, yet the plight of the country – both its ecological issues and its continued poverty – have largely gone unnoticed by the global public. Even the wildly-popular DreamWorks’ Madagascar film series (and spin-offs), has seemingly done little to raise the nation’s profile.

Still, Venart is hopeful that the relentless dedication of conservationists will keep Madagascar’s wildlife from extinction and that new ways of telling Madagascar’s story – such as through Dykes’ great trek – will bring a larger global audience to the country.

“There is too much to lose, and no hurdle is too high,” said Venart. “There are a lot of really great conservation organisations and scientists on the ground in Madagascar working to protect its wildlife and help the local people. They need the support of the world.”

0,"Pepe Lucho, a rare Amazonian rodent kept as a pet, was recently defended by an enraged crowd that attacked law enforcement officials trying to confiscate the illegally held animal.

Similar events and public perceptions that fail to see wildlife trafficking as a serious crime have caused law enforcement to look the other way when encountering traffickers.

International wildlife smugglers have been emboldened by public acceptance of the domestic trade in threatened species, say wildlife advocates — doing very serious but largely undocumented harm to Peru’s wildlife.

Last October, a TV report from Peru’s Chanchamayo province depicted protesters swarming the streets, raising their voices in unison chanting: “Pepe Lucho is free! Pepe Lucho will not go!”

The angry dissenters brandished signs professing their disgust with Peru’s National Forest and Wildlife Service (SERFOR). They even stormed the government agency’s local offices, forcing officials to bar doors and windows to protect their own safety and avoid confronting the raging crowd.

Pepe Lucho, at the heart of so much resentment and controversy, is not a local political figure, celebrated soccer player or even a cherished kinsman. In fact, he is not human, but an over-sized rodent called a pacarana (Dinomys branickii) – a rare animal occurring only in the tropical forests of the western Amazon River basin that was being kept as a pet and tourist attraction.

So why do all those people care so deeply?

The answer lies in the many conflicting beliefs held by the Peruvian public concerning wildlife trafficking laws — with some perspectives born out of monetary gain, others from a love of wild animals long kept as pets, and a “don’t-tread-on-me” libertarian sense of entitlement regarding the nation’s wildlife.

Many conservationists argue that these longstanding public attitudes toward domestic wildlife trafficking intimidate and inhibit law enforcement, thus unintentionally protecting international traffickers who are looting Peru’s wildlife treasure trove. The indifference and corruption of law enforcement are also major factors for inaction.

TRAFFIC — a nonprofit organization that has monitored government responses to wildlife trafficking across the globe since 1976 — has circumstantial evidence to back these assertions. In a compendium of cases with prominent government interventions, TRAFFIC reports only 12 instances in the last 18 years in which any government police force intervened in wildlife trafficking cases involving Peru, at either origin or destination of goods. Of the six cases in which arrests were made, governments other than Peru were responsible for all but one. The remaining four local Peruvian cases not only had no clear arrests, but they also include one case in which a national police aircraft was used to traffic mahogany.

In contrast, a single trafficking study found that an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 wild-caught parrots alone are sold illegally in Peru’s domestic market each year, with detection rates as low as 2.5 and 3 percent for markets in regional capitals. Statistics are scant for mammals, reptiles, tropical fish and other species, though animals are openly traded in many local Peruvian marketplaces.

Outraged pet owners inadvertently aiding wildlife traffickers?

Sam and Noga Shanee, co-founders of Neotropical Primate Conservation, a United Kingdom nonprofit that works in the Amazonas and San Martin regions of Peru, first came to the country in search of the elusive Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda).

It took them almost no time to realize that wildlife trafficking posed a serious threat to wild populations of the primates in the region. So they set up Denuncia Fauna, a campaign that allows people to submit complaints about wildlife trafficking via email, with the assurance of anonymity.

In October 2014, Noga Shanee made an official complaint to authorities in Chanchamayo province, based on an email allegation she received that Pepe Lucho was being abused — despite being a nocturnal rodent, said the complainant, he was made to sit on a chair while tourists snapped pictures for a fee, and encouraged by his owner to feed the animal chocolate and other inappropriate foods.

In a 17 minute in-depth news report by Stephany Bravo of Modo Cine, featured on the news program Al Sexto Día, viewers can watch images of Pepe Lucho wearing sunglasses, sipping drinks, eating ice cream, and being petted by crowds of people, including the reporter herself.

“The officers came because [environmental officials] received a complaint from a female foreigner about how the cages were too small and about his food,” complained Pepe Lucho’s owner Señor Walter in the news report. Walter goes on to tell Bravo that pacaranas eat cacao seeds naturally in the wild, so justifying the feeding of chocolate to Pepe Lucho. He denies accusations of giving Pepe Lucho alcohol, and contends that the small cages are for Pepe’s protection, not his enslavement.

While Bravo’s report largely makes light of Pepe Lucho’s captivity, one fact is clear: the holding of wildlife in captivity without a permit is illegal in Peru. The country is a signatory of CITES, or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, which forbids wildlife trade for many rare and endangered species without explicit permits and attention to exportation quotas. The Pacarana is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

The force of law did not however give authorities the power needed to confiscate Pepe Lucho. At best, they were able to remove a few of his young progeny to a zoo in Lima, while being doggedly obstructed by the efforts and ire of the people of Chanchamayo.

Noga Shanee told mongabay.com that in addition to failing to confiscate Pepe Lucho, government officials also mishandled her anonymous trafficking report, allowing someone to make copies of her complaint — complete with name, address, phone number and email — and distribute the information to angry protesters. (Denuncia Fauna continues to protect the anonymity of the original complainant).

“For two weeks I received dozens of threatening calls, including some death threats, for several hours a day from different people,” Shanee revealed. These included a warning that she would be made into ceviche, Peru’s iconic dish of marinated cubes of raw fish, if she dared try to separate Pepe Lucho from the town.

“Only the great distance between Junín, and where I live in the Amazon region, is why people have not actually followed up on their threats,” Shanee asserted. “This is why people are afraid to approach environmental authorities and report cases of environmental crimes.”

The Al Sexto Día news program subsequently tracked down Pepe Lucho’s confiscated rodent progeny at the Huachipa Zoo in Lima, and confirmed that the animals could never be returned to the wild. A biologist told reporter Bravo that the overly domesticated young rodents would spend the rest of their lives well fed and cared for, but in a cage.

The seizure of the young rodents further inflamed tensions in Chanchamayo, serving as a catalyst for declarations of enduring affection for nuestro or “our” Pepe Lucho.

Conspicuously absent from news reports was any discussion over the need for the Peruvian public to obey the Peruvian Forestry and Wildlife Law which forbids domestic and international trafficking. In Pepe Lucho’s case, the people effectively silenced and thwarted law enforcement.

Public aggression regarding wildlife trafficking complaints has so intimidated police that they often now ask Shanee to put her name on denuncias, the complaints that the authorities themselves receive.

“For every animal that is kept as a pet, ten more have to die for it to come to a home,” said Shanee bluntly of the trade. She is appalled by what she sees as the authorities’ lax attitude in the face of hostile public opinion. “Even if the animal cannot be rehabilitated to the wild, I would still bring it to a rehabilitation center every single time until the message gets through — wild animals must not be kept as pets.”

The realities of wildlife trafficking in Peru

The federal government does not conduct comprehensive monitoring of wildlife trafficking in Peru, but individual researchers have reported on it for specific taxa and locations. The Shanees, for example recorded 722 encounters with 2,643 animals in the Amazonas and San Martin regions of Peru between 2007 and 2011, as documented in their paper in the Journal Endangered Species Research in 2012.

Of these encounters, 12 percent (315 animals) were categorized as Threatened by the IUCN, including 41 animals that were Critically Endangered. These included 18 San Martin titi monkeys (Callicebus oenanthe) and 23 yellow-tailed woolly monkeys (Oreonax flavicauda), both existing nowhere else in the world but Peru.

The Denuncia Fauna campaign received 74 complaints between April 2014 and January 2015, involving hundreds of cases across Peru, of wild animals being kept in private homes, recreational centers, and elsewhere. Most of these animals were categorized as Endangered and protected by Peruvian and international law. Cases included Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), night monkeys (Aotus miconax), and even pumas (Puma concolor).

Only rarely have raids revealed large organized trafficking of wildlife. In January 2015, police in Amazonas stopped a car containing more than 650 pihuichos or parakeets, while another vehicle got away with an estimated 450 tropical birds.

“They were sprayed with water, since these birds are quiet when it rains in the wild. They could not be released right away because their wings had been clipped,” revealed Shanee, who arranged for their transfer to Rescue Center Chuyachaqui, after the authorities requested Neotropical Primate Conservation’s help in rescuing the birds — an increasingly common occurrence.

In fact, this reporter’s interview with the Shanees was interrupted when Sam Shanee received a call to go and collect a red-tailed boa constrictor confiscated by the authorities and requiring his handling expertise. No one knows how many large-scale illegal international wildlife trafficking operations are at work in Peru.

“There is a lack of education on [wildlife trafficking] so many [people] do not see any wrong in having a wild animal as a pet,” Olivia Conrads told mongabay.com. “I think many think that if they are sold so freely in the market, it must be legal. There is a lack of control so traffickers can take the little risk involved.” Conrads runs Esperanza Verde, a wildlife rescue center in the Department of Ucayali in eastern Peru. She agrees that public naiveté may benefit criminal traffickers who, in many cases work openly, in defiance of the law.

“The traffickers are becoming smarter. Instead of trying to move large numbers of monkeys, we think they recruit women and children to transport them [falsely] as pets,” said Shanee. If these wildlife-mules are stopped, which is rare, they claim amidst tears that they rescued the animals and raised them by hand as beloved family pets.” Given the current climate of public opinion in Peru, police hesitate to make arrests, or even part the “pets” from their alleged owners.

Inés Nole, a Peruvian wildlife veterinarian with extensive experience working in wildlife rehabilitation centers, agrees with Shanee that authorities are unlikely to intervene in such cases. “Normally if a cop sees someone with a wild animal, I think they will not do anything about it. Rarely can you see police impound an animal unless they are from the ATFFS [Forestry and Wildlife Management],” said Nole. “What’s more, I would never think that a policeman would even say something if they see a woman or a child with a wild animal. Every time I’ve wanted to ask for help from the police to confiscate an animal, they tell me they cannot do that; I think even if they could, they do not care or do not know that [keeping] the animal [in captivity] is illegal.”

A failure to act to protect wildlife

Peru has a long history of hunting, trapping, selling, owning, and utilizing wild animals, typically treating them as a natural resource — an attitude commonly found across many societies. In the 1960s and ‘70s, Peru served as one of the largest wildlife exporters in Latin America. Large-scale trapping programs provided animals for biomedical research in the United States, and excess animals were sold in local markets. This ongoing trade may have fostered a false confidence and complacency regarding the inexhaustible supply of wild animals found in Peruvian forests.

Conrads offers another explanation for the fondness for wildlife as pets. “People just like to have something special, and a young monkey or ocelot just seems so nice,” she said. “People often do not think long-term; even with normal pets, like dogs and cats. This is still a problem. It is too easy to exchange them. If one dies, just take another.”

Nole believes that the practice could also have originated from the large migration of people from the rainforests to the coastal cities. “For most people from the jungle it has always been just normal to hunt animals for food, including monkeys, and if the animal was a breeding female, her infant was used as a pet,” said Nole.

Nole, Conrads and Shanee all agree that domestic trafficking practices have gone unpunished for so long, that most Peruvian people now view wildlife in the pet trade as something quite natural — and legal.

Meanwhile, modern hunting practices, which feed the wildlife trade, are also likely having a strong impact on forest populations, even changing the forest landscape. A 2008 study of contiguous forests in southeastern Peru, in which primates had been hunted with firearms for 30 to 40 years, revealed a predictable loss of large-bodied primates, accompanied by a surprising subsequent 46 percent decrease in seedlings of primate-dispersed trees. “This opens the possibility of shifts in tree species composition, even in hunted forests that are not logged or fragmented, towards forests dominated by trees dispersed by wind or non-game animals,” note the authors. The loss of other mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds to trafficking may be having similar impacts on forests, but such research is currently lacking.

Yet, there continues to be a pronounced resistance on the part of the Peruvian government to crack down on crimes involving wildlife, which is particularly disconcerting in view of the extent of the trade.

In the city of Lima alone, officials confiscated 17,932 live animals and 81,564 animal products between 2000 to 2007. Nearly half of the live animals they found were birds, primarily of the family Psittacidae, which contains 150 species of parrots within 32 different genera. Amphibians and reptiles represented most of the other half, and a small number (5.6 percent) were mammals. More recently, 13,033 live animals belonging to 51 species were confiscated across the nation between 2009 and 2012.

These appears to be large numbers until you again consider that an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 wild-caught parrots alone are sold illegally in Peru’s domestic market annually according to one study, with detection rates as low as 2.5 percent for markets in regional capitals.

“The transport police have the authority to confiscate animals, but usually don’t look for wildlife. And often animals confiscated by police are later sold, or traffickers are allowed to pass after paying a bribe,” Shanee asserted. Indeed, arrests for trafficking are staggeringly infrequent, compared to estimates of the widespread nature of the trade.

Moreover, punishments for wildlife trafficking in Peru are minor compared to other nations. For example, an aquarium firm caught illegally exporting over 1,000 reptiles and amphibians from Peru in 1997, paid a fine of just $5,400. By comparison, Tim Eaton of Florida, president of a Peruvian export company, spent two years in jail and paid $25,000 in fines when convicted in the U.S. in 1993 for smuggling 144 snakes, including anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and red-railed boa constrictors (Boa constrictor ortonii) into the U.S. from Peru.

The International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) recently used Peru as a test case for its wildlife and forest crime analytic toolkit, an exhaustive inspection of trafficking of natural resources.

“The impunity with which crimes are committed, particularly trade in species of flora and fauna, is evident. Markets operate in full view of the authorities, which rarely seize or confiscate goods,” states the report. “The efforts of the authorities have barely any effect, owing mainly to limited resources and logistics.”

Even if enforcement authorities do respond to a trafficking complaint, said Shanee, “they are ineffective because they do not have the right cages to transport animals, and they are often outnumbered by the crowd.”

As with the case of Pepe Lucho, this can result in a standoff between law enforcement and the public. When SERFOR officials received reports of a spectacled bear dying of pneumonia, and of allegations of illegal zoos, they tried to confiscate two Near Threatened Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), two Vulnerable spectacled bears (Tremarctos ornatus), and a Near Threatened Sechuran fox (Lycalopex sechurae ), among other animals from captivity in Sandia in the Cuyo Cuyo district. However, members of the general public interceded and resisted.

Five officials, reports say, anesthetized the birds, and were then accosted by “peasant patrols” that allegedly kidnapped the officers. The peasant patrolmen reportedly beat the SERFOR men in public in the main plaza, and accused them of being robbers and not providing signed documents, a charge SERFOR denies. Fearing for their lives and the safety of the animals, SERFOR returned all the animals to the “zoo” where they had been held captive.

The ICCWC recommends a complete overhaul of protocols for detecting and prosecuting wildlife crimes in Peru.

Perceptions of wildlife trafficking in Peru

In the face of governmental failures, it is increasingly NGOs who take on the role of curbing the illegal wildlife trade. A recent analysis of 28 NGOs concerned with conservation and/or animal-welfare, reveals the perceptions of activists, on whom so much responsibility now falls. Interviewed NGO representatives identified government prioritization of timber crimes as being more important than wildlife trafficking crimes — along with government corruption — as the two major impediments to trafficking law enforcement.

“The Dirección General Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (DGFFS), you know the nickname don’t you?” asked one NGO interviewee in the study. “It’s the Dirección General de Falcificación, Fraude y Soborno [General Directorate of Falsification, Fraud and Bribery]. And, I mean it’s true. It has to be the most corrupt place in Peru.”

“We are a megadiverse country,” said another interviewee, “and all of our biodiversity is passing through the markets.”

With proposed government trafficking regulations that will enforce Peru’s Forestry and Wildlife Law (29763) now very near approval, Shanee worries that the rules may do more harm than good. She suspects that, in order to cut down on illegal trafficking, Peru will simply increase its options for the legal extraction of wildlife from its forests — flooding the market with legal wildlife, and likely increasing peoples’ affection for wild animals as pets.

Countries like Peru “don’t invest in investigation or offer creative solutions to wildlife trafficking, but they enthusiastically adopt philosophies [for] privatizing nature and let market forces control the future of wildlife, hoping things will get better by themselves,” Shanee writes in a report she titled Lazy Conservation. “The problem with this logic is that… the sacrifice of animals legally exploited is added to the ones illegally hunted or traded, and permits are often used to launder illegal trade.”

If trafficking continues to be tolerated by the public, benefiting an out of control illegal trade, Shanee and other conservationists worry that many of the nation’s remaining wild animals could suffer Pepe Lucho’s fate — until one day, the only place to find wildlife in Peru will be in a cage.

Similar events and public perceptions that fail to see wildlife trafficking as a serious crime have caused law enforcement to look the other way when encountering traffickers.

International wildlife smugglers have been emboldened by public acceptance of the domestic trade in threatened species, say wildlife advocates — doing very serious but largely undocumented harm to Peru’s wildlife.

Last October, a TV report from Peru’s Chanchamayo province depicted protesters swarming the streets, raising their voices in unison chanting: “Pepe Lucho is free! Pepe Lucho will not go!”

The angry dissenters brandished signs professing their disgust with Peru’s National Forest and Wildlife Service (SERFOR). They even stormed the government agency’s local offices, forcing officials to bar doors and windows to protect their own safety and avoid confronting the raging crowd.

Pepe Lucho, at the heart of so much resentment and controversy, is not a local political figure, celebrated soccer player or even a cherished kinsman. In fact, he is not human, but an over-sized rodent called a pacarana (Dinomys branickii) – a rare animal occurring only in the tropical forests of the western Amazon River basin that was being kept as a pet and tourist attraction.

So why do all those people care so deeply?

The answer lies in the many conflicting beliefs held by the Peruvian public concerning wildlife trafficking laws — with some perspectives born out of monetary gain, others from a love of wild animals long kept as pets, and a “don’t-tread-on-me” libertarian sense of entitlement regarding the nation’s wildlife.

Many conservationists argue that these longstanding public attitudes toward domestic wildlife trafficking intimidate and inhibit law enforcement, thus unintentionally protecting international traffickers who are looting Peru’s wildlife treasure trove. The indifference and corruption of law enforcement are also major factors for inaction.

TRAFFIC — a nonprofit organization that has monitored government responses to wildlife trafficking across the globe since 1976 — has circumstantial evidence to back these assertions. In a compendium of cases with prominent government interventions, TRAFFIC reports only 12 instances in the last 18 years in which any government police force intervened in wildlife trafficking cases involving Peru, at either origin or destination of goods. Of the six cases in which arrests were made, governments other than Peru were responsible for all but one. The remaining four local Peruvian cases not only had no clear arrests, but they also include one case in which a national police aircraft was used to traffic mahogany.

In contrast, a single trafficking study found that an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 wild-caught parrots alone are sold illegally in Peru’s domestic market each year, with detection rates as low as 2.5 and 3 percent for markets in regional capitals. Statistics are scant for mammals, reptiles, tropical fish and other species, though animals are openly traded in many local Peruvian marketplaces.

Outraged pet owners inadvertently aiding wildlife traffickers?

Sam and Noga Shanee, co-founders of Neotropical Primate Conservation, a United Kingdom nonprofit that works in the Amazonas and San Martin regions of Peru, first came to the country in search of the elusive Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda).

It took them almost no time to realize that wildlife trafficking posed a serious threat to wild populations of the primates in the region. So they set up Denuncia Fauna, a campaign that allows people to submit complaints about wildlife trafficking via email, with the assurance of anonymity.

In October 2014, Noga Shanee made an official complaint to authorities in Chanchamayo province, based on an email allegation she received that Pepe Lucho was being abused — despite being a nocturnal rodent, said the complainant, he was made to sit on a chair while tourists snapped pictures for a fee, and encouraged by his owner to feed the animal chocolate and other inappropriate foods.

In a 17 minute in-depth news report by Stephany Bravo of Modo Cine, featured on the news program Al Sexto Día, viewers can watch images of Pepe Lucho wearing sunglasses, sipping drinks, eating ice cream, and being petted by crowds of people, including the reporter herself.

“The officers came because [environmental officials] received a complaint from a female foreigner about how the cages were too small and about his food,” complained Pepe Lucho’s owner Señor Walter in the news report. Walter goes on to tell Bravo that pacaranas eat cacao seeds naturally in the wild, so justifying the feeding of chocolate to Pepe Lucho. He denies accusations of giving Pepe Lucho alcohol, and contends that the small cages are for Pepe’s protection, not his enslavement.

While Bravo’s report largely makes light of Pepe Lucho’s captivity, one fact is clear: the holding of wildlife in captivity without a permit is illegal in Peru. The country is a signatory of CITES, or the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna, which forbids wildlife trade for many rare and endangered species without explicit permits and attention to exportation quotas. The Pacarana is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

The force of law did not however give authorities the power needed to confiscate Pepe Lucho. At best, they were able to remove a few of his young progeny to a zoo in Lima, while being doggedly obstructed by the efforts and ire of the people of Chanchamayo.

Noga Shanee told mongabay.com that in addition to failing to confiscate Pepe Lucho, government officials also mishandled her anonymous trafficking report, allowing someone to make copies of her complaint — complete with name, address, phone number and email — and distribute the information to angry protesters. (Denuncia Fauna continues to protect the anonymity of the original complainant).

“For two weeks I received dozens of threatening calls, including some death threats, for several hours a day from different people,” Shanee revealed. These included a warning that she would be made into ceviche, Peru’s iconic dish of marinated cubes of raw fish, if she dared try to separate Pepe Lucho from the town.

“Only the great distance between Junín, and where I live in the Amazon region, is why people have not actually followed up on their threats,” Shanee asserted. “This is why people are afraid to approach environmental authorities and report cases of environmental crimes.”

The Al Sexto Día news program subsequently tracked down Pepe Lucho’s confiscated rodent progeny at the Huachipa Zoo in Lima, and confirmed that the animals could never be returned to the wild. A biologist told reporter Bravo that the overly domesticated young rodents would spend the rest of their lives well fed and cared for, but in a cage.

The seizure of the young rodents further inflamed tensions in Chanchamayo, serving as a catalyst for declarations of enduring affection for nuestro or “our” Pepe Lucho.

Conspicuously absent from news reports was any discussion over the need for the Peruvian public to obey the Peruvian Forestry and Wildlife Law which forbids domestic and international trafficking. In Pepe Lucho’s case, the people effectively silenced and thwarted law enforcement.

Public aggression regarding wildlife trafficking complaints has so intimidated police that they often now ask Shanee to put her name on denuncias, the complaints that the authorities themselves receive.

“For every animal that is kept as a pet, ten more have to die for it to come to a home,” said Shanee bluntly of the trade. She is appalled by what she sees as the authorities’ lax attitude in the face of hostile public opinion. “Even if the animal cannot be rehabilitated to the wild, I would still bring it to a rehabilitation center every single time until the message gets through — wild animals must not be kept as pets.”

The realities of wildlife trafficking in Peru

The federal government does not conduct comprehensive monitoring of wildlife trafficking in Peru, but individual researchers have reported on it for specific taxa and locations. The Shanees, for example recorded 722 encounters with 2,643 animals in the Amazonas and San Martin regions of Peru between 2007 and 2011, as documented in their paper in the Journal Endangered Species Research in 2012.

Of these encounters, 12 percent (315 animals) were categorized as Threatened by the IUCN, including 41 animals that were Critically Endangered. These included 18 San Martin titi monkeys (Callicebus oenanthe) and 23 yellow-tailed woolly monkeys (Oreonax flavicauda), both existing nowhere else in the world but Peru.

The Denuncia Fauna campaign received 74 complaints between April 2014 and January 2015, involving hundreds of cases across Peru, of wild animals being kept in private homes, recreational centers, and elsewhere. Most of these animals were categorized as Endangered and protected by Peruvian and international law. Cases included Humboldt penguins (Spheniscus humboldti), night monkeys (Aotus miconax), and even pumas (Puma concolor).

Only rarely have raids revealed large organized trafficking of wildlife. In January 2015, police in Amazonas stopped a car containing more than 650 pihuichos or parakeets, while another vehicle got away with an estimated 450 tropical birds.

“They were sprayed with water, since these birds are quiet when it rains in the wild. They could not be released right away because their wings had been clipped,” revealed Shanee, who arranged for their transfer to Rescue Center Chuyachaqui, after the authorities requested Neotropical Primate Conservation’s help in rescuing the birds — an increasingly common occurrence.

In fact, this reporter’s interview with the Shanees was interrupted when Sam Shanee received a call to go and collect a red-tailed boa constrictor confiscated by the authorities and requiring his handling expertise. No one knows how many large-scale illegal international wildlife trafficking operations are at work in Peru.

“There is a lack of education on [wildlife trafficking] so many [people] do not see any wrong in having a wild animal as a pet,” Olivia Conrads told mongabay.com. “I think many think that if they are sold so freely in the market, it must be legal. There is a lack of control so traffickers can take the little risk involved.” Conrads runs Esperanza Verde, a wildlife rescue center in the Department of Ucayali in eastern Peru. She agrees that public naiveté may benefit criminal traffickers who, in many cases work openly, in defiance of the law.

“The traffickers are becoming smarter. Instead of trying to move large numbers of monkeys, we think they recruit women and children to transport them [falsely] as pets,” said Shanee. If these wildlife-mules are stopped, which is rare, they claim amidst tears that they rescued the animals and raised them by hand as beloved family pets.” Given the current climate of public opinion in Peru, police hesitate to make arrests, or even part the “pets” from their alleged owners.

Inés Nole, a Peruvian wildlife veterinarian with extensive experience working in wildlife rehabilitation centers, agrees with Shanee that authorities are unlikely to intervene in such cases. “Normally if a cop sees someone with a wild animal, I think they will not do anything about it. Rarely can you see police impound an animal unless they are from the ATFFS [Forestry and Wildlife Management],” said Nole. “What’s more, I would never think that a policeman would even say something if they see a woman or a child with a wild animal. Every time I’ve wanted to ask for help from the police to confiscate an animal, they tell me they cannot do that; I think even if they could, they do not care or do not know that [keeping] the animal [in captivity] is illegal.”

A failure to act to protect wildlife

Peru has a long history of hunting, trapping, selling, owning, and utilizing wild animals, typically treating them as a natural resource — an attitude commonly found across many societies. In the 1960s and ‘70s, Peru served as one of the largest wildlife exporters in Latin America. Large-scale trapping programs provided animals for biomedical research in the United States, and excess animals were sold in local markets. This ongoing trade may have fostered a false confidence and complacency regarding the inexhaustible supply of wild animals found in Peruvian forests.

Conrads offers another explanation for the fondness for wildlife as pets. “People just like to have something special, and a young monkey or ocelot just seems so nice,” she said. “People often do not think long-term; even with normal pets, like dogs and cats. This is still a problem. It is too easy to exchange them. If one dies, just take another.”

Nole believes that the practice could also have originated from the large migration of people from the rainforests to the coastal cities. “For most people from the jungle it has always been just normal to hunt animals for food, including monkeys, and if the animal was a breeding female, her infant was used as a pet,” said Nole.

Nole, Conrads and Shanee all agree that domestic trafficking practices have gone unpunished for so long, that most Peruvian people now view wildlife in the pet trade as something quite natural — and legal.

Meanwhile, modern hunting practices, which feed the wildlife trade, are also likely having a strong impact on forest populations, even changing the forest landscape. A 2008 study of contiguous forests in southeastern Peru, in which primates had been hunted with firearms for 30 to 40 years, revealed a predictable loss of large-bodied primates, accompanied by a surprising subsequent 46 percent decrease in seedlings of primate-dispersed trees. “This opens the possibility of shifts in tree species composition, even in hunted forests that are not logged or fragmented, towards forests dominated by trees dispersed by wind or non-game animals,” note the authors. The loss of other mammals, reptiles, amphibians and birds to trafficking may be having similar impacts on forests, but such research is currently lacking.

Yet, there continues to be a pronounced resistance on the part of the Peruvian government to crack down on crimes involving wildlife, which is particularly disconcerting in view of the extent of the trade.

In the city of Lima alone, officials confiscated 17,932 live animals and 81,564 animal products between 2000 to 2007. Nearly half of the live animals they found were birds, primarily of the family Psittacidae, which contains 150 species of parrots within 32 different genera. Amphibians and reptiles represented most of the other half, and a small number (5.6 percent) were mammals. More recently, 13,033 live animals belonging to 51 species were confiscated across the nation between 2009 and 2012.

These appears to be large numbers until you again consider that an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 wild-caught parrots alone are sold illegally in Peru’s domestic market annually according to one study, with detection rates as low as 2.5 percent for markets in regional capitals.

“The transport police have the authority to confiscate animals, but usually don’t look for wildlife. And often animals confiscated by police are later sold, or traffickers are allowed to pass after paying a bribe,” Shanee asserted. Indeed, arrests for trafficking are staggeringly infrequent, compared to estimates of the widespread nature of the trade.

Moreover, punishments for wildlife trafficking in Peru are minor compared to other nations. For example, an aquarium firm caught illegally exporting over 1,000 reptiles and amphibians from Peru in 1997, paid a fine of just $5,400. By comparison, Tim Eaton of Florida, president of a Peruvian export company, spent two years in jail and paid $25,000 in fines when convicted in the U.S. in 1993 for smuggling 144 snakes, including anacondas (Eunectes murinus) and red-railed boa constrictors (Boa constrictor ortonii) into the U.S. from Peru.

The International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime (ICCWC) of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) recently used Peru as a test case for its wildlife and forest crime analytic toolkit, an exhaustive inspection of trafficking of natural resources.

“The impunity with which crimes are committed, particularly trade in species of flora and fauna, is evident. Markets operate in full view of the authorities, which rarely seize or confiscate goods,” states the report. “The efforts of the authorities have barely any effect, owing mainly to limited resources and logistics.”

Even if enforcement authorities do respond to a trafficking complaint, said Shanee, “they are ineffective because they do not have the right cages to transport animals, and they are often outnumbered by the crowd.”

As with the case of Pepe Lucho, this can result in a standoff between law enforcement and the public. When SERFOR officials received reports of a spectacled bear dying of pneumonia, and of allegations of illegal zoos, they tried to confiscate two Near Threatened Andean condors (Vultur gryphus), two Vulnerable spectacled bears (Tremarctos ornatus), and a Near Threatened Sechuran fox (Lycalopex sechurae ), among other animals from captivity in Sandia in the Cuyo Cuyo district. However, members of the general public interceded and resisted.

Five officials, reports say, anesthetized the birds, and were then accosted by “peasant patrols” that allegedly kidnapped the officers. The peasant patrolmen reportedly beat the SERFOR men in public in the main plaza, and accused them of being robbers and not providing signed documents, a charge SERFOR denies. Fearing for their lives and the safety of the animals, SERFOR returned all the animals to the “zoo” where they had been held captive.

The ICCWC recommends a complete overhaul of protocols for detecting and prosecuting wildlife crimes in Peru.

Perceptions of wildlife trafficking in Peru

In the face of governmental failures, it is increasingly NGOs who take on the role of curbing the illegal wildlife trade. A recent analysis of 28 NGOs concerned with conservation and/or animal-welfare, reveals the perceptions of activists, on whom so much responsibility now falls. Interviewed NGO representatives identified government prioritization of timber crimes as being more important than wildlife trafficking crimes — along with government corruption — as the two major impediments to trafficking law enforcement.

“The Dirección General Forestal y de Fauna Silvestre (DGFFS), you know the nickname don’t you?” asked one NGO interviewee in the study. “It’s the Dirección General de Falcificación, Fraude y Soborno [General Directorate of Falsification, Fraud and Bribery]. And, I mean it’s true. It has to be the most corrupt place in Peru.”

“We are a megadiverse country,” said another interviewee, “and all of our biodiversity is passing through the markets.”

With proposed government trafficking regulations that will enforce Peru’s Forestry and Wildlife Law (29763) now very near approval, Shanee worries that the rules may do more harm than good. She suspects that, in order to cut down on illegal trafficking, Peru will simply increase its options for the legal extraction of wildlife from its forests — flooding the market with legal wildlife, and likely increasing peoples’ affection for wild animals as pets.

Countries like Peru “don’t invest in investigation or offer creative solutions to wildlife trafficking, but they enthusiastically adopt philosophies [for] privatizing nature and let market forces control the future of wildlife, hoping things will get better by themselves,” Shanee writes in a report she titled Lazy Conservation. “The problem with this logic is that… the sacrifice of animals legally exploited is added to the ones illegally hunted or traded, and permits are often used to launder illegal trade.”

If trafficking continues to be tolerated by the public, benefiting an out of control illegal trade, Shanee and other conservationists worry that many of the nation’s remaining wild animals could suffer Pepe Lucho’s fate — until one day, the only place to find wildlife in Peru will be in a cage.

After the viewer’s eyes adjust to the shadows of the glassed-in exhibit, the shy amphibians appear behind driftwood. They skitter into the light, an orange stripe running down a jacket of black, from head to tail, lined with splotches of orange and yellow.

This multicolored species is only one wildfire away from being extinct, experts say.

That’s the word on the San Antonio Zoo’s latest acquisition, the Kaiser’s spotted newt, one of several species of salamanders featured at the amphibian TOADally exhibit. Craig Pelke, director of ectotherms, said the Detroit Zoo donated 17 newts from its breeding program; 12 are on display, and five live behind the scenes. They can be seen during regular zoo hours, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., year-round.

“They happen to be a personal favorite of mine,” Pelke said. “Each one has its own distinctive pattern, like a fingerprint.”

Elizabeth Castillo, marketing coordinator, said the exhibit is a good opportunity for visitors to view creatures that aren’t always in the limelight.

“A lot of times people come to the zoo looking for flashy animals like lions and tigers,” Castillo said. “But I think it’s nice for people to enjoy the smaller animals, because even the smaller animals have a big impact on our environment and world.”

The species is also known as the emperor spotted newt, Luristan newt and Iranian newt. It joins a diverse group of amphibians including blue-tailed fire-bellied newts and a European fire salamander. Pelke said the highlight of the amphibian exhibit is the Japanese giant salamander, the second-largest species in the world. It can grow up to 4 feet long, big enough for a child to ride.

The Kaiser’s spotted newt is found in a 10-square-kilometer area of west central Iran. They live in humid, damp woodlands along four tributary rivers. They only reproduce in pools and rivers, and they eat black worms, fruit flies and crickets.

Pelke said during a 10-year span, from 2000 to 2010, the species declined 80 percent because of over-collection from the pet trade, habitat destruction and invasive species, such as carp, that prey on the newt’s larvae. According to conservation reports, fewer than 1,000 of the critically endangered newts are thought to be left in the wild.

The San Antonio Zoo plans to follow the Detroit Zoo’s example and help propagate the species.

“We share the wealth,” he said. “Our plans are to get them to reproduce so we can be a contributor as well.”

0,"Indonesia’s Sulawesi is home to the maleo, a bird with highly unusual reproductive behaviors, and threatened for decades with extinction.

Loss of nesting sites and harvesting of the maleo’s huge, nutritious eggs has drastically reduced their numbers, which at last count came to just 4,000-7,000 breeding pairs.

A unique partnership between conservationists, birders, local villagers and farmers — done for remarkably little money — has begun to reverse the maleo’s fortunes, with more than 10,000 chicks hatched and released over the last 15 years.

Conservation success stories are rare. Too often we read of the losing battles: local extinctions and irreversible biodiversity losses, often at the expense of shortsighted exploitation-for-profit schemes. Refreshingly, the plight of the maleo is different. This story is one of conservation success.

Maleos are, by all accounts, weird birds. They are chicken-like creatures with duotone plumage; a minimalist contrast of coal-black above and soft, peach-pink below. The bare, multi-colored skin of their heads — somewhat reminiscent of a vulture — is capped by a strange, bulbous protrusion called a casque. This adornment has affectionately been described as a football helmet or a walnut, or less affectionately as an engorged tick.

Maleos are megapodes — mound-builders — members of a 26-species family of ground-dwelling birds peppered across the islands of Australasia, many endemic to their respective landmasses.

The megapode we are concerned with here is Macrocephalon maleo, found only on Sulawesi; the fourth-largest island in Indonesia and the eleventh-largest island in the world. Sulawesi, just east of Borneo, is a collection of peninsulas: four spokes of sand and inland forest attached to a hub of tall, imposing mountains.

Indonesia has the dubious honor of hosting more species threatened with extinction than any other country on Earth, and the maleo is among them. It went from Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List in 2000 to Endangered in 2002, and has stayed there since. IUCN’s most recent estimates put the total existing population at 4,000-7,000 breeding pairs (12,000-21,000 individuals).

Recently however, their story began to take a considerably more hopeful turn — and a lot of that shift has to do with this bird’s bizarre breeding behaviors and people’s fascination with it.

Digging the maleo’s reproductive cycle

Maleos are swift, plump birds built on stout legs that help them weave through the forest understory. But running isn’t the only thing for which maleos use their powerful legs.

Unlike many other birds, megapodes such as the maleo don’t incubate their nests using body heat; rather they let nature do the work. As their name suggests, most mound-builders scrape together enormous piles on the forest floor; a layer of decomposing vegetation on bottom, with a layer of soil or sand on top, and eggs sandwiched in between. The chemical process of vegetative decay below releases heat which is then trapped by the blanketing layer of earth, resulting in incubation.

Whereas some megapode species dutifully attend their mounds — adding or removing content to maintain the proper temperature within — maleos evolved using a different strategy.

Maleos on Sulawesi tap the natural resources of the island, relying on heat from thermal vents or sun-warmed sand to incubate their eggs. And instead of building up like other megapodes, maleos dig down. A maleo pair works together to excavate a hole at a communal nesting area, sometimes surrounded by other maleos doing the same thing. This is a scene that can quickly devolve into bedlam as more maleo pairs join the fray; a fury of kicking sand and clucking birds. A visit to a maleo nest site can be like attending a dozen weddings at once, with everyone throwing rice at each other, everyone shouting, and prowling bachelors looking for trouble.

Despite the chaos, maleo digging is not haphazard and egg placement is not random. As the birds excavate furiously — one of the pair digs while the other watches for predators or interloping maleos — they also gauge the substrate temperature. The birds regularly sample sand or earth with their mouths as they dig, thus “tasting” the temperature as they go. When they find a pocket of 33ᵒC (91ᵒF) soil, give or take a degree, they stop. This is the maleo sweet spot. The female then lays a single, massive egg, which she carefully places upright in the hole, then covers.

This egg, five times larger than a chicken egg and containing twice as much yolk, is the largest laid by any megapode. When the young bird hatches it’s going to need all that protein, because once buried the adult pair leaves the egg and hopes for the best. Parental duties complete — for that chick. Over a two or three month period the pair does return to the same nest site and repeats the reproductive process up to a dozen times: digging, laying, covering, walking away.

Taking a running start at life

When a maleo chick hatches after 60-90 days of incubation, it hits the ground running. Literally.

The first thing the chick must do is burrow to the surface, sometimes through a meter of soil or sand, a harrowing task that can take up to two days. Next, the maleo instinctively makes a break for the forest; running and even flying.

“Watching a maleo chick come out of the ground and fly away is a remarkable sight,” says Iwan Hunowu, a maleo conservationist for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Indonesia Program (WCS Indonesia). In fact, this astonishing behavior at such a young age makes maleos among the most physically-mature vertebrate newborns on the planet.

One of Mr. Hunowu’s colleagues, Matt Leggett, notes that a freshly-hatched maleo is surprisingly tenacious: “The first chick I saw hatch took to the air but landed in a river, where it swam 10 meters [33 feet] through sizable rapids, climbed up the opposite bank, then flew off again.” Not bad for a two-day-old.

The maleo’s unique life cycle — particularly its utter reliance on conspicuous and exposed communal nest sites — has made the species vulnerable to human threats. Sulawesi villagers have a long history of harvesting, then selling the protein-laden eggs. In addition to human nest site poachers, there is the problem of vanishing habitat; the distance between coastal nest sites and the forests where the birds live continues to widen.

Farmers, with few economic alternatives, clear away the Sulawesi forests for agriculture, while cash-strapped local governments open them for logging. At some point, maleos regard the expanding gap between nest and forest as unacceptable, perhaps understanding that a two-day-old bird cannot cross the gauntlet of that ever-widening barrier, and another historical nest site is abandoned.

Saving Sulawesi’s maleos

The first efforts to protect maleos began in the 1980s and took on added urgency in the early 2000s, when a survey reported abandonment of more than half the known nest sites in northern Sulawesi. Across the island as a whole, 48 of the 142 known nesting grounds had been abandoned by 2002, another 51 were severely threatened, and 32 were threatened.

In 2001, WCS Indonesia began protecting nest sites at Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park on the northern Minahasa Peninsula, and the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation helped initiate a ban on egg collecting in 2004 on the East Peninsula. In both locations, maleo protection programs developed in partnership with local interest groups and were underpinned by the idea that villagers living near nest sites have the most to gain by maleo conservation.

Former poachers and other villagers were hired to monitor maleo nest sites, thus swapping an illegal lifestyle for a sustainable one. In addition to deterring poaching, these monitors also assess population size by documenting the number of adult maleos that visit nest sites, and they transplant some eggs to a semi-natural, fenced-off section of ground where they are protected from predators.

While the egg guardians may have initially signed on due to the financial incentive — one can earn a better income protecting maleo eggs than stealing them — a number of villagers now rally around the maleo as a source of local pride.

However, conservation groups recognize that the guardian model, largely funded via a perpetual cycle of grant applications, awards, and reports, is not necessarily sustainable: pride cannot pay the bills. Conservationists worry that one day a major grant will fail to materialize and maleo protectors will go unpaid, perhaps causing desperate guardians to revert to poaching in order to provide for their families.

The bird watching bonanza

Luckily, maleos can offer something more to human communities. Sulawesi is thought to support a greater number of endemic birds than anywhere else in the world, with 41 species found nowhere else, and a staggering 12 endemic genera. This fact is especially significant for the throngs of affluent birdwatchers staring at 41 empty check boxes on their life lists.

Jon Riley, the Program Manager for WCS Indonesia at the inception of the maleo conservation program, notes that the maleo’s gaudy flair for the bizarre gives it broad appeal beyond birdwatchers: these are not the macaques (loved by tourists but despised by villagers for the crop damage they cause), or drab songbirds that vanish into the foliage and about which locals cannot understand why all the fuss is being made. Maleos, with their conspicuous pit-digging antics and track star two-day-old chicks, are celebrities for all.

Maleo-focused conservation groups have wisely tapped into this universal interest, and many of the protected nest sites now offer eco-tours to generate additional and more reliable income for local villages.

Visiting a maleo nest site, says Mr. Riley, is fascinating: “it’s a tactile species: you can see them, hear their unusual vocalizations, see their burrows, handle their eggs — and once an audience is hooked, guides can pivot the dialogue from ecology to conservation. [Guides] explain that maleos are endemic to Sulawesi and in need of our help.”

Maleos on the beach, and in the Big Apple

In 2008, and with support from WCS Indonesia, an NGO called Pelestari Alam Liar dan Satwa (PALS) took maleo conservation to a new level: they bought the beach. Specifically, a 22-hectare (54 acre) patch of sand and trees centered on a maleo nest site. In doing so they created the Binerean Nature Reserve. The former landowners, a collection of coconut farmers, were then hired to manage the park with PALS oversight. The farmers now harvest their coconuts in a “maleo-friendly” fashion.

This enterprise ideally balances the needs of people and maleos. It maintains pre-park levels of income for local landowners, provides funding for reserve management and protection, while at the same time guaranteeing disturbance-free nesting for maleos. It’s the difficult win-win scenario conservationists are continually seeking.

This success story led to additional PALS land purchases. Today nearly 150 hectares (370 acres) of maleo habitat is under sustainable maleo management. That includes a forest corridor between Binerean Nature Reserve and Sulawesi’s closest national park.

Still, maleo reproductive conditions aren’t perfect. Even with poacher and nest predator deterrents, maleo hatching success rates in the wild only hover around 50 percent. Conservationists, eager to increase those odds to help the species rebound, found help in an urban setting halfway around the globe: WCS’s Bronx Zoo in New York City. This zoo is now the only place on earth, outside of Sulawesi, where birders and other visitors can see maleos.

The zoo’s ornithological staff has, over time, painstakingly replicated natural breeding conditions there. Each of the two zoo-kept maleo pairs is furnished with a “pit room” boasting a meter-deep sandbox with pockets warmed to 33ᵒC (91ᵒF). Such fussy conditions are vital to reproduction: if the maleos can’t find the perfect temperature, they will dig but won’t lay eggs. Staff keep close tabs on breeding behavior and swoop in to remove an egg for artificial incubation the moment it is laid. But how do keepers know when laying is imminent?

“The critical moment is the ‘peanut test,’” laughed Alana O’Sullivan, a Senior Wild Animal Keeper in a recent conversation in the off-exhibit maleo breeding wing of the Bronx Zoo. Apparently, maleos will do anything within their power to acquire – then rapidly consume – a peanut. The moment this treat is offered and refused, the staff know a female is singularly focused on reproduction: she’ll lay sometime within the next 24 hours.

After six years of brow-furrowing trial and error, in which zoo staff tested the impact of varying factors such as substrate type, temperature, and relative humidity on egg development, the Bronx Zoo is now able to hatch maleo eggs with an impressive 91 percent success rate — almost twice as high as in the wild.

Eggs are carefully scooped out of the warm sandpits and positioned in a beaker of sterilized plastic beads with a strict temperature of 32.5ᵒC (90.5ᵒF), and a relative humidity of 89-90%. This maleo cookbook has been shared with incubators on Sulawesi nearly 10,000 miles away, thus improving hatch success in situ, and resulting in more maleo chicks fluttering resolutely toward the tree line.

Hope for Sulawesi’s maleo megapode

While there have been clear, quantifiable conservation successes both in the wild and in captivity, whether those efforts translate to improving maleo numbers is less obvious. True, more than 10,000 maleo chicks have been successfully hatched and released from WCS-managed sites alone over the past 15 years, but what happens to those birds post-release remains largely unknown. How many actually survive to breed themselves? No one can say.

One positive indication comes from “translocation” programs, where eggs from an active nest site are transferred to the sands of an abandoned nest site; some such chicks have grown to adulthood and returned to renew the breeding cycle at those once-silent beaches.

Another indication comes from the village of Libuun, where after a decade of egg protection and community involvement overseen by the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation, the number of adult maleos recorded at the nest site there has tripled.

However, for the momentum of maleo conservation to continue on a positive trajectory, the focus should remain on protecting and restoring nest sites and forest habitat, rather than encouraging more hatcheries and more chicks. Without maleo habitat for these chicks to return to the hatcheries themselves are useless.

As stunning as the maleo conservation success story is, the price for the species rescue is even more astounding. The job is being done on the cheap, and is comparatively inexpensive. Each fledged chick represents a mere $4 investment, with the combined WCS-managed sites on the Minahasa Peninsula operating on only about $40,000 annually. However, maleo conservationists lament that even that modest sum is raised with difficulty and they could really use more: $100,000 annually would be optimal to ensure site protection, build community outreach, and conduct research.

It’s easy to lose hope under the barrage of negative wildlife news; the never-ending Twitter feeds regarding severed rhino horns or suitcases bursting with pangolin scales. But thanks to a motley team of conservationists, former egg poachers, coconut farmers, international birders, and Bronx zookeepers, there’s hope for the maleo yet. And that, my friends, is a conservation success story worth savoring and celebrating.

This egg, five times larger than a chicken egg and containing twice as much yolk, is the largest laid by any megapode. When the young bird hatches it’s going to need all that protein, because once buried the adult pair leaves the egg and hopes for the best. Parental duties complete — for that chick. Over a two or three month period the pair does return to the same nest site and repeats the reproductive process up to a dozen times: digging, laying, covering, walking away.

Taking a running start at life

When a maleo chick hatches after 60-90 days of incubation, it hits the ground running. Literally.

The first thing the chick must do is burrow to the surface, sometimes through a meter of soil or sand, a harrowing task that can take up to two days. Next, the maleo instinctively makes a break for the forest; running and even flying.

“Watching a maleo chick come out of the ground and fly away is a remarkable sight,” says Iwan Hunowu, a maleo conservationist for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Indonesia Program (WCS Indonesia). In fact, this astonishing behavior at such a young age makes maleos among the most physically-mature vertebrate newborns on the planet.

One of Mr. Hunowu’s colleagues, Matt Leggett, notes that a freshly-hatched maleo is surprisingly tenacious: “The first chick I saw hatch took to the air but landed in a river, where it swam 10 meters [33 feet] through sizable rapids, climbed up the opposite bank, then flew off again.” Not bad for a two-day-old.

The maleo’s unique life cycle — particularly its utter reliance on conspicuous and exposed communal nest sites — has made the species vulnerable to human threats. Sulawesi villagers have a long history of harvesting, then selling the protein-laden eggs. In addition to human nest site poachers, there is the problem of vanishing habitat; the distance between coastal nest sites and the forests where the birds live continues to widen.

Farmers, with few economic alternatives, clear away the Sulawesi forests for agriculture, while cash-strapped local governments open them for logging. At some point, maleos regard the expanding gap between nest and forest as unacceptable, perhaps understanding that a two-day-old bird cannot cross the gauntlet of that ever-widening barrier, and another historical nest site is abandoned.

Saving Sulawesi’s maleos

The first efforts to protect maleos began in the 1980s and took on added urgency in the early 2000s, when a survey reported abandonment of more than half the known nest sites in northern Sulawesi. Across the island as a whole, 48 of the 142 known nesting grounds had been abandoned by 2002, another 51 were severely threatened, and 32 were threatened.

In 2001, WCS Indonesia began protecting nest sites at Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park on the northern Minahasa Peninsula, and the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation helped initiate a ban on egg collecting in 2004 on the East Peninsula. In both locations, maleo protection programs developed in partnership with local interest groups and were underpinned by the idea that villagers living near nest sites have the most to gain by maleo conservation.

Former poachers and other villagers were hired to monitor maleo nest sites, thus swapping an illegal lifestyle for a sustainable one. In addition to deterring poaching, these monitors also assess population size by documenting the number of adult maleos that visit nest sites, and they transplant some eggs to a semi-natural, fenced-off section of ground where they are protected from predators.

While the egg guardians may have initially signed on due to the financial incentive — one can earn a better income protecting maleo eggs than stealing them — a number of villagers now rally around the maleo as a source of local pride.

However, conservation groups recognize that the guardian model, largely funded via a perpetual cycle of grant applications, awards, and reports, is not necessarily sustainable: pride cannot pay the bills. Conservationists worry that one day a major grant will fail to materialize and maleo protectors will go unpaid, perhaps causing desperate guardians to revert to poaching in order to provide for their families.

The bird watching bonanza

Luckily, maleos can offer something more to human communities. Sulawesi is thought to support a greater number of endemic birds than anywhere else in the world, with 41 species found nowhere else, and a staggering 12 endemic genera. This fact is especially significant for the throngs of affluent birdwatchers staring at 41 empty check boxes on their life lists.

Jon Riley, the Program Manager for WCS Indonesia at the inception of the maleo conservation program, notes that the maleo’s gaudy flair for the bizarre gives it broad appeal beyond birdwatchers: these are not the macaques (loved by tourists but despised by villagers for the crop damage they cause), or drab songbirds that vanish into the foliage and about which locals cannot understand why all the fuss is being made. Maleos, with their conspicuous pit-digging antics and track star two-day-old chicks, are celebrities for all.

Maleo-focused conservation groups have wisely tapped into this universal interest, and many of the protected nest sites now offer eco-tours to generate additional and more reliable income for local villages.

Visiting a maleo nest site, says Mr. Riley, is fascinating: “it’s a tactile species: you can see them, hear their unusual vocalizations, see their burrows, handle their eggs — and once an audience is hooked, guides can pivot the dialogue from ecology to conservation. [Guides] explain that maleos are endemic to Sulawesi and in need of our help.”

Maleos on the beach, and in the Big Apple

In 2008, and with support from WCS Indonesia, an NGO called Pelestari Alam Liar dan Satwa (PALS) took maleo conservation to a new level: they bought the beach. Specifically, a 22-hectare (54 acre) patch of sand and trees centered on a maleo nest site. In doing so they created the Binerean Nature Reserve. The former landowners, a collection of coconut farmers, were then hired to manage the park with PALS oversight. The farmers now harvest their coconuts in a “maleo-friendly” fashion.

This enterprise ideally balances the needs of people and maleos. It maintains pre-park levels of income for local landowners, provides funding for reserve management and protection, while at the same time guaranteeing disturbance-free nesting for maleos. It’s the difficult win-win scenario conservationists are continually seeking.

This success story led to additional PALS land purchases. Today nearly 150 hectares (370 acres) of maleo habitat is under sustainable maleo management. That includes a forest corridor between Binerean Nature Reserve and Sulawesi’s closest national park.

Still, maleo reproductive conditions aren’t perfect. Even with poacher and nest predator deterrents, maleo hatching success rates in the wild only hover around 50 percent. Conservationists, eager to increase those odds to help the species rebound, found help in an urban setting halfway around the globe: WCS’s Bronx Zoo in New York City. This zoo is now the only place on earth, outside of Sulawesi, where birders and other visitors can see maleos.

The zoo’s ornithological staff has, over time, painstakingly replicated natural breeding conditions there. Each of the two zoo-kept maleo pairs is furnished with a “pit room” boasting a meter-deep sandbox with pockets warmed to 33ᵒC (91ᵒF). Such fussy conditions are vital to reproduction: if the maleos can’t find the perfect temperature, they will dig but won’t lay eggs. Staff keep close tabs on breeding behavior and swoop in to remove an egg for artificial incubation the moment it is laid. But how do keepers know when laying is imminent?

“The critical moment is the ‘peanut test,’” laughed Alana O’Sullivan, a Senior Wild Animal Keeper in a recent conversation in the off-exhibit maleo breeding wing of the Bronx Zoo. Apparently, maleos will do anything within their power to acquire – then rapidly consume – a peanut. The moment this treat is offered and refused, the staff know a female is singularly focused on reproduction: she’ll lay sometime within the next 24 hours.

After six years of brow-furrowing trial and error, in which zoo staff tested the impact of varying factors such as substrate type, temperature, and relative humidity on egg development, the Bronx Zoo is now able to hatch maleo eggs with an impressive 91 percent success rate — almost twice as high as in the wild.

Eggs are carefully scooped out of the warm sandpits and positioned in a beaker of sterilized plastic beads with a strict temperature of 32.5ᵒC (90.5ᵒF), and a relative humidity of 89-90%. This maleo cookbook has been shared with incubators on Sulawesi nearly 10,000 miles away, thus improving hatch success in situ, and resulting in more maleo chicks fluttering resolutely toward the tree line.

Hope for Sulawesi’s maleo megapode

While there have been clear, quantifiable conservation successes both in the wild and in captivity, whether those efforts translate to improving maleo numbers is less obvious. True, more than 10,000 maleo chicks have been successfully hatched and released from WCS-managed sites alone over the past 15 years, but what happens to those birds post-release remains largely unknown. How many actually survive to breed themselves? No one can say.

One positive indication comes from “translocation” programs, where eggs from an active nest site are transferred to the sands of an abandoned nest site; some such chicks have grown to adulthood and returned to renew the breeding cycle at those once-silent beaches.

Another indication comes from the village of Libuun, where after a decade of egg protection and community involvement overseen by the Alliance for Tompotika Conservation, the number of adult maleos recorded at the nest site there has tripled.

However, for the momentum of maleo conservation to continue on a positive trajectory, the focus should remain on protecting and restoring nest sites and forest habitat, rather than encouraging more hatcheries and more chicks. Without maleo habitat for these chicks to return to the hatcheries themselves are useless.

As stunning as the maleo conservation success story is, the price for the species rescue is even more astounding. The job is being done on the cheap, and is comparatively inexpensive. Each fledged chick represents a mere $4 investment, with the combined WCS-managed sites on the Minahasa Peninsula operating on only about $40,000 annually. However, maleo conservationists lament that even that modest sum is raised with difficulty and they could really use more: $100,000 annually would be optimal to ensure site protection, build community outreach, and conduct research.

It’s easy to lose hope under the barrage of negative wildlife news; the never-ending Twitter feeds regarding severed rhino horns or suitcases bursting with pangolin scales. But thanks to a motley team of conservationists, former egg poachers, coconut farmers, international birders, and Bronx zookeepers, there’s hope for the maleo yet. And that, my friends, is a conservation success story worth savoring and celebrating.

0,"SCIENTISTS are trying to solve the mystery of why rat-kangaroos are disappearing from Cairns’ rainforests.

Researchers from across Australia gathered in Cairns yesterday to discuss the reasons why mammal numbers are declining across Northern Australia.

James Cook University researcher Dr Sandra Abell is exploring the decline of one of three populations of the northern bettong, Bettongia tropica, which has disappeared from the Wet Tropics rainforest behind Cairns.

The northern bettong is a small grey macropod that, up until 1976, when one was discovered­ east of Mareeba, had not been seen for more than 40 years.

There are only three known population groups of the animals within a 500sq km area across the North.

media_camera SHY: The northern bettong is a small grey macropod that, up until 1976, when one was discovered­ east of Mareeba, had not been seen for more than 40 years. PICTURE: SUPPLIED

They inhabit an area from Mt Windsor Tableland, northwest of Mossman, to Coane Range, south of Ingham.

The Lamb Range, 25km southeast of Mareeba, is the species’ stronghold.

Dr Abell said disease could be responsible for the endangered animals’ decline.

“The problem, really, for bettongs, is we don’t have any data,’’ she said.

“We know they are in decline and there are other diseases involved, including changes in habitat relating to inadequate or changed fire regimes, and there’s also a problem potentially with climate change with drought increasing in intensity and frequency, which can cause problems for bettongs.

“We also know that predators have a high impact on bettongs for other parts of Australia, but we haven’t done a risk assessment to see whether diseases are also impacting, or potentially impacting in the future.”

She said the marsupials, which were cute animals, played an important role in the rainforest ecosystem.

“They have a really special diet that’s very interesting – they mostly feed on truffle fungi,’’ she said.

“The fungi is actually what everyone should worry about, because the bettongs disperse the fungi and the fungi also feeds the plants, giving them nutrients and protecting them from pathogens, basically making the forest healthy.

“Losing the bettong means there’s going to be a potential problem with the dispersal of the fungi, and the health of the forest, which is important for people.”",Why are Cairns’ bettongs disappearing?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYWlybnNwb3N0LmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL2NhaXJucy1nb25lLXdpbGQvd2h5LWFyZS1jYWlybnMtYmV0dG9uZ3MtZGlzYXBwZWFyaW5nL25ld3Mtc3RvcnkvNTE4MGQ3MDAzZDMyZmM4MGRhZDJmNzFiYmZjYWRhM2TSAYQBaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY2Fpcm5zcG9zdC5jb20uYXUvbmV3cy9jYWlybnMtZ29uZS13aWxkL3doeS1hcmUtY2Fpcm5zLWJldHRvbmdzLWRpc2FwcGVhcmluZy9uZXdzLXN0b3J5LzUxODBkNzAwM2QzMmZjODBkYWQyZjcxYmJmY2FkYTNk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f858f5bea6ff42df1dcf1cd787586035,2015-10-29,"{'sent': 'SCIENTISTS are trying to solve the mystery of why rat-kangaroos are disappearing from Cairns’ rainforests.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['SCIENTISTS'], 'GPE': ['Cairns']}}","SCIENTISTS are trying to solve the mystery of why rat-kangaroos are disappearing from Cairns’ rainforests.

0,"Over half of all primate species are today classified as threatened with extinction, due mainly to habitat loss, particularly from the clearing and burning of tropical forests, illegal wildlife trade, and the hunting of primates for food, according to a list compiled by the Bristol Zoological Society, Conservation International, the International Primatological Society, and the Primate Specialist Group of IUCN’s Species Survival Commission.

Some new species have been added to the threatened list, which is updated every two years, including the Lavasoa Mountains dwarf lemur and Philippine tarsier.

Just 25 wild Hainan gibbons left

There are only 25 individual Hainan gibbons left in the wild. According to the Zoological Society of London, the Hainan gibbon is the world’s rarest ape, rarest primate, and likely the rarest mammal species.

In the 1950s there were about 2,000 Hainan gibbons in the wild. Today they are restricted to a single patch of forest in Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan Island, China.

Similarly, there are just 50 Northern sportive lemurs left in the wild – all of them in Madagascar. Also known as the Sahafary sportive lemur or Northern weasel lemur, it has suffered severe ecological and human pressures.

Threatened primate species across the globe

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species includes five primate species from Madagascar, five from Africa, five from Central and South America, and ten from Asia. They are all in need of urgent conservation action, says the Bristol Zoological Society.

The list was drawn up by primatologists working in the field who have first-hand exprence of the causes of threats to primates. World-leading primatologist, Dr. Christoph Schwitzer, Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society, was one of the editors of the report.

Regarding the significance of the report, Dr. Schwitzer said:

“This research highlights the extent of the danger facing many of the world’s primates. We hope it will focus people’s attention on these lesser known primate species, some of which most people will probably have never heard of, such as the Lavasoa Mountains dwarf lemur from Madagascar – a species only discovered two years ago – or the Roloway monkey from Ghana and Ivory Coast, which we believe is on the very verge of extinction.”

“Some of these animals have tiny populations remaining in the wild and support and action to help save them is vital if we are to avoid losing these wonderful animals forever.”

Every two years, the list of threatened primate species gets longer. (Source: Bristol Zoological Society)

Larger primates prime targets for bushmeat hunting

Vietnam and Madagascar both have several highly threatened primate species. In Africa, the genus of the red colobus monkeys is under severe threat, as are several of the spider monkeys and howler monkeys of South America. All of these species are fairly large and conspicuous, making them vulnerable targets for bushmeat hunting.

Dr. Russell Mittermeier, Chair of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group and Executive Vice Chair of Conservation International, explained:

“The purpose of our Top 25 list is to highlight those primates most at risk, to attract the attention of the public, to stimulate national governments to do more, and especially to find the resources to implement desperately needed conservation measures. In particular, we want to encourage governments to commit to desperately needed biodiversity conservation measures.”

“What is more, beyond the great scientific interest of primates, there is increasing evidence that certain species may play a key role in dispersing the seeds of tropical forest tree species that have a critically important role in mitigating climate change – a particularly noteworthy consideration given the upcoming conference of the parties of the climate convention in Paris.”

SOS (Save Our Species), an initiative managed by IUCN, announced in October locally-implemented projects to protect the Alaotra gentle lemur and Northern sportive lemur. Even so, SOS emphasizes, much still needs to be done for other species.

Dr Schwitzer said:

“This report makes scary reading for primatologists and the public alike, and highlights where we as conservationists must focus our attention over the coming years. However, it also demonstrates the growing importance of collaboration between the international conservation, research and zoo communities in the protection of species and habitats.”

“At Bristol Zoological Society we will continue our conservation and research with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of the conservation activities, as well as increasing our understanding of these, and other, critically endangered species.”

The report of the 25 most endangered primates in the world was compiled by 63 experts from across the globe. It was launched at Singapore Zoo today (24 November) with guests from national research and conservation organisations.

There are only 25 individual Hainan gibbons left in the wild. According to the Zoological Society of London, the Hainan gibbon is the world’s rarest ape, rarest primate, and likely the rarest mammal species.

In the 1950s there were about 2,000 Hainan gibbons in the wild. Today they are restricted to a single patch of forest in Bawangling National Nature Reserve on Hainan Island, China.

Similarly, there are just 50 Northern sportive lemurs left in the wild – all of them in Madagascar. Also known as the Sahafary sportive lemur or Northern weasel lemur, it has suffered severe ecological and human pressures.

Threatened primate species across the globe

The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species includes five primate species from Madagascar, five from Africa, five from Central and South America, and ten from Asia. They are all in need of urgent conservation action, says the Bristol Zoological Society.

The list was drawn up by primatologists working in the field who have first-hand exprence of the causes of threats to primates. World-leading primatologist, Dr. Christoph Schwitzer, Director of Conservation at Bristol Zoological Society, was one of the editors of the report.

Regarding the significance of the report, Dr. Schwitzer said:

“This research highlights the extent of the danger facing many of the world’s primates. We hope it will focus people’s attention on these lesser known primate species, some of which most people will probably have never heard of, such as the Lavasoa Mountains dwarf lemur from Madagascar – a species only discovered two years ago – or the Roloway monkey from Ghana and Ivory Coast, which we believe is on the very verge of extinction.”

“Some of these animals have tiny populations remaining in the wild and support and action to help save them is vital if we are to avoid losing these wonderful animals forever.”

Every two years, the list of threatened primate species gets longer. (Source: Bristol Zoological Society)

Larger primates prime targets for bushmeat hunting

Vietnam and Madagascar both have several highly threatened primate species. In Africa, the genus of the red colobus monkeys is under severe threat, as are several of the spider monkeys and howler monkeys of South America. All of these species are fairly large and conspicuous, making them vulnerable targets for bushmeat hunting.

Dr. Russell Mittermeier, Chair of the IUCN/SSC Primate Specialist Group and Executive Vice Chair of Conservation International, explained:

“The purpose of our Top 25 list is to highlight those primates most at risk, to attract the attention of the public, to stimulate national governments to do more, and especially to find the resources to implement desperately needed conservation measures. In particular, we want to encourage governments to commit to desperately needed biodiversity conservation measures.”

“What is more, beyond the great scientific interest of primates, there is increasing evidence that certain species may play a key role in dispersing the seeds of tropical forest tree species that have a critically important role in mitigating climate change – a particularly noteworthy consideration given the upcoming conference of the parties of the climate convention in Paris.”

SOS (Save Our Species), an initiative managed by IUCN, announced in October locally-implemented projects to protect the Alaotra gentle lemur and Northern sportive lemur. Even so, SOS emphasizes, much still needs to be done for other species.

Dr Schwitzer said:

“This report makes scary reading for primatologists and the public alike, and highlights where we as conservationists must focus our attention over the coming years. However, it also demonstrates the growing importance of collaboration between the international conservation, research and zoo communities in the protection of species and habitats.”

“At Bristol Zoological Society we will continue our conservation and research with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of the conservation activities, as well as increasing our understanding of these, and other, critically endangered species.”

The report of the 25 most endangered primates in the world was compiled by 63 experts from across the globe. It was launched at Singapore Zoo today (24 November) with guests from national research and conservation organisations.

0,"The Brigalow Belt in Queensland is a national hotspot for wildlife, especially for birds and reptiles. Many of these, such as the black-throated finch, golden-tailed gecko and brigalow scaly-foot are found nowhere else in the world.

But the region is also one of the most transformed and contested areas in Australia. People want to use the Brigalow for many different things: conservation, grazing, agricultural production, mineral and gas extraction. This region also overlaps with the country’s largest reserves of coal and coal seam gas.

Together, the economic activities in the region bring land clearing, changes to water sources, invasion of exotic species and changed fire patterns, which threaten the region’s unique biodiversity.

Currently, at least 179 species of plants and animals are known to be threatened in the region. In research published today we look at the best way to conserve these species, attempting to balance the competing uses of this region.

Meet the locals

The Brigalow Belt bioregion takes its name from the Aboriginal word “brigalow” that describes the region’s dominant tree species (Acacia harpophylla). Brigalow trees can grow up to 25 metres in height and are characterised by their silver foliage.

Rocio Ponce-Reyes , Author provided

Brigalow ecosystems once formed extensive open-forest woodlands that covered 30% of the region, but since the mid-19th century about 95% of their original extent has been cleared, mostly for farming. The remaining 600,000 hectares of relatively small, isolated and fragmented remnants of brigalow forest are now protected as an endangered ecological community. The Semi-Evergreen Vine Thicket, or bottle tree scrub, is also listed.

Mammals are the most threatened group of the region. Eight species are already extinct, some of them locally (such as the eastern quoll and northern bettong) and others globally (such as the Darling Downs hopping mouse).

Other iconic mammals in the region include the bridled nail-tail wallaby and the northern hairy-nosed wombat. Both are listed as endangered at federal and state levels.

Long history of transformation

Traditional owners managed the region, including through burning practices, until the arrival of the first European settlers in the 1840s. Since then, management practices have changed markedly, especially with the establishment of the Brigalow and Other Lands Development Scheme in the 1950s.

This scheme provided new settlers, including many soldiers returning from the second world war, with infrastructure, financial assistance and a block of bushland. In return, they were expected to clear their land and establish a farm within 15 years to support the growing Queensland population.

Since then, the rate of clearing of Brigalow has varied in response to changes in legislation through time.

The Brigalow’s silver lining

There are many ways of dealing with the threats facing the Brigalow’s biodiversity. But which gives us the most bang for our buck?

We worked with 40 key stakeholders from the region to answer this question.

You might think there’s a simple answer: stop development. However, native plants and animals in the Brigalow region are threatened by an accumulation of past, current and future land uses, and all need to be addressed to save these species.

Stakeholders focused on the strategies they believed to be the most feasible and achievable for minimising negative impacts and managing threats arising from all land uses in the region. The strategies, listed below, target several threats posed by industries in the region, such as agriculture, grazing, coal mining and coal seam gas.

Protect remnant vegetation Protect important regrowth vegetation Establish key biodiversity areas, such as identify and manage areas of critical habitat Restore key habitats Manage pest animals such as feral cats, pigs and noisy miners Manage invasive plants Manage fire Manage grazing Manage water Manage pollution Build a common vision

The stakeholders included a strategy to “build a common vision” because they saw this as vital to achieving the other strategies. This common vision would be built by stakeholders to identify shared goals that balance environmental, social and economic considerations, such as the extent and nature of future developments.

Eric Vanderduys , Author provided

We discovered that managing fire and invasive plant species would provide the best bang for our buck in terms of protecting the Brigalow Belt’s threatened plants and animals. Protecting remaining stands of vegetation offered high benefits to native wildlife, but came at high economic costs. We also discovered that building a common vision will improve the effectiveness of the other management strategies.

Experts estimated that it would cost about A$57.5 million each year to implement all 11 proposed management strategies in the Brigalow Belt. This is around A$1.60 per hectare each year.

If we don’t make this investment, it’s likely 21 species will disappear from the region over the next 50 years. But if we implement the 11 strategies, 12 of these species will likely survive (including the regent honeyeater, northern quoll and bridled nail-tail wallaby) and the outlook of many other species will improve. Species-specific recovery plans may help stop the other nine species (such as the northern-hairy nosed wombat and the swift parrot) from being lost from the region.

A Welsh adventurer has completed a world-first trek, by walking the entire length of Madagascar.

Ash Dykes, from Colwyn Bay , an ambassador for the Wales Year of Adventure, is no stranger to a challenge.

He became the first person in history to complete a solo and unsupported trek across Mongolia last year at the age of 23.

And his most recent expedition in Madagascar, which took 155 days to complete, saw Ash walk more than 3.5 million steps to reach the most northerly point of the island, Cap d’Ambre, early on Monday morning.

He also summited Madagascar’s eight highest mountains on his way.

“This is, without a doubt, the hardest and most demanding challenge I’ve taken on - there were times it nearly broke me so reaching the finish line was quite overwhelming.”

He met local inhabitants along the 1,600 mile trek, and one tribe gifted him a chicken ahead of his journey to the summit of the highest mountain on the island, Maromokotro.

He was told to set it free at the summit, which he did, to destroy bad spirits and to bring a safe descent.

The adventurer faced perilous and demanding terrain, with sweltering deserts and sand dunes in the south of Madagascar and dense jungle and rainforest in the north.

He also had to adjust to extreme weather conditions, with temperatures ranging from 0C to 45C.

And to make matters worse the adventurer contracted the most deadly strain of malaria 12 weeks ago, leaving him hours from death and needing emergency medical treatment.

“Early signs were very similar to severe heat exhaustion but, within a few days, symptoms worsened and I was suffering with severe sickness and hallucinations,” Ash said.

“It was at this point I knew something was seriously wrong and decided to travel three hours by car to the nearest city – Fianaratsoa – for urgent medical attention.”

The determined explorer spent just five days in recovery before continuing on his trek.

More recently he suffered an adverse reaction to a spider bite that caused his arms to blister and has narrowly avoided scorpions, snakes and poisonous centipedes.

But he said the people he met along the way made the journey so fulfilling.

“The people are some of the most hospitable I’ve met and to be welcomed by tribes that, until now, have never even seen a foreigner was very special,” Ash said.

“Seeing how locals not only survive but thrive in remote and often perilous areas has been eye-opening.”

Madagascar is one of the world’s biodiversity hot-spots where around 75% of species are unique to the area.

Sadly, deforestation is causing habitat and wildlife loss and Ash chose to venture through Madagascar to see this problem first-hand.

Ash visited several conservationists across the island from the Lemur Conservation Network, who protect the island’s most famous inhabitants, the lemur, the world’s most endangered group of mammals.

He also witnessed an ongoing battle created by rampant forest fires destroying the land, and the simultaneous reforestation and habitat protection efforts.

“Madagascar is a country of stark contrast with some very real environmental issues and a big part of the expedition was to highlight this,” Ash said.

“There’s a huge threat to a lot of the island’s endemic species but so many conservationists are in place to rescue and protect them with very positive achievements.

A Welsh adventurer has completed a world-first trek, by walking the entire length of Madagascar.

Ash Dykes, from Colwyn Bay , an ambassador for the Wales Year of Adventure, is no stranger to a challenge.

He became the first person in history to complete a solo and unsupported trek across Mongolia last year at the age of 23.

And his most recent expedition in Madagascar, which took 155 days to complete, saw Ash walk more than 3.5 million steps to reach the most northerly point of the island, Cap d’Ambre, early on Monday morning.

He also summited Madagascar’s eight highest mountains on his way.

0,"Welsh adventurer Ash Dykes just became one of the few people on the planet to ever see two of Madagascar’s rarest, most critically endangered species, the northern sportive lemur and the Madagascan pochard duck.

All it took to achieve these feats was for Dykes to walk 1,600 miles, hack through impenetrable jungles, climb eight mountains, cross a desert, and run from a forest fire. Along the way, he nearly died from malaria, almost got washed away by rushing rivers, suffered painful spider bites, and avoided a parade of enormous snakes, giant scorpions, and poisonous centipedes.

Dykes said it was all worth it to complete his 155-day, world-record expedition, which made him the first person to cross Madagascar on foot.

“I really shocked myself and learned a lot about myself here,” the 25-year-old said by phone, just hours after completing his epic trek.

He also learned a lot about Madagascar’s unique wildlife. On his first day, while sitting on a sand dune on the country’s southern coast, he witnessed a humpback whale jumping out of the Indian Ocean. As his journey progressed, he spotted dozens if not hundreds of other wildlife species, including five other kinds of lemurs, chameleons, snakes, small mammals, and huge butterflies that he described as being like something out of the movie Avatar.

Seeing the northern sportive lemur toward the end of the journey—a major goal of the expedition—proved one of the most exciting moments, although Dykes reported that it was extremely fleeting. “I only just got a glimpse of it,” he said. “It was sleeping in its hole in its tree, but we were too loud approaching. It just ran up the tree, jumped away, and was gone.”

The encounter with pochard ducks was also memorable. “We were just hacking our way through pure difficult jungle,” Dykes said, “and then all of sudden, three-quarters of the way up, it goes flat and opens up into this sort of grass field with a lake in the middle.” Swimming comfortably in the lake were the ducks—some of the last 40 or so members of the species in existence.

In addition to the wonder, however, Dykes witnessed the environmental threats and deforestation the entire country faces.

“At night we could see the forest fires lighting up the sides of mountains,” Dykes said. “Other times we were talking through dense jungles, and all of a sudden, it just opened up where all the trees were cut down. It’s a huge shame.”

He emphasized, though, that the positives he encountered far outweighed the negatives. “Throughout the whole country you had the hospitality of the locals, you had the good food, you had the wildlife,” he said. “You had the challenges, sure, and they were really difficult, but once you got through them, you’ve got a nice meal being cooked—that’s all positive.”

Dykes also praised the conservationists he met along his journey. “They’re doing incredible things to restore Madagascar, its wild species, and its forests,” he said. He pointed out one project that planted 10,000 trees last year. “You don’t see that in the newspaper,” he said. “Sometimes that incredible work gets overlooked because people look into the negatives rather than the positives.”

Lynne Venart, cofounder of the Lemur Conservation Network, said Dykes’ journey and online accounts helped to create enthusiasm for Madagascar and its wildlife.

“Because Madagascar is so remote, most people have never been there, have no idea what the terrain is like, don’t know anything about the Malagasy people or realize that so much unique wildlife is found there and nowhere else,” she said. “It’s been a lot of fun to be able to track Ash through social media as he walked through the remotest parts of this island and hear firsthand what it’s like, who he met, and the challenges he faced.”

As he waited for his flight back home to the United Kingdom in a few days, Dykes said he hoped the people who followed his journey online were inspired to take action and to feel that they could make a difference.

0,"Conservation groups, university researchers and government departments are banding together to save one of Australia's smallest endangered marsupials in the northern part of the Great Dividing Range.

With an average body length of just over 30 centimetres and weighing little more than one kilogram, northern bettong are as tiny as they are elusive.

The saving grace for people trying to save the species is that the only known populations of northern bettong are concentrated into isolated pockets of far north Queensland, namely in the Lamb Range, west of Cairns.

""Bettong live in a really specialised habitat in the drier open woodland behind the rainforest, but before it gets a lot drier inland,"" said Jess Koleck, coordinator of World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Australia's northern bettong monitoring project.

Living in such a specialised habitat means northern bettong have developed a specialised diet of truffles that grow in the nutrient-depleted soil.

""We've sampled over 70 different species of truffles from these areas so there's a huge diversity growing underground,"" Ms Koleck said.

She said while the kinds of truffles bettong ate looked similar to those used in upscale restaurants, they certainly did not taste the same.

""The bettongs absolutely love them; they'll sniff them out, dig them up and eat them — especially [in summer] when they're abundant, they don't eat much else.""

Small holes dug into the moist soil indicate that bettong have been actively digging for truffles in the area. ( ABC Far North: Mark Rigby )

'Labour intensive' trapping

In collaboration with Queensland government departments, James Cook University and community organisations, WWF Australia is in the middle of a five-year northern bettong monitoring project.

""Part of the project is looking at how many bettongs are out there, and the only way we know how to do that at the moment is by cage trapping,"" Ms Koleck said.

""We're catching the animals, marking them and then doing recaptures, and from that data we'll be able to get an estimate of population in the area.""

While the last time bettong populations were monitored in this way was more than 20 years ago, the method has barely changed.

Cage traps are carried by hand up sometimes steep hills before being placed in strategic locations the bettong are known to inhabit.

""One of the drawbacks of cage trapping is that while it gives us really good data, it's really hard and labour intensive,"" Ms Koleck said.

""We're doing this four times a year at three different sites and there's 53 cage traps at each different site, so it's a massive effort.""

Sardines and scats

Despite their taste for truffles, northern bettong find bait balls made from a mixture of sardines, oats, honey, peanut butter and vanilla irresistible.

""They're all things that bettongs love the smell of,"" Ms Koleck laughed.

""We use that to entice them into the cage and once they're in the door closes behind them.""

She said to make the animal feel as comfortable as possible, and to protect them from the elements, grass was placed on top of and around the cage.

""These animals build their nests in grass and if it's dark and secure inside the trap they stay really calm.""

Underneath the trap is a piece of clean black plastic used to collect scats dropped by the animals while they are in captivity.

It is from those scats that researchers are able to record genetic information about individual animals.

Technology, tape and spit-balls

Because cage trapping is such hard work for those involved, WWF and their project partners are exploring other methods of monitoring far north Queensland's bettong populations.

As well as hair trapping — using a special form of sticky tape to pull hairs from bettong as they brush against it — project collaborators are taking advantage of one of the northern bettong's more unusual feeding habits.

""Most of the year the bettongs rely on truffles, but in the times when it gets really dry and truffle abundance goes way down, they rely on a species of grass called cockatoo grass,"" Ms Koleck said.

""I guess the bettongs are a bit spoiled because they're used to eating truffles, so they chew up the base of the grass, get all the nutrients and moisture out and then spit it back out.""

She said these cockatoo grass spit-balls were known as oorts and were invaluable to bettong researchers.

""Oorts are kind of like a mouth swab because it's been in the mouth of the bettong and it's covered in saliva, which means it's also covered in their DNA.""

The most technologically advanced method of northern bettong monitoring, camera trapping, is used sparingly, mostly because of the expense involved.

""Camera traps are great because they reduce the amount of hours we need to spend in the bush, but we have to be picky about where we use them,"" Ms Koleck said.",All hands on deck to trap northern bettong in the name of conservation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDE2LTAzLTAxL3RyYXBwaW5nLW5vcnRoZXJuLWJldHRvbmctaW4tdGhlLW5hbWUtb2YtY29uc2VydmF0aW9uLzcyMTA0NjbSASZodHRwczovL2FtcC5hYmMubmV0LmF1L2FydGljbGUvNzIxMDQ2Ng?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/7208348-16x9-large.jpg?v=2,2016-03-01,"{'sent': ""Conservation groups, university researchers and government departments are banding together to save one of Australia's smallest endangered marsupials in the northern part of the Great Dividing Range.\n\n"", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Australia']}}","Conservation groups, university researchers and government departments are banding together to save one of Australia's smallest endangered marsupials in the northern part of the Great Dividing Range.

Snow Leopard

There's something magical about snow leopards. WCS's legendary conservationist George Schaller hints at it in his book, ""Stones of Silence,"" when he describes a memorable encounter in the hills of Pakistan in the 1970s. While hiking, he spotted the big cat roughly 150 feet away. ""Though snow soon capped her head and shoulders,"" he wrote, ""she remained, silent and still, seemingly impervious to the elements. Wisps of clouds swirled around, transforming her into a ghost creature, part myth and part reality.""

Snowy Owl

Not surprisingly, given its name, the snowy owl is well-adapted to wintry conditions . It's known to summer far north of the Arctic Circle. And unlike most owls, which hunt at night, the snowy owl is active during the day — a necessary adaption in a place where the sun sometimes doesn't go down at all. Come winter, the bird moves south, occasionally as far as the southern United States.

Brown Bears

In the wild, these bears hibernate in winter. They'll often set up a den — perhaps along a sheltered slope, under a large rock or between the roots of a large tree — and return to it each year. Female grizzlies typically give birth to two cubs in January or February. The newborns are blind, hairless and tiny, weighing less than a lb. They stay in the safe surroundings of the den until springtime, by which time they've grown to about 20 lbs.

White-naped Crane

Tall and regal, white-naped cranes are migratory birds found in Russia, China, Mongolia, and North and South Korea. They are considered a conservation priority for WCS's program in Mongolia, where the birds face serious threats that include agricultural development and habitat loss through the drying of wetlands due to climate change.

Amur Tiger

Earlier this year, word spread online about Zolushka, an orphaned Amur tiger that was nursed back to health by conservationists in Russia before being returned to the wild. Thanks to photographs from camera traps in the field, we now know she has two cubs of her own. This is particularly welcome news, because there are only some 350 to 400 Amur tigers left in the wild, almost exclusively in the Russian Far East, where they endure cold winters. Researchers have identified the distribution of prey species as the most important factor in determining the tigers' geographic distribution.

Snow Monkey

Next to humans, no primate lives as far north as these animals do in Japan. They endure the cold, snowy winters by soaking in natural hot springs, and they take refuge from the summer heat by plunging into cold pools. Also a bit like humans, they're social. They live in big troops, averaging 40 to 200 individuals, can make up to 30 vocalizations, and use body and facial expressions.",Snowscapes Show Wonder of Animals in Winter (Photos),https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy55YWhvby5jb20vc25vd3NjYXBlcy1zaG93LXdvbmRlci1hbmltYWxzLXdpbnRlci1waG90b3MtMTU1NzQ4NDkzLmh0bWzSAVpodHRwczovL25ld3MueWFob28uY29tL2FtcGh0bWwvc25vd3NjYXBlcy1zaG93LXdvbmRlci1hbmltYWxzLXdpbnRlci1waG90b3MtMTU1NzQ4NDkzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tf4mLN.Mu1cYNiqE.u6aqA--~B/aD0zODQ7dz01NzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_US/News/LiveScience.com/snow-animals-5-amur-tiger-julian.jpg1457569055,2016-03-16,"{'sent': 'Earlier this year, word spread online about Zolushka, an orphaned Amur tiger that was nursed back to health by conservationists in Russia before being returned to the wild.', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Zolushka'], 'GPE': ['Russia']}}","Earlier this year, word spread online about Zolushka, an orphaned Amur tiger that was nursed back to health by conservationists in Russia before being returned to the wild.

0,"I sat in the passenger seat of Juan Trujillo’s pickup truck, careening through a dense forest in northern Guatemala. The road we were driving on—and I use the word road here with some hesitation—was simply a deeply grooved dirt trail that had been coarsely etched through the jungle so that trucks like this one could travel between the town of Flores, a lovely little place overrun by tourists on an island in the middle of a scenic lake, and the many tiny villages and Mayan ruins that dot the northern jungles. Rains had turned parts of the road into muddy mush, and the trip was about as smooth as the swirling teacup ride at Disneyland. I was being jarred in all directions, my head occasionally thumping up against the roof of the truck, as I tried to do some basic fourth-grade mathematical calculations using the numbers that I had written down in my little notebook at the village we’d just departed.

In that village—it’s called Carmelita—as in several other villages in the northern Guatemalan region of Petén, farmers make a modest living by selling products harvested from the forest itself. These include both wood products and nonwood products like pepper, a tree gum called chicle that is used to make chewing gum, and ramón, a seed that apparently the Mayans munched on while constructing their intricate temples and that the Guatemalan chamber of commerce would like to market as the next international superfood of the 21st century. The farmers also tend to various types of palm trees. Not the tall, swaying, tropical, coconut-bearing palm trees of Southern California or Miami Beach, but squat little plants and bushes that sit in the shade of the forest and whose leaves are harvested and sent overseas to be used in floral arrangements and carried aloft by celebrants during the spring holiday of Palm Sunday.

Palm Sunday is a Christian holiday that falls on the Sunday before Easter and commemorates the day that Jesus Christ entered the holy city of Jerusalem while crowds of admirers laid down palm leaves on the ground before him.

Like most people, before I started working on this book, I had never considered for a second where the palm leaves used every year for this holiday actually come from. It turns out they come from a handful of Latin American countries, including Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico, and it also turns out that for the most part they are harvested in a haphazard fashion without any regard to the long-term sustainability of the forests. There are, however, some exceptions.

In a few select villages in northern Guatemala and the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, local farmers—with the help of savvy non-governmental environmental organizations, forward-looking governmental agencies, and a conglomeration of religious organizations in the United States that have come together under the leadership of an unassuming University of Minnesota professor to form the so-called “Eco Palm” project— have revolutionized the way that palm leaves are harvested in the region.

In February 2012, I spent a week in Guatemala and Mexico to learn about these harvesting techniques so I could understand what role religious groups have played in both creating and solving the problem of palm deforestation. But why was I furiously doing long division in the front seat of a pickup truck tromping through the Guatemalan jungle? We’ll get to that.

***

I first learned about the potentially deleterious effects of Palm Sunday on Latin American forests when a colleague pointed me to a fascinating article about a Colombian bird published in Audubon magazine. In the piece, a terrific freelance writer named Susan McGrath tells the story of the yellow-eared parrot, a glorious creature, mostly bright green with yellow patches on the side of its head, that lives in a small area in the Andes Mountains of Colombia. The yellow-eared parrot is highly sensitive and can only nest in a single type of wax palm tree. Unfortunately for these feathered fellows, however, the local church in the region where the birds live had been using this tree’s leaves for its annual Palm Sunday celebration, thus decimating the tree population and driving the parrot to the brink of extinction. When the bird’s defenders first tried to convince the town’s priest to use a different type of palm, they were not well received. Specifically, according to McGrath, the priest “blew a gasket” and “admonished parishioners to stand fast and keep using the palms.” It was only when the priest was transferred and replaced by a more flexible religious leader that the bird lovers started to make progress. In the end, the church replaced the wax palm leaves with an abundant native species called iraca (which some still oppose because it is too “puny”), and as a result the birds have made a re- markable recovery.

The Eco Palm project that I mentioned earlier is another super-awesome effort to protect the unique environment where Palm Sunday palms grow. It can circuitously be traced back to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the 1994 accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that eliminated tariffs and other impediments to free trade among the three countries. One argument that free trade opponents often raise is that lifting barriers to trade can sometimes harm the environment. An importing country that cares a lot about the environment, for example, cannot always insist that an exporting country do things in an environmentally friendly way as a condition on importing the exporter’s goods.

An example of this problem occurred in the mid-’90s, when the United States insisted that it would only import shrimp caught in nets with a turtle-excluding device that would prevent shrimpers from inadvertently ensnaring and killing endangered sea turtles. This requirement was fine for big, rich Western shrimpers, but for poor independent shrimpers in places like Malaysia and Pakistan, installing these turtle excluding devices was completely unfeasible (the shrimpers’ yearly income in some cases was about the same amount as the cost of one device). These small shrimpers brought a high-profile case against the United States in front of the World Trade Organization, which ultimately held for the United States, but not without placing some limits on our ability to insist on environmentally friendly processes as a precondition to importing foreign goods.

Some environmentalists were really angry about this. If you remember back to 1999, when a loose and weird coalition of unions and environmental groups and anarchists (an- archists!) protested the WTO’s Seattle conference and caused all sorts of property damage—some called these events the Battle of Seattle—you might recall that a bunch of the protestors were dressed up as turtles. This is why.

Anyway, due to these concerns about free trade, the three NAFTA countries established an organization called the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to study NAFTA’s environmental effects and to take steps to mitigate them. Sometime in the late ’90s, the head of the Trade and Environment Program at CEC, a woman named Chantal Line-Carpentier, became aware that palm forests in southern Mexico were being harmed by unsustainable harvesting techniques. Line-Carpentier knew that consumers in the United States are often willing to pay a premium for products they know are helping (or at least not hurting) the environment. She had previously worked on projects to harness private market demand as a way of promoting sustainably grown coffee, and she wondered whether the same approach might help the palms.

In 2000, she contacted Dean Current, a forestry economist at the University of Minnesota who had a great deal of experience with Latin American forests, and asked him if he would conduct a study to figure out whether such a thing might be possible.

At first, Current was skeptical about doing the study. As he told me when we met in his office in the University of Minnesota’s Soil Science Building in St. Paul, he is trained as an economist, not a marketer. But he eventually agreed, and along with a graduate student, he not only visited and talked to all the wholesale florists in the Twin Cities but also did a nationwide study of the entire palm importing business in the United States. He learned that although most of the demand for palms from Latin America comes from florists who use the palms as part of floral displays, churches that buy palms for Palm Sunday also make up a significant portion of the market. Plus, many of these churches seemed to be quite willing to pay a little extra for palms that were sustainably harvested, if the churches were guaranteed that the additional money would go back to the communities to support sustainable practices and other important community needs, such as education. As Current put it when I asked him if any churches refused to participate in his program, “No one says that they don’t want to pay twenty more dollars for sustainability.” And thus, the EcoPalm project was born.

The project started small. In 2005, its pilot year, Current and a graduate student took orders themselves from religious congregations in Minnesota and North Dakota and delivered a total of about five thousand palm fronds to the churches from the back of a van. Over time, however, the project grew substantially. Current brought in religious organizations like Lutheran World Relief and the Episcopal Church to spread the word to their congregations, and he had a professional florist take care of the sales and deliveries. Media stories, like one published in the New York Times in 2007, brought the project added publicity. By 2012, the project filled orders for over nine hundred thousand fronds. This was still a relatively small percentage of the palms that are used in Palm Sunday services around the country, but it marked a great advance over the situation just a few years earlier, and it meant that a good deal of money was being sent to communities in need.

It was clear from what I had read about the EcoPalm project and talking to Professor Current that I had happened upon a very cool initiative that was providing real benefits to the environment. But I still had a lot of questions. What were these harvesting techniques that the villagers were using to protect the palm forests? What do palm forests even look like? Do the villagers know who was buying their palms, and why? Most importantly, how did these select villages in Guatemala and Mexico happen to develop sustainable harvesting techniques? Did the EcoPalm project, with its promise of paying extra for sustainably harvested palms, create the incen- tive to start harvesting the palms in a sustainable fashion, or were the palms already being harvested sustainably in some places? Reading the newspaper articles about the project, I believed that the EcoPalm project itself had created the incentives. The New York Times piece, for instance, suggested that the primary consumers of the sustainably harvested palms were indeed the churches. Was religion really that important of a factor here, either in creating or solving the palm forest crisis in Latin America? I wanted to learn more. And so I traveled south.

***

In 2013, I left for Guatemala in mid-February, which is a good time to leave for Guatemala if you live in Boston, where just the week before, we had received 23 inches of snow during a single storm. I had never been to Central America, so I was a little worried about the things that people who have never actually gone to Central America tend to be worried about when they go to Central America, like whether it was safe. The assistant dean who approved my funding for the trip didn’t exactly put me at ease when he told me there was “no money in the ransom budget, so be careful.” As it turned out, though, I had no use for such funds. The trip went as smooth as can be.

One thing that made my research in Guatemala and Mexico more difficult than it needed to be was my poor language skills. My Spanish is muy crappy. I should have taken Spanish in high school, but instead I took Latin, I guess because I thought it was more important to be able to talk with the pope than with the 350 million or so people who speak Spanish all over the world.

Anyway, a couple of years before I took this trip, for reasons I won’t get into, I decided to start studying Spanish. My university has a great perk that allows faculty members to take courses in other parts of the school for free. So one summer, I enrolled in Introduction to Spanish, along with 15 19 year olds. Let me tell you, when you’re an old guy and you take a class with a bunch of kids who were born after you graduated from college and who are constantly playing with their phones while the teacher is talking and who drink 24-ounce Red Bulls at nine in the morning, it’s really weird. I kept expecting them to ask me to buy them beer (they never did). Well, long story short, I ended up taking three semesters of Spanish this way, and although I certainly did learn something (witness the magnificent and heart-warming semester-ending play in which two of my teenaged classmates and I reimagined the ending to the hit biopic Selena), my Spanish still leaves a whole lot to be desired.

After about 12 hours of flying and sitting around at the Guatemala City airport, my turboprop airplane touched down at the tiny Flores airport, where I was met by Juan Trujillo, a squat, barrel- chested guy who works for a great NGO called Rainforest Alliance, where his official title is non-timber forest products coordinator. Juan is originally from the village of Carmelita (the place we were coming back from when I was trying to do my math), and his career has taken him back and forth from running the nontimber products cooperative in the village to working in the city for the NGO. While I was in Guatemala, Juan worked 12-hour days and drove his truck for what seemed like thousands of miles to help me understand what was going on in his country. Because Juan’s English is about as good as my Spanish, however, he brought along Celeste, a young woman with excellent English whose prior translating job was with a United Nations soldier force in Haiti. There was some trouble getting me to my hotel, as a religious procession for some saint had closed down some of the roads on the island, but before long, I was checked into a decent if a bit grungy place called Hotel Casazul, where I practiced my terrible Spanish with the lady in charge to try to figure out how to access the Wi-Fi system (I failed).

***

The schedule for my three days in Petén was jam-packed with travel to isolated villages and meetings with NGO people, government representatives, and others involved in the palm trade. Over the course of these busy days, I tried to figure out what was really going on with the palms in Guatemala the best I could, but it was not always easy.

Part of the problem was the language—even though my translator was great, speaking (and listening) through her was not the same as speaking directly to the people who were explain- ing things, and much meaning inevitably got lost. I also came with various preconceptions from my reading and just my general background, and some of these preconceptions were difficult to shake.

I gained some key understanding early on, fortunately, over breakfast by the lake with Juan Trujillo and José Román Carrera, a bigwig at the Rainforest Alliance for Central America and the Caribbean. I had simply assumed that the villages I was about to visit were all on privately owned land. In fact, as Carrera explained to me, the villages are all located on land that is owned by the government.

Specifically, the villages are all within the Mayan Biosphere Reserve, a 21,000-square-kilometer government-owned area that was set aside in 1990 to protect the extremely valuable forest resources of northern Guatemala. A government agency known as CONAP manages the area, which is split up into three types of land designations—core zones, the primary ecological sites where nobody is supposed to do anything that would harm the forests; buffer zones, where some farming is allowed; and multiple-use zones, where the government may enter into concession agreements with communities to do certain types of more invasive activities, including harvesting of timber and nontimber products like the palms.

Beginning in the mid-2000s, CONAP entered into concession agreements with at least a dozen community organizations within the multiple-use zones to allow the communities, under very specific terms and with extensive monitoring, to harvest and sell various wood and nonwood products. The arrangement has been incredibly successful. According to Carrera, the rate of deforestation in the community areas is twenty times less than in the rest of the reserve, even than in the core zones, which are supposed to be pristine. This last part took me a while to understand, I have to admit. In the United States, a protected zone like a wilderness area or a national monument is almost guaranteed to be in pretty good shape, ecologically. But in northern Guatemala, the supposedly unspoiled lands are often destroyed by narco-traffickers, who clear huge swaths of land out of the forest and who the government is either unable or unwilling to stop. In the communities, however, where the villagers know that the health of the forest is critical to their own future (and where the government and the NGOs provide them with a lot of help), the forests remain more or less protected.

By this time, I was incredibly eager to actually visit one of these villages, so as soon as the first of about 15 meals of eggs and tortillas and beans I would consume on the trip was finished, we set off for the village of Uaxactun (pronounced kind of like “Washington”). A community of about a thousand people approximately 90 kilometers north of Flores, Uaxactun is located near a set of impressive Mayan ruins (for what it’s worth, the sequel to the original Activision videogame hit Pitfall, known as Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure, was apparently based here). Our group included Juan, Celeste, Jorge Sosa (one of the greatest guys ever), and me. A 30-year forestry veteran who works for the association of forest communities called ACOFOP (Asociación de Comunidades Fore- stales de Petén), Sosa knows the name of every tree, seed, and leaf in the forest and wears a white sombrero at all times. Everyone loves Jorge Sosa, even though they all give him grief about the hat. With his dark features and slight frame and that hat, he looks like somebody out of an old movie, so I surreptitiously tried to take as many pictures of him as I could. I even drew a little sketch of him in my notebook and still entertain plans of painting a portrait of him someday, if I ever start painting again.

The drive to Uaxactun took about three hours, during which time I kept my eyes peeled for jaguars and monkeys and other exotic Guatemalan fauna frolicking in the forest. Sadly, I did not see so much as an interesting spider during my entire trip. We arrived in the village around midday. It was a charming place. The main living area consisted of a series of little houses surrounding a cleared-out rectangular area maybe three football fields long, which had been used as an airstrip at one time. Pigs and horses and dogs ran freely around; kids were playing in the field and looking at me with my pen and little notebook as if I were a weirdo.

I was escorted into a small wooden house, painted green with a tin roof and concrete floor. There I met with four community leaders who explained how palm harvesting had changed in the village over the past ten years. There were three men and a woman. One of the men looked remarkably like a darker version of Burt Reynolds in Cannonball Run, and this distracted me several times during our conversation because I kept expecting Dom DeLuise to show up. The four villagers explained to me how before they entered into a concession agreement with CONAP in the mid-2000s, the xateros (in Guatemala, the palms are called xate and the palm-cutters are called xateros) would cut as many palms as they could as fast as they could, because the buyers paid for the palms solely by quantity. The buyers would pay the xateros very little and then send the palms on to Guatemala City, where an exporter would sell them to overseas distributors. As a result, the xateros were destroying the forests.

Beginning in 2005, however, the village, along with government and NGO forest engineers, developed a management plan that totally changed how the palms were harvested. Now, the community’s forest is divided into four zones. Harvesters are allowed to cut palms in only one of the four zones at a time and only for 30 days, after which they must move to a different zone. Consequently, the palms in each zone get 90 days to recuperate before harvesters return to cut some more. Also, the xateros were trained to cut the palm leaves in a way that benefits the palms. Instead of cutting all of the plant’s leaves, regardless of their quality, the xateros now only cut the leaves that are good enough to be sold overseas. Leaves that have holes, or that are yellowed, or that are otherwise flawed are left alone; they may not be perfect enough to be put into a floral display or carried on Palm Sunday, but they are still very important for the health of the plant and thus the forest and the entire ecosystem.

The community sells the palms directly to an importer in the United States (how this came about is an important part of the story, one that I did not learn about until later on in the week, so stay tuned), and to ensure that the xateros are only cutting the good leaves from the plants, the harvesters must bring the bags of leaves to the bodega de xate, a special building where village women sort through the leaves, note how many of the leaves received from each xatero are good ones, and decide how much each xatero will get paid for his harvest. The part about the women being the ones who run the sorting part of the operation is universal in these sustainably harvesting communities, and it is one of the great benefits of the new approach to palm harvesting. Before these developments, women in the village were often unemployed, but now they participate in the work of the community while also bringing home extra money to help their families.

Once I got the gist of what was going on, I asked about the contribution of the U.S. churches to the village. After all, although I was learning a lot of fascinating stuff about internal Guatemalan conservation efforts, my original goal in studying these changes was to understand whether and how religious groups in the United States have contributed both to the problems and to the solutions here in Latin America. The villagers were extremely positive about their relationship with the EcoPalm project. According to the four people I was meeting with, the churches had given the community a great deal of extra money above and beyond the normal price of the palms. (I had not yet gotten into exact amounts—this was what would end up getting me all flummoxed and doing long division on the way home from Carmelita.) The community has used the money for all sorts of things—not only to keep up its forest man- agement practices and to get those practices certified by Rainforest Alliance (which the government requires), but also for infrastructure and education. In the past, for instance, the villagers used the money to hire teachers for older students and to put a concrete floor into a school so the children wouldn’t have to study on dirt.

Our next stop was the bodega de xate, a long, open warehouse constructed from wooden slats painted turquoise and topped with a tin roof. On the side of the bodega, a group of students had painted a mural depicting the steps of the palm harvesting and selling process—from a xatero cutting the palms in the forest, to a woman selecting the usable palms in the warehouse, to a truck transporting the palms to a refrigerated room in Guatemala City, where they are stored before being sent overseas. Inside the bodega, a dozen wooden tables were covered with palms, some in rough piles, unsorted, just in from the forest, and others in neat stacks of uniform bundles of 20 palms each. Burt Reynolds and some of his friends showed me how they wrap 30 bundles together in brown paper to make a package of 600 fronds—the basic unit in which the palms are exported. An older woman wearing a short blue skirt and a black top explained how she sorts through the just-harvested palms and throws the ones that are too small or misshapen or otherwise flawed on the ground. The woman’s name was Raina Isabel Valenzuela, and she showed me a notebook in which she keeps careful notes about how many bad palms each xatero brings in. She claimed that before the harvesters instituted the new sorting system, nearly 85 percent of the harvested palms were unusable; now, she said, very few are discarded. If the records show that a xatero has been bringing in too many unusable leaves, then the villagers will have a talk with him, because every unusable leaf that is cut from a tree harms the forest without getting anything for the village in return.

Although it would take until the Mexico part of my trip for me to really hike into a forest to see these palms in their natural habitat, we did take a walk to the edge of the forest in Uaxactun, where Jorge Sosa and the guys showed me the different kinds of palms that are grown there. Only the so-called xate jade—a frond of about 18 to 24 inches with maybe 12 or 14 leaves on each frond—are really exported in serious numbers. There are a couple of other types as well, including one called fish tail (cola de piscado), which looks like the tail of a fish, and a narrower palm called the xate hembra. The narrower palm used to sell but now, much to the chagrin of the villagers, has become nearly impossible to export. (At one point, the villagers pulled me over and implored me to convince more of my fellow Americans to import this type of palm—which is what I’m doing here, now, in this sentence.) The villagers also gave me a little primer on how they cut the palms to keep the forest healthy (don’t cut the principal stem, only cut leaves of a certain size) before we had to say our farewells and hit the so-called road back to Flores.

Although my days were filled with activities planned by Juan and the other good folks at Rainforest Alliance, I did get a little time at night to relax by myself. My hotel room had a nice balcony overlooking the lake, so I sat out there as the sun went down, reviewing my notes and drinking a can of Gallo, the national beer whose label sports a squawking rooster. Being a tourist town, Flores has a lot of really good restaurants, so that night, I went to an Italian place with a leafy terrace. I sat down on the far right of a tiny bar with only three stools. While I was drinking another Gallo and waiting for my dinner, a gray cat jumped up onto the far left stool and sat down. I said hello to the cat. The cat ignored me. Then the waiter put a shot glass with a piece of ice in front of the cat, and the cat licked it. I sipped my beer. The cat licked the ice. Together we drank in silence.

***

Juan and I got on the road to Carmelita the next day early enough that when we arrived, the first thing we did was eat breakfast. This is the village where Juan is from, so he knew just whose house to go to for a morning meal. We sat in someone’s outdoor thatched-roof kitchen, chickens wandering around clucking, the radio playing Spanish music (including, unbelievably, “Macarena”) in the background. A wood stove was heating up a metal plate on which was set a large pot of water that we dipped our cups into for instant coffee. The coffee situation was puzzling to me at first. Guatemala is one of the great coffee-producing countries in the world—indeed, when I left on my trip, I had a big bag of Peet’s Guatemalan coffee in my cabinet at home—but all of the coffee I had been served since arriving was instant or otherwise not too good. Somebody explained the obvious to me later on in the trip—the people who harvest the coffee are poor, so they need to sell the best coffee to big companies that can sell the coffee to people like me in the United States, who will buy it for three dollars a cup, which means that the coffee that’s left in Guatemala for the coffee harvesters to drink is fairly terrible. But the eggs and beans and tortillas that Juan’s friend cooked up for us on the outdoor wood stove were definitely delicious. While we ate, Jorge and Juan chatted about their many grandchildren and how hard it can be to get kids to stop looking at some kind of screen, which is something I think about all the time when I’m back at home. Carmelita is a bit smaller and farther out than Uaxactun, but it was otherwise quite similar. As in Uaxactun, we started by meeting the village leaders to discuss their new harvesting techniques (which are much the same as in the previous village) and what they purchased with the extra money donated by the churches (not just education, but health benefits, life insurance, fire protection, and even coffins). Then we hit the bodega de xate. It was here that I started confusing myself with numbers and math. I had realized by this second day in Guatemala that my original notion of the relationship between the EcoPalm project and the development of sustainable harvesting practices was not correct. The EcoPalm project itself was not, as I had originally assumed, the cause of these sustainable practices. Instead, the villagers (with help from the government and NGOs) had developed the sustainable practices independently, and then the churches in the United States basically decided to invest in the villages by agreeing to buy palms from the Guatemalans for a premium. But how much of an investment were we talking? Have the churches been a major player in supporting these villages, or did religion just have a bit part?

I asked the woman who was showing me around the bodega how many more palms the villagers sell around Palm Sunday than they sell during the rest of the year. She told me they tend to sell about 200 extra packages during those weeks. At 600 palm fronds per package, that’s an additional 120,000 palms for the holiday. Each package costs, on average, about $12. So far, so good. But when I asked how much the churches paid as a premium, I thought she said that the churches pay an additional sustainability bonus of five cents for every dollar that they pay in total for the palms. Now, I have never been all that good in math, so I couldn’t really process the numbers in my head, but I started to think that maybe we weren’t talking about that much money. This concern was nagging at me while Celeste, Juan, Jorge, and I were eating lunch on the patio of one of the villagers’ homes. As I nibbled at a chicken leg served in a bowl of soup with rice and potatoes and worried about whether the red Kool-Aid that I was drinking from a small plastic glass with a smiling cow on it was made with purified water, I started to wonder whether I had come all this way to Central America to research a program that was donating but a piddling amount to the sustainability of this critical ecosystem.

And so that’s why I was trying to do some basic math in Juan’s truck as the four of us—Juan and I up front and Jorge and Celeste in the backseat—bounced our way out of Carmelita and back toward Flores. It was a strange ride for other reasons, too. As usual, dogs and turkeys and pigs were all over the road; several chickens crossed the road, seemingly, truly, just to get to the other side. At several points, Juan pulled over to pick up random people to give them a lift in the flatbed. I guess this is just the custom where we were, although I was a little worried about the six- or seven-year-old kid who must have been flying around the flatbed as the truck jumped over the road’s bumps and grooves. Apparently, Guatemala doesn’t have the same laws that we do in the United States—that is, laws that require kids to sit in car seats until they’re old enough to get a learner’s permit.

Anyway, according to my calculations, if the churches paid 12 bucks per package for 200 packages and paid an extra five cents per dollar, then the sum total contribution of the churches to the Carmelita community was about $120 per year (0.05 x 12 x 200). I did this calculation three times and then fell into despair. I knew the village was pretty poor, but seriously, how many pencils, pens, and coffins could $120 actually buy? Luckily, at this point I decided to check my understanding with Juan and Jorge. It took a while for me to explain myself, for everyone to be sure that the translation was accurate (translating mathematical relations and equations is no easy matter), and for Juan and Jorge to understand that I was totally off base. But ultimately they assured me that the churches paid five cents extra per frond, not five cents extra per dollar otherwise spent. In other words, instead of paying about 12 bucks per package, the churches paid about $42 for every package, or about a total of $6,000 extra per year (0.05 x 600 x 200). I can’t tell you how relieved this made me; with four communities in Petén selling nearly equal amounts of palms to the U.S. churches, this means that the churches are contributing something like $25,000 extra per year to the Guatemalan forests, which, as the economists will tell you, is not chump change (and this amount doesn’t even include the money donated to Mexican villages).

The road we were driving on—and I use the word road here with some hesitation—was simply a deeply grooved dirt trail that had been coarsely etched through the jungle so that trucks like this one could travel between the town of Flores, a lovely little place overrun by tourists on an island in the middle of a scenic lake, and the many tiny villages and Mayan ruins that dot the northern jungles. Rains had turned parts of the road into muddy mush, and the trip was about as smooth as the swirling teacup ride at Disneyland. I was being jarred in all directions, my head occasionally thumping up against the roof of the truck, as I tried to do some basic fourth-grade mathematical calculations using the numbers that I had written down in my little notebook at the village we’d just departed.

In that village—it’s called Carmelita—as in several other villages in the northern Guatemalan region of Petén, farmers make a modest living by selling products harvested from the forest itself. These include both wood products and nonwood products like pepper, a tree gum called chicle that is used to make chewing gum, and ramón, a seed that apparently the Mayans munched on while constructing their intricate temples and that the Guatemalan chamber of commerce would like to market as the next international superfood of the 21st century. The farmers also tend to various types of palm trees. Not the tall, swaying, tropical, coconut-bearing palm trees of Southern California or Miami Beach, but squat little plants and bushes that sit in the shade of the forest and whose leaves are harvested and sent overseas to be used in floral arrangements and carried aloft by celebrants during the spring holiday of Palm Sunday.

Palm Sunday is a Christian holiday that falls on the Sunday before Easter and commemorates the day that Jesus Christ entered the holy city of Jerusalem while crowds of admirers laid down palm leaves on the ground before him.

Like most people, before I started working on this book, I had never considered for a second where the palm leaves used every year for this holiday actually come from. It turns out they come from a handful of Latin American countries, including Guatemala, Belize, and Mexico, and it also turns out that for the most part they are harvested in a haphazard fashion without any regard to the long-term sustainability of the forests. There are, however, some exceptions.

In a few select villages in northern Guatemala and the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, local farmers—with the help of savvy non-governmental environmental organizations, forward-looking governmental agencies, and a conglomeration of religious organizations in the United States that have come together under the leadership of an unassuming University of Minnesota professor to form the so-called “Eco Palm” project— have revolutionized the way that palm leaves are harvested in the region.

In February 2012, I spent a week in Guatemala and Mexico to learn about these harvesting techniques so I could understand what role religious groups have played in both creating and solving the problem of palm deforestation. But why was I furiously doing long division in the front seat of a pickup truck tromping through the Guatemalan jungle? We’ll get to that.

***

I first learned about the potentially deleterious effects of Palm Sunday on Latin American forests when a colleague pointed me to a fascinating article about a Colombian bird published in Audubon magazine. In the piece, a terrific freelance writer named Susan McGrath tells the story of the yellow-eared parrot, a glorious creature, mostly bright green with yellow patches on the side of its head, that lives in a small area in the Andes Mountains of Colombia. The yellow-eared parrot is highly sensitive and can only nest in a single type of wax palm tree. Unfortunately for these feathered fellows, however, the local church in the region where the birds live had been using this tree’s leaves for its annual Palm Sunday celebration, thus decimating the tree population and driving the parrot to the brink of extinction. When the bird’s defenders first tried to convince the town’s priest to use a different type of palm, they were not well received. Specifically, according to McGrath, the priest “blew a gasket” and “admonished parishioners to stand fast and keep using the palms.” It was only when the priest was transferred and replaced by a more flexible religious leader that the bird lovers started to make progress. In the end, the church replaced the wax palm leaves with an abundant native species called iraca (which some still oppose because it is too “puny”), and as a result the birds have made a re- markable recovery.

The Eco Palm project that I mentioned earlier is another super-awesome effort to protect the unique environment where Palm Sunday palms grow. It can circuitously be traced back to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the 1994 accord between the United States, Canada, and Mexico that eliminated tariffs and other impediments to free trade among the three countries. One argument that free trade opponents often raise is that lifting barriers to trade can sometimes harm the environment. An importing country that cares a lot about the environment, for example, cannot always insist that an exporting country do things in an environmentally friendly way as a condition on importing the exporter’s goods.

An example of this problem occurred in the mid-’90s, when the United States insisted that it would only import shrimp caught in nets with a turtle-excluding device that would prevent shrimpers from inadvertently ensnaring and killing endangered sea turtles. This requirement was fine for big, rich Western shrimpers, but for poor independent shrimpers in places like Malaysia and Pakistan, installing these turtle excluding devices was completely unfeasible (the shrimpers’ yearly income in some cases was about the same amount as the cost of one device). These small shrimpers brought a high-profile case against the United States in front of the World Trade Organization, which ultimately held for the United States, but not without placing some limits on our ability to insist on environmentally friendly processes as a precondition to importing foreign goods.

Some environmentalists were really angry about this. If you remember back to 1999, when a loose and weird coalition of unions and environmental groups and anarchists (an- archists!) protested the WTO’s Seattle conference and caused all sorts of property damage—some called these events the Battle of Seattle—you might recall that a bunch of the protestors were dressed up as turtles. This is why.

Anyway, due to these concerns about free trade, the three NAFTA countries established an organization called the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to study NAFTA’s environmental effects and to take steps to mitigate them. Sometime in the late ’90s, the head of the Trade and Environment Program at CEC, a woman named Chantal Line-Carpentier, became aware that palm forests in southern Mexico were being harmed by unsustainable harvesting techniques. Line-Carpentier knew that consumers in the United States are often willing to pay a premium for products they know are helping (or at least not hurting) the environment. She had previously worked on projects to harness private market demand as a way of promoting sustainably grown coffee, and she wondered whether the same approach might help the palms.

In 2000, she contacted Dean Current, a forestry economist at the University of Minnesota who had a great deal of experience with Latin American forests, and asked him if he would conduct a study to figure out whether such a thing might be possible.

At first, Current was skeptical about doing the study. As he told me when we met in his office in the University of Minnesota’s Soil Science Building in St. Paul, he is trained as an economist, not a marketer. But he eventually agreed, and along with a graduate student, he not only visited and talked to all the wholesale florists in the Twin Cities but also did a nationwide study of the entire palm importing business in the United States. He learned that although most of the demand for palms from Latin America comes from florists who use the palms as part of floral displays, churches that buy palms for Palm Sunday also make up a significant portion of the market. Plus, many of these churches seemed to be quite willing to pay a little extra for palms that were sustainably harvested, if the churches were guaranteed that the additional money would go back to the communities to support sustainable practices and other important community needs, such as education. As Current put it when I asked him if any churches refused to participate in his program, “No one says that they don’t want to pay twenty more dollars for sustainability.” And thus, the EcoPalm project was born.

The project started small. In 2005, its pilot year, Current and a graduate student took orders themselves from religious congregations in Minnesota and North Dakota and delivered a total of about five thousand palm fronds to the churches from the back of a van. Over time, however, the project grew substantially. Current brought in religious organizations like Lutheran World Relief and the Episcopal Church to spread the word to their congregations, and he had a professional florist take care of the sales and deliveries. Media stories, like one published in the New York Times in 2007, brought the project added publicity. By 2012, the project filled orders for over nine hundred thousand fronds. This was still a relatively small percentage of the palms that are used in Palm Sunday services around the country, but it marked a great advance over the situation just a few years earlier, and it meant that a good deal of money was being sent to communities in need.

It was clear from what I had read about the EcoPalm project and talking to Professor Current that I had happened upon a very cool initiative that was providing real benefits to the environment. But I still had a lot of questions. What were these harvesting techniques that the villagers were using to protect the palm forests? What do palm forests even look like? Do the villagers know who was buying their palms, and why? Most importantly, how did these select villages in Guatemala and Mexico happen to develop sustainable harvesting techniques? Did the EcoPalm project, with its promise of paying extra for sustainably harvested palms, create the incen- tive to start harvesting the palms in a sustainable fashion, or were the palms already being harvested sustainably in some places? Reading the newspaper articles about the project, I believed that the EcoPalm project itself had created the incentives. The New York Times piece, for instance, suggested that the primary consumers of the sustainably harvested palms were indeed the churches. Was religion really that important of a factor here, either in creating or solving the palm forest crisis in Latin America? I wanted to learn more. And so I traveled south.

***

In 2013, I left for Guatemala in mid-February, which is a good time to leave for Guatemala if you live in Boston, where just the week before, we had received 23 inches of snow during a single storm. I had never been to Central America, so I was a little worried about the things that people who have never actually gone to Central America tend to be worried about when they go to Central America, like whether it was safe. The assistant dean who approved my funding for the trip didn’t exactly put me at ease when he told me there was “no money in the ransom budget, so be careful.” As it turned out, though, I had no use for such funds. The trip went as smooth as can be.

One thing that made my research in Guatemala and Mexico more difficult than it needed to be was my poor language skills. My Spanish is muy crappy. I should have taken Spanish in high school, but instead I took Latin, I guess because I thought it was more important to be able to talk with the pope than with the 350 million or so people who speak Spanish all over the world.

Anyway, a couple of years before I took this trip, for reasons I won’t get into, I decided to start studying Spanish. My university has a great perk that allows faculty members to take courses in other parts of the school for free. So one summer, I enrolled in Introduction to Spanish, along with 15 19 year olds. Let me tell you, when you’re an old guy and you take a class with a bunch of kids who were born after you graduated from college and who are constantly playing with their phones while the teacher is talking and who drink 24-ounce Red Bulls at nine in the morning, it’s really weird. I kept expecting them to ask me to buy them beer (they never did). Well, long story short, I ended up taking three semesters of Spanish this way, and although I certainly did learn something (witness the magnificent and heart-warming semester-ending play in which two of my teenaged classmates and I reimagined the ending to the hit biopic Selena), my Spanish still leaves a whole lot to be desired.

After about 12 hours of flying and sitting around at the Guatemala City airport, my turboprop airplane touched down at the tiny Flores airport, where I was met by Juan Trujillo, a squat, barrel- chested guy who works for a great NGO called Rainforest Alliance, where his official title is non-timber forest products coordinator. Juan is originally from the village of Carmelita (the place we were coming back from when I was trying to do my math), and his career has taken him back and forth from running the nontimber products cooperative in the village to working in the city for the NGO. While I was in Guatemala, Juan worked 12-hour days and drove his truck for what seemed like thousands of miles to help me understand what was going on in his country. Because Juan’s English is about as good as my Spanish, however, he brought along Celeste, a young woman with excellent English whose prior translating job was with a United Nations soldier force in Haiti. There was some trouble getting me to my hotel, as a religious procession for some saint had closed down some of the roads on the island, but before long, I was checked into a decent if a bit grungy place called Hotel Casazul, where I practiced my terrible Spanish with the lady in charge to try to figure out how to access the Wi-Fi system (I failed).

***

The schedule for my three days in Petén was jam-packed with travel to isolated villages and meetings with NGO people, government representatives, and others involved in the palm trade. Over the course of these busy days, I tried to figure out what was really going on with the palms in Guatemala the best I could, but it was not always easy.

Part of the problem was the language—even though my translator was great, speaking (and listening) through her was not the same as speaking directly to the people who were explain- ing things, and much meaning inevitably got lost. I also came with various preconceptions from my reading and just my general background, and some of these preconceptions were difficult to shake.

I gained some key understanding early on, fortunately, over breakfast by the lake with Juan Trujillo and José Román Carrera, a bigwig at the Rainforest Alliance for Central America and the Caribbean. I had simply assumed that the villages I was about to visit were all on privately owned land. In fact, as Carrera explained to me, the villages are all located on land that is owned by the government.

Specifically, the villages are all within the Mayan Biosphere Reserve, a 21,000-square-kilometer government-owned area that was set aside in 1990 to protect the extremely valuable forest resources of northern Guatemala. A government agency known as CONAP manages the area, which is split up into three types of land designations—core zones, the primary ecological sites where nobody is supposed to do anything that would harm the forests; buffer zones, where some farming is allowed; and multiple-use zones, where the government may enter into concession agreements with communities to do certain types of more invasive activities, including harvesting of timber and nontimber products like the palms.

Beginning in the mid-2000s, CONAP entered into concession agreements with at least a dozen community organizations within the multiple-use zones to allow the communities, under very specific terms and with extensive monitoring, to harvest and sell various wood and nonwood products. The arrangement has been incredibly successful. According to Carrera, the rate of deforestation in the community areas is twenty times less than in the rest of the reserve, even than in the core zones, which are supposed to be pristine. This last part took me a while to understand, I have to admit. In the United States, a protected zone like a wilderness area or a national monument is almost guaranteed to be in pretty good shape, ecologically. But in northern Guatemala, the supposedly unspoiled lands are often destroyed by narco-traffickers, who clear huge swaths of land out of the forest and who the government is either unable or unwilling to stop. In the communities, however, where the villagers know that the health of the forest is critical to their own future (and where the government and the NGOs provide them with a lot of help), the forests remain more or less protected.

By this time, I was incredibly eager to actually visit one of these villages, so as soon as the first of about 15 meals of eggs and tortillas and beans I would consume on the trip was finished, we set off for the village of Uaxactun (pronounced kind of like “Washington”). A community of about a thousand people approximately 90 kilometers north of Flores, Uaxactun is located near a set of impressive Mayan ruins (for what it’s worth, the sequel to the original Activision videogame hit Pitfall, known as Pitfall: The Mayan Adventure, was apparently based here). Our group included Juan, Celeste, Jorge Sosa (one of the greatest guys ever), and me. A 30-year forestry veteran who works for the association of forest communities called ACOFOP (Asociación de Comunidades Fore- stales de Petén), Sosa knows the name of every tree, seed, and leaf in the forest and wears a white sombrero at all times. Everyone loves Jorge Sosa, even though they all give him grief about the hat. With his dark features and slight frame and that hat, he looks like somebody out of an old movie, so I surreptitiously tried to take as many pictures of him as I could. I even drew a little sketch of him in my notebook and still entertain plans of painting a portrait of him someday, if I ever start painting again.

The drive to Uaxactun took about three hours, during which time I kept my eyes peeled for jaguars and monkeys and other exotic Guatemalan fauna frolicking in the forest. Sadly, I did not see so much as an interesting spider during my entire trip. We arrived in the village around midday. It was a charming place. The main living area consisted of a series of little houses surrounding a cleared-out rectangular area maybe three football fields long, which had been used as an airstrip at one time. Pigs and horses and dogs ran freely around; kids were playing in the field and looking at me with my pen and little notebook as if I were a weirdo.

I was escorted into a small wooden house, painted green with a tin roof and concrete floor. There I met with four community leaders who explained how palm harvesting had changed in the village over the past ten years. There were three men and a woman. One of the men looked remarkably like a darker version of Burt Reynolds in Cannonball Run, and this distracted me several times during our conversation because I kept expecting Dom DeLuise to show up. The four villagers explained to me how before they entered into a concession agreement with CONAP in the mid-2000s, the xateros (in Guatemala, the palms are called xate and the palm-cutters are called xateros) would cut as many palms as they could as fast as they could, because the buyers paid for the palms solely by quantity. The buyers would pay the xateros very little and then send the palms on to Guatemala City, where an exporter would sell them to overseas distributors. As a result, the xateros were destroying the forests.

Beginning in 2005, however, the village, along with government and NGO forest engineers, developed a management plan that totally changed how the palms were harvested. Now, the community’s forest is divided into four zones. Harvesters are allowed to cut palms in only one of the four zones at a time and only for 30 days, after which they must move to a different zone. Consequently, the palms in each zone get 90 days to recuperate before harvesters return to cut some more. Also, the xateros were trained to cut the palm leaves in a way that benefits the palms. Instead of cutting all of the plant’s leaves, regardless of their quality, the xateros now only cut the leaves that are good enough to be sold overseas. Leaves that have holes, or that are yellowed, or that are otherwise flawed are left alone; they may not be perfect enough to be put into a floral display or carried on Palm Sunday, but they are still very important for the health of the plant and thus the forest and the entire ecosystem.

The community sells the palms directly to an importer in the United States (how this came about is an important part of the story, one that I did not learn about until later on in the week, so stay tuned), and to ensure that the xateros are only cutting the good leaves from the plants, the harvesters must bring the bags of leaves to the bodega de xate, a special building where village women sort through the leaves, note how many of the leaves received from each xatero are good ones, and decide how much each xatero will get paid for his harvest. The part about the women being the ones who run the sorting part of the operation is universal in these sustainably harvesting communities, and it is one of the great benefits of the new approach to palm harvesting. Before these developments, women in the village were often unemployed, but now they participate in the work of the community while also bringing home extra money to help their families.

Once I got the gist of what was going on, I asked about the contribution of the U.S. churches to the village. After all, although I was learning a lot of fascinating stuff about internal Guatemalan conservation efforts, my original goal in studying these changes was to understand whether and how religious groups in the United States have contributed both to the problems and to the solutions here in Latin America. The villagers were extremely positive about their relationship with the EcoPalm project. According to the four people I was meeting with, the churches had given the community a great deal of extra money above and beyond the normal price of the palms. (I had not yet gotten into exact amounts—this was what would end up getting me all flummoxed and doing long division on the way home from Carmelita.) The community has used the money for all sorts of things—not only to keep up its forest man- agement practices and to get those practices certified by Rainforest Alliance (which the government requires), but also for infrastructure and education. In the past, for instance, the villagers used the money to hire teachers for older students and to put a concrete floor into a school so the children wouldn’t have to study on dirt.

Our next stop was the bodega de xate, a long, open warehouse constructed from wooden slats painted turquoise and topped with a tin roof. On the side of the bodega, a group of students had painted a mural depicting the steps of the palm harvesting and selling process—from a xatero cutting the palms in the forest, to a woman selecting the usable palms in the warehouse, to a truck transporting the palms to a refrigerated room in Guatemala City, where they are stored before being sent overseas. Inside the bodega, a dozen wooden tables were covered with palms, some in rough piles, unsorted, just in from the forest, and others in neat stacks of uniform bundles of 20 palms each. Burt Reynolds and some of his friends showed me how they wrap 30 bundles together in brown paper to make a package of 600 fronds—the basic unit in which the palms are exported. An older woman wearing a short blue skirt and a black top explained how she sorts through the just-harvested palms and throws the ones that are too small or misshapen or otherwise flawed on the ground. The woman’s name was Raina Isabel Valenzuela, and she showed me a notebook in which she keeps careful notes about how many bad palms each xatero brings in. She claimed that before the harvesters instituted the new sorting system, nearly 85 percent of the harvested palms were unusable; now, she said, very few are discarded. If the records show that a xatero has been bringing in too many unusable leaves, then the villagers will have a talk with him, because every unusable leaf that is cut from a tree harms the forest without getting anything for the village in return.

Although it would take until the Mexico part of my trip for me to really hike into a forest to see these palms in their natural habitat, we did take a walk to the edge of the forest in Uaxactun, where Jorge Sosa and the guys showed me the different kinds of palms that are grown there. Only the so-called xate jade—a frond of about 18 to 24 inches with maybe 12 or 14 leaves on each frond—are really exported in serious numbers. There are a couple of other types as well, including one called fish tail (cola de piscado), which looks like the tail of a fish, and a narrower palm called the xate hembra. The narrower palm used to sell but now, much to the chagrin of the villagers, has become nearly impossible to export. (At one point, the villagers pulled me over and implored me to convince more of my fellow Americans to import this type of palm—which is what I’m doing here, now, in this sentence.) The villagers also gave me a little primer on how they cut the palms to keep the forest healthy (don’t cut the principal stem, only cut leaves of a certain size) before we had to say our farewells and hit the so-called road back to Flores.

Although my days were filled with activities planned by Juan and the other good folks at Rainforest Alliance, I did get a little time at night to relax by myself. My hotel room had a nice balcony overlooking the lake, so I sat out there as the sun went down, reviewing my notes and drinking a can of Gallo, the national beer whose label sports a squawking rooster. Being a tourist town, Flores has a lot of really good restaurants, so that night, I went to an Italian place with a leafy terrace. I sat down on the far right of a tiny bar with only three stools. While I was drinking another Gallo and waiting for my dinner, a gray cat jumped up onto the far left stool and sat down. I said hello to the cat. The cat ignored me. Then the waiter put a shot glass with a piece of ice in front of the cat, and the cat licked it. I sipped my beer. The cat licked the ice. Together we drank in silence.

***

Juan and I got on the road to Carmelita the next day early enough that when we arrived, the first thing we did was eat breakfast. This is the village where Juan is from, so he knew just whose house to go to for a morning meal. We sat in someone’s outdoor thatched-roof kitchen, chickens wandering around clucking, the radio playing Spanish music (including, unbelievably, “Macarena”) in the background. A wood stove was heating up a metal plate on which was set a large pot of water that we dipped our cups into for instant coffee. The coffee situation was puzzling to me at first. Guatemala is one of the great coffee-producing countries in the world—indeed, when I left on my trip, I had a big bag of Peet’s Guatemalan coffee in my cabinet at home—but all of the coffee I had been served since arriving was instant or otherwise not too good. Somebody explained the obvious to me later on in the trip—the people who harvest the coffee are poor, so they need to sell the best coffee to big companies that can sell the coffee to people like me in the United States, who will buy it for three dollars a cup, which means that the coffee that’s left in Guatemala for the coffee harvesters to drink is fairly terrible. But the eggs and beans and tortillas that Juan’s friend cooked up for us on the outdoor wood stove were definitely delicious. While we ate, Jorge and Juan chatted about their many grandchildren and how hard it can be to get kids to stop looking at some kind of screen, which is something I think about all the time when I’m back at home. Carmelita is a bit smaller and farther out than Uaxactun, but it was otherwise quite similar. As in Uaxactun, we started by meeting the village leaders to discuss their new harvesting techniques (which are much the same as in the previous village) and what they purchased with the extra money donated by the churches (not just education, but health benefits, life insurance, fire protection, and even coffins). Then we hit the bodega de xate. It was here that I started confusing myself with numbers and math. I had realized by this second day in Guatemala that my original notion of the relationship between the EcoPalm project and the development of sustainable harvesting practices was not correct. The EcoPalm project itself was not, as I had originally assumed, the cause of these sustainable practices. Instead, the villagers (with help from the government and NGOs) had developed the sustainable practices independently, and then the churches in the United States basically decided to invest in the villages by agreeing to buy palms from the Guatemalans for a premium. But how much of an investment were we talking? Have the churches been a major player in supporting these villages, or did religion just have a bit part?

I asked the woman who was showing me around the bodega how many more palms the villagers sell around Palm Sunday than they sell during the rest of the year. She told me they tend to sell about 200 extra packages during those weeks. At 600 palm fronds per package, that’s an additional 120,000 palms for the holiday. Each package costs, on average, about $12. So far, so good. But when I asked how much the churches paid as a premium, I thought she said that the churches pay an additional sustainability bonus of five cents for every dollar that they pay in total for the palms. Now, I have never been all that good in math, so I couldn’t really process the numbers in my head, but I started to think that maybe we weren’t talking about that much money. This concern was nagging at me while Celeste, Juan, Jorge, and I were eating lunch on the patio of one of the villagers’ homes. As I nibbled at a chicken leg served in a bowl of soup with rice and potatoes and worried about whether the red Kool-Aid that I was drinking from a small plastic glass with a smiling cow on it was made with purified water, I started to wonder whether I had come all this way to Central America to research a program that was donating but a piddling amount to the sustainability of this critical ecosystem.

And so that’s why I was trying to do some basic math in Juan’s truck as the four of us—Juan and I up front and Jorge and Celeste in the backseat—bounced our way out of Carmelita and back toward Flores. It was a strange ride for other reasons, too. As usual, dogs and turkeys and pigs were all over the road; several chickens crossed the road, seemingly, truly, just to get to the other side. At several points, Juan pulled over to pick up random people to give them a lift in the flatbed. I guess this is just the custom where we were, although I was a little worried about the six- or seven-year-old kid who must have been flying around the flatbed as the truck jumped over the road’s bumps and grooves. Apparently, Guatemala doesn’t have the same laws that we do in the United States—that is, laws that require kids to sit in car seats until they’re old enough to get a learner’s permit.

Anyway, according to my calculations, if the churches paid 12 bucks per package for 200 packages and paid an extra five cents per dollar, then the sum total contribution of the churches to the Carmelita community was about $120 per year (0.05 x 12 x 200). I did this calculation three times and then fell into despair. I knew the village was pretty poor, but seriously, how many pencils, pens, and coffins could $120 actually buy? Luckily, at this point I decided to check my understanding with Juan and Jorge. It took a while for me to explain myself, for everyone to be sure that the translation was accurate (translating mathematical relations and equations is no easy matter), and for Juan and Jorge to understand that I was totally off base. But ultimately they assured me that the churches paid five cents extra per frond, not five cents extra per dollar otherwise spent. In other words, instead of paying about 12 bucks per package, the churches paid about $42 for every package, or about a total of $6,000 extra per year (0.05 x 600 x 200). I can’t tell you how relieved this made me; with four communities in Petén selling nearly equal amounts of palms to the U.S. churches, this means that the churches are contributing something like $25,000 extra per year to the Guatemalan forests, which, as the economists will tell you, is not chump change (and this amount doesn’t even include the money donated to Mexican villages).

0,"Juan F Masello, a principal investigator in animal ecology and systematics at Justus Liebig University in Germany, is one of a small but unabashedly enthusiastic circle of researchers who study Psittaciformes, the avian order that includes parrots, parakeets, macaws and cockatoos. For all their visual splash and cartoon familiarity, parrots have long been given scientific short shrift in favour of more amenable subjects like, say, zebra finches or blue tits.





But through a mix of rugged and sometimes risky field work, laboratory studies and a willingness to shrug off the frequent loss of expensive tracking equipment,

researchers are gaining insights into the lives, minds and startling appetites of

parrots.



Feathered primates

Parrot partisans say the birds easily rival the great apes and dolphins in all-around braininess and resourcefulness, and may be the only animals apart from humans capable of dancing to the beat. “We call them feathered primates,” said Irene Pepperberg, who studies animal cognition at Harvard and is renowned for her research with Alex and other African grey parrots. “They’re very good colleagues,” said Alice Auersperg of the University of Vienna, who studies the Goffin’s cockatoo of Indonesia.



Many of the recent discoveries are described in a new book, Parrots of the Wild: A Natural History of the World’s Most Captivating Birds, by Catherine A Toft and Timothy F Wright. Alice and her colleagues have found that Goffin’s cockatoos are among the most spontaneously inventive toolmakers ever described, and that the birds can learn how to fashion the latest food-fetching device after just a single viewing of a master cockatoo at work.



Studying the yellow-naped amazon (parrot) of Costa Rica, Timothy and his colleagues have discovered that different populations of the parrot communicate with one another in distinct dialects that remain stable over decades, like human languages. Just as with people, young parrots can easily master multiple dialects while their elders can’t or won’t bother to do likewise.



A recent DNA analysis showed that parrots were closely related to falcons, a finding that dovetails with field studies of parrots’ often merciless dietary habits. While falcons are predators in the conventional sense, hunting and devouring other animals, parrots turn out to be no less bloodthirsty in their approach to feasting on plants.



Parrots pooh-pooh the fruit pulp and home in on the seeds, crushing the casings to extract the plant embryos and the cache of fats and proteins intended to help those embryos germinate. “A parrot is a plant carnivore,” Timothy said. “It destroys the seed. It goes right in through the fruit and eats the plant baby.”



Flexible and impervious

The Psittacines are a mid-size club of about 360 species, ranging in size from the pygmy parrots of New Guinea, which are smaller than house sparrows, to the bulky, flightless kakapos of New Zealand, which can weigh up to nine pounds.



The parrot’s muscular jaw and huge bill — specially hinged to allow top and bottom to move independently, up and down and from side to side — can crack open even the toughest and woodiest shells. The curved points of the bill act rather like lobster picks, ideal for scooping out seed meat. Parrots can similarly clip apart leg bands, satellite holsters and other animal-tracking devices, which is one reason most researchers have avoided them.



Another demand of granivory, or seed predation, is the power to withstand the many defensive chemicals that plants pack into their genetic hope chests. Researchers have lately gathered evidence that a drive to detoxify could explain why parrots often converge on clay flats and start nibbling at the ground.



Gift of gab

Yet seed hunting’s greatest evolutionary effect on parrothood may well have been psychosocial, transforming the birds into brainy schmoozers. Fruiting trees are a patchy and unpredictable resource, and parrots often fly many miles a day in quest of food.



Under such circumstances, searching in groups turns out to be more efficient than solitary hunting, especially when group members can trade tips on promising leads.



“That can mean the development of a social system, as well as the neurological capacity to share information,” a researcher said. The vocal capacity, too: parrots call to one another continually, squawkishly, over long distances and short. “They are communicating to each other all the time,” Juan said. The calls may be as much about asserting group identity as exchanging hunting tips. Seeking to understand why the yellow-naped Amazons in northern Costa Rica had a different call from those living 18 miles to the south, Timothy’s team tried moving several parrots from one site to the other.



The youngest parrot quickly mastered the dialect of its new home and began flocking with the locals. The older transplants, however, failed to become adept bilingualists and never quite fit in. Instead, they associated with each other. “They formed a little immigrant enclave,” Timothy said, adding, “Vocal similarity is very important for maintaining social relationships,” in parrots as in humans.



Always trying something new

Researchers are still getting a bead on parrot intelligence, and they are repeatedly surprised by each new display of it. Irene and her collaborators have shown that African grey parrots have exceptional number skills: Alex could deduce the proper order of numbers up to eight, add three small numbers together and even had a zero-like concept — “skills equivalent to those of a 41⁄2-year-old child,” Irene said.



Alice and her co-workers have found that Goffin’s cockatoos are more geared toward solving technical tasks. Alternately using their bills and feet, the birds can systematically make their way through a lock with five different complex mechanisms on it. Should they discover that one of the steps can be skipped en route to opening a chamber with a nut inside, they skip it the next time around.



And in an act of ingenuity that Alice called “sensational” for an animal not known to use tools in the wild, a cockatoo named Figaro one day started carefully chipping at the edge of a larch wood frame until he had formed a long, slender pole, which he then wielded in his bill like a hockey stick to knock out pebbles and nuts hidden under boxes.



“It took him 20 minutes to make his first tool,” Alice said. “After that, he could do it in less than five minutes.” Other cockatoos that watched Figaro build his tool and then retrieve his nut reward were soon chipping at scraps of wood and batting out nuts. Figaro didn’t stop there. Soon he was using sticks to draw patterns in the sand, Alice said.

For all their visual splash and cartoon familiarity, parrots have long been given scientific short shrift in favour of more amenable subjects like, say, zebra finches or blue tits.





But through a mix of rugged and sometimes risky field work, laboratory studies and a willingness to shrug off the frequent loss of expensive tracking equipment,

researchers are gaining insights into the lives, minds and startling appetites of

parrots.



Feathered primates

Parrot partisans say the birds easily rival the great apes and dolphins in all-around braininess and resourcefulness, and may be the only animals apart from humans capable of dancing to the beat. “We call them feathered primates,” said Irene Pepperberg, who studies animal cognition at Harvard and is renowned for her research with Alex and other African grey parrots. “They’re very good colleagues,” said Alice Auersperg of the University of Vienna, who studies the Goffin’s cockatoo of Indonesia.



Many of the recent discoveries are described in a new book, Parrots of the Wild: A Natural History of the World’s Most Captivating Birds, by Catherine A Toft and Timothy F Wright. Alice and her colleagues have found that Goffin’s cockatoos are among the most spontaneously inventive toolmakers ever described, and that the birds can learn how to fashion the latest food-fetching device after just a single viewing of a master cockatoo at work.



Studying the yellow-naped amazon (parrot) of Costa Rica, Timothy and his colleagues have discovered that different populations of the parrot communicate with one another in distinct dialects that remain stable over decades, like human languages. Just as with people, young parrots can easily master multiple dialects while their elders can’t or won’t bother to do likewise.



A recent DNA analysis showed that parrots were closely related to falcons, a finding that dovetails with field studies of parrots’ often merciless dietary habits. While falcons are predators in the conventional sense, hunting and devouring other animals, parrots turn out to be no less bloodthirsty in their approach to feasting on plants.



Parrots pooh-pooh the fruit pulp and home in on the seeds, crushing the casings to extract the plant embryos and the cache of fats and proteins intended to help those embryos germinate. “A parrot is a plant carnivore,” Timothy said. “It destroys the seed. It goes right in through the fruit and eats the plant baby.”



Flexible and impervious

The Psittacines are a mid-size club of about 360 species, ranging in size from the pygmy parrots of New Guinea, which are smaller than house sparrows, to the bulky, flightless kakapos of New Zealand, which can weigh up to nine pounds.



The parrot’s muscular jaw and huge bill — specially hinged to allow top and bottom to move independently, up and down and from side to side — can crack open even the toughest and woodiest shells. The curved points of the bill act rather like lobster picks, ideal for scooping out seed meat. Parrots can similarly clip apart leg bands, satellite holsters and other animal-tracking devices, which is one reason most researchers have avoided them.



Another demand of granivory, or seed predation, is the power to withstand the many defensive chemicals that plants pack into their genetic hope chests. Researchers have lately gathered evidence that a drive to detoxify could explain why parrots often converge on clay flats and start nibbling at the ground.



Gift of gab

Yet seed hunting’s greatest evolutionary effect on parrothood may well have been psychosocial, transforming the birds into brainy schmoozers. Fruiting trees are a patchy and unpredictable resource, and parrots often fly many miles a day in quest of food.



Under such circumstances, searching in groups turns out to be more efficient than solitary hunting, especially when group members can trade tips on promising leads.



“That can mean the development of a social system, as well as the neurological capacity to share information,” a researcher said. The vocal capacity, too: parrots call to one another continually, squawkishly, over long distances and short. “They are communicating to each other all the time,” Juan said. The calls may be as much about asserting group identity as exchanging hunting tips. Seeking to understand why the yellow-naped Amazons in northern Costa Rica had a different call from those living 18 miles to the south, Timothy’s team tried moving several parrots from one site to the other.



The youngest parrot quickly mastered the dialect of its new home and began flocking with the locals. The older transplants, however, failed to become adept bilingualists and never quite fit in. Instead, they associated with each other. “They formed a little immigrant enclave,” Timothy said, adding, “Vocal similarity is very important for maintaining social relationships,” in parrots as in humans.



Always trying something new

Researchers are still getting a bead on parrot intelligence, and they are repeatedly surprised by each new display of it. Irene and her collaborators have shown that African grey parrots have exceptional number skills: Alex could deduce the proper order of numbers up to eight, add three small numbers together and even had a zero-like concept — “skills equivalent to those of a 41⁄2-year-old child,” Irene said.



Alice and her co-workers have found that Goffin’s cockatoos are more geared toward solving technical tasks. Alternately using their bills and feet, the birds can systematically make their way through a lock with five different complex mechanisms on it. Should they discover that one of the steps can be skipped en route to opening a chamber with a nut inside, they skip it the next time around.



And in an act of ingenuity that Alice called “sensational” for an animal not known to use tools in the wild, a cockatoo named Figaro one day started carefully chipping at the edge of a larch wood frame until he had formed a long, slender pole, which he then wielded in his bill like a hockey stick to knock out pebbles and nuts hidden under boxes.



“It took him 20 minutes to make his first tool,” Alice said. “After that, he could do it in less than five minutes.” Other cockatoos that watched Figaro build his tool and then retrieve his nut reward were soon chipping at scraps of wood and batting out nuts. Figaro didn’t stop there. Soon he was using sticks to draw patterns in the sand, Alice said.

In October last year, an American researcher and biodiversity conservationist, Lucy Diagne, hurriedly flew from her base in Senegal into Akwa Ibom state, in South-South Nigeria.

Mrs. Diagne’s trip was part of an emergency global effort to save a baby manatee rescued from local fishermen who wanted to enrich their soup-pots with the poor little animal.

Edem Eniang, the man who led other Nigerian conservationists to buy it off their hands, understood how priceless it was to save the manatee calf.

The marine mammal is among the world’s endangered species.

Besides, “the African manatee is the one species that we know the least about,” says Manatee-world.com, a website devoted to the animal.

“In fact, even getting photos of them is hard. You won’t find too many of them compiled even from those researchers that are quite fascinated with the African Manatee.”

Mr. Eniang said the baby manatee “was standing in a little well, (and) couldn’t move its body, and was dehydrated” when he found it where it was kept in captivity.

Mr. Eniang, a senior lecturer at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom state, who specialises in Wildlife Resources Management, wasn’t this lucky in 2013.

Before he could get to the scene where a giant manatee was caught in the Calabar-Itu River, the animal had died from wound sustained from the harpoon, a spear-like device, used in hunting it.

He was somehow able to take some scientific records of the manatee, said to have been about 3.9 metres long and weighed over 500 kg, almost the weight of two local cows.

The poor animal was later butchered, and sold in bits to locals who had a great day feasting on it.

The rescued calf, which attracted Mrs. Diagne to Akwa Ibom was just about one month old. Mrs Eniang named it AkwaCross – the acronym for the neigbouring states of Akwa Ibom and Cross River – because it was caught in the Calabar-Itu River which divides the two states.

Immediately Mrs Diagne got information from Mr. Eniang about AkwaCross, she thought the calf wouldn’t survive except it was kept inside a special facility that could sustain it. But such specially-built facility wasn’t available in Akwa Ibom or anywhere else in Nigeria.

The calf couldn’t also be released back into the river, according to Mr. Eniang, because “there were so many (fishing) nets and manatee traps, and the mother couldn’t be found.”

Fisheries by-catch is one of the biggest threats to manatee population, globally, a great number of fishermen around the world unintentionally harvest manatees trapped in their fishing nets.

And so the African Aquatic Conservation Fund, in which Mrs Diagne is the Executive Director, with headquarters in the United States, stepped in, and began the search for a comfortable home for AkwaCross.

Luckily, two aquariums – one in South Africa, and another in Puerto Rico – showed interest.

The AACF, according to the information it posted on its Facebook page, began talking with the Nigerian authorities on how to move the manatee out of the country.

Meanwhile, at Mr. Eniang’s private home, somewhere in the outskirt of Uyo, where the manatee was put in a 2.4 by 4.5 metres pond originally built for catfish. It wasn’t easy getting it to take the feed and the supplements sent in as donations from Jonathan Perez-Rivera, a biodiversity conservationist at the Inter American University of Puerto Rico, and Tony Mignucci, at the Centro de Conservation de Manaties de Puerto Rico.

For most of the people rendering help at Mr. Eniang’s pond, that was their first time of seeing and also getting this close to a live manatee.

Mr. Eniang had to put them through training sessions, using the how-to-do-it information he got from the university in Puerto Rico.

“It wasn’t an easy thing, but once we knew how to handle the animal we were able to feed it,” the lecturer told PREMIUM TIMES.

Four persons, including Eniang’s 20-year-old daughter, Eunice, were assigned the responsibility of feeding AkwaCross.

“We first give it multi-vitamin in the morning, before the milk. We grind the multi-vitamin, and dissolved it in a milligram of warm water,” Eunice said.

“After feeding it with the multi-vitamin, we mix the milk, Similac, into 300 milligram of warm water.

“There’s water that the white people gave us to mix with the feed; we have the lacatate green water solution, and we also have the calcium solution. We mix it together in the basin, before we prepare the feed, and then we pour it into feeding bottle which we used in feeding the animal.”

Eunice said the manatee could finish three feeding bottles at a time, and is fed like that seven times a day.

On her arrival in Uyo, Mrs. Diagne was introduced to the then Vice Chancellor of the University of Uyo, Comfort Ekpo, in the presence of the then incoming VC, Aniefiok Essien, and other management staff of the school.

Mrs. Ekpo told Mrs Diagne she believed the calf would live.

One Uniuyo lecturer at the meeting appealed for the establishment of a manatee rehabilitation facility in the school.

Later in the afternoon, Mrs Diagne was taken to see the calf.

She later stayed on to witness how the animal would take its evening meal.

“Yeah, I wanna see the little guy,” she said, as Mr. Eniang, accompanied by other Nigerian conservationists, led her to the mini wildlife park at the back of his house.

“I have come a long way to see the little guy,” Mrs Diagne said, again.

She wore an orange-colour short-sleeves shirt, with a brown combat trouser, and sneakers. She had a blonde hair. She was tall and heavily built. She exuded passion and strength.

Mrs Diagne has a PhD in Veterinary Medicine from the University of Florida, and is incredibly fascinated with manatees. She has so far spent 18 years on its research and conservation, and was the first person to scientifically prove that manatees eat mollusks and fish as well as plants, making them omnivores, not herbivores.

“I learned about manatees in school when I was 12 years old, went home and told my parents I wanted to save them (my mother loves to tell that story!). I’ve been fascinated with them for a long time, although I also studied seals for many years and really love them too,” she told PREMIUM TIMES.

She linked her fascination with manatees to the animals’ ability to navigate through muddy water to specific areas over large distances, and return to the same places year after year.

“How do they do it? Their eyesights are poor and the water is opaque, so how do they cover these large distances and return to the exact same places? Nobody knows. People say they are stupid and slow, but they are excellent navigators. And their intelligence is believed to be similar to dolphins, so they aren’t stupid.”

Mrs Diagne currently trains and leads a network of African manatee researchers in 19 countries. She believes the African manatee will only be conserved by Africans who care enough to work to save it in their countries.

According to her said African manatee exists in 21 countries, and is believed to be the most heavily hunted, although no one knows how many are killed annually. She mentioned Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cameroon as countries where the hunting of manatee is reported to be worst in Africa.

That evening, just as the sun began to set, Mrs Diagne, Mr. Eniang, and four other persons stood by the pond, chattering for few minutes, while waiting for AkwaCross to come up to the water surface.

“It doesn’t like crowd,” Mr. Eniang whispered to Mrs Diagne. “It has heard noises”.

“See it! See it!” They all shouted at the same time. But the manatee, scared by the many voices, swam underneath again, very quickly.

“Oh, it’s tiny!” Mrs Diagne said. “This guy is new born!”

A young man, wearing water-proof vest, climbed into the pond. With gloves on, he used his hands to search the murky water, for the manatee.

The man grabbed the animal within few minutes, brought the 35kg calf out to the surface, to the cheering of the people.

They handed him a plastic chair to sit on, inside the pond. He held out the manatee with his left hand, while using the right hand to insert feeding bottle into its mouth.

The manatee’s head remained visible, while the rest of the body remained submerged in water.

It was grey in colour. Its mouth resembled that of a cow. It had tiny hairs around the mouth region.

According to Seaworld.org, “Manatees have a large flexible upper lip. Their lips help guide vegetation into the mouth.

“Vibrissae (whiskers) are found on the surface of the upper lip. Each vibrissa is separately attached to nerve endings and has its own supply of blood.”

The calf, held up in an upright position, continued to drink milk from the feeding bottle.

It was a beautiful sight to behold – a baby manatee being fed, not by its mother, but by humans! It encapsulated the dream of every biodiversity conservationist, of a peaceful bond between man and animal, between the hunter and the hunted.

“It shouldn’t be drinking straight-up,” Mrs. Diagne said to the man who was feeding the manatee. “When it is with the mum, it feeds side-west.”

“Yeah, like that,” Mrs Diagne said, as the man bent the animal a little downward.

“This might just be my first Nigerian sample for genetic research,” Mrs Diagne said, with a smile.

The next day would be a busy one. AkwaCross would have to go through detailed examination, some samples would be taken from it for genetic research, its heart-rate and body temperature would be taken, and its length and weight measured, and so on.

Because of the dearth of information, generally, on African manatee, AkwaCross provided a good opportunity for Mrs. Diagne.

She and the local Nigerian team assembled the next morning, at about 8a.m, at Mr. Eniang’s place for the procedure.

While taking them through a brief lecture on the process it would take, Mrs Diagne assured the team that manatee could survive pretty outside the water.

“Someone needs to help us monitor its breathing,” she said. “Manatees don’t know when they are out of water; they still raise their head to breathe, they still think they are inside the water.”

AkwaCross was pulled out from the pond, and brought under the shade where the procedure was to take place.

Mrs Diagne began touching the animal, while explaining some of its body parts to the team. She suddenly stopped, bowed her head, and then sighed.

“Oh, no! I don’t know,” she said. It was a sad tone.

She sighed again.

“It’s off!” One of the Uniuyo lecturers injected.

At that point, the painful truth became obvious to everyone: AkwaCross was dead!

“It’s a shame,” Mrs. Diagne said. “I can’t believe this.

“It went through a lot of trauma, being captured and put in a well…. Like I said, it might not have been doing well from the start, but from the surface, it might look okay.”

Mr. Eniang, too shocked to utter a word, folded his arms across his chest, and was gazing at the lifeless body of baby AkwaCross on the floor.

Everyone was downcast, and Mrs Diagne kept telling them that it wasn’t their fault.

“It was looking absolutely fine to me last night…. You guys didn’t do anything wrong.”

People around the world who were following AkwaCross’ progress through the AACF Facebook page felt sad as well.

Mrs Diagne was smart enough to quickly reset everyone’s mood; the team began to probe what actually killed the baby manatee, and few minutes into necropsy, it was discovered that it died of dehydration.

She used the session to teach the team about manatee – their anatomy, habitat, their significant life cycle, and what could be done to protect and conserve them.

“They eat water weeds, they keep the water ways clear, and their faeces feed baby fish, and everybody wants to eat fish. Manatees are part of life cycle, they help the fish.

“At Senegal, we declared a wildlife refuge for manatee and other aquatic animals. We worked in partnership with the local communities, and they banned all fishing activities. And the fishermen are now catching the biggest fish just outside the refuge.”

Manatee has the potentials to boost eco-tourism in Nigeria and other African countries, but the people must first learn how to stop hunting them, said Mrs. Diagne.

The next day, Mrs. Diagne took the manatee enlightenment to Uniuyo campus where a handful of lecturers turned up for a one-day seminar arranged by Mr. Eniang.

At the school, some new converts pledged to join the growing campaign for the protection of the African manatees. There were also calls on the government, both at the federal and states, to show more interest and commitment in biodiversity conservation.

Mr. Eniang, whose name is fast becoming synonymous to wildlife conservation in Nigeria, is somewhat happy that AkwaCross didn’t die in vain.

But beyond his love for conservation and the successes he has recorded, Mr. Eniang also symbolises the paradox in the story of conservation in Africa — It was animals in the African wild that his parents hunted, killed, and sold in training him in school.

“This is like a payback for me,” Mr. Eniang said.

“Today, Juliana is going to the university, and I’m not killing animals to send her to school,” he said. “I am going to train her from money made from working for government. My generation will never hunt animals again.

“But how can you plant conservation etiquette in a mind that is hungry? There’s so much hunger in the land, there’s so much challenge for survival. So, nobody will listen to you except you give them an alternative. We need to build that into the conservation plan.”","SPECIAL REPORT: Saved from being eaten by fishermen, one animal draws global attention to Nigeria",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcmVtaXVtdGltZXNuZy5jb20vcGFuYW1hLXBhcGVycy8yMDE4Mzctc3BlY2lhbC1yZXBvcnQtc2F2ZWQtZWF0ZW4tZmlzaGVybWVuLW9uZS1hbmltYWwtZHJhd3MtZ2xvYmFsLWF0dGVudGlvbi1uaWdlcmlhLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i2.wp.com/media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2016/04/Dr.-Lucy-Diagne-conducting-necropsy-animal-version-of-autopsy-on-AkwaCross.-Photo-credit-Mrs.-Idorenyin-Gideon.jpg?fit=800%2C450&ssl=1,2016-04-15,"{'sent': 'In October last year, an American researcher and biodiversity conservationist, Lucy Diagne, hurriedly flew from her base in Senegal into Akwa Ibom state, in South-South Nigeria.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Lucy Diagne']}}","Related News

Because of the dearth of information, generally, on African manatee, AkwaCross provided a good opportunity for Mrs. Diagne.

She and the local Nigerian team assembled the next morning, at about 8a.m, at Mr. Eniang’s place for the procedure.

While taking them through a brief lecture on the process it would take, Mrs Diagne assured the team that manatee could survive pretty outside the water.

“Someone needs to help us monitor its breathing,” she said. “Manatees don’t know when they are out of water; they still raise their head to breathe, they still think they are inside the water.”

AkwaCross was pulled out from the pond, and brought under the shade where the procedure was to take place.

Mrs Diagne began touching the animal, while explaining some of its body parts to the team. She suddenly stopped, bowed her head, and then sighed.

“Oh, no! I don’t know,” she said. It was a sad tone.

She sighed again.

“It’s off!” One of the Uniuyo lecturers injected.

At that point, the painful truth became obvious to everyone: AkwaCross was dead!

“It’s a shame,” Mrs. Diagne said. “I can’t believe this.

“It went through a lot of trauma, being captured and put in a well…. Like I said, it might not have been doing well from the start, but from the surface, it might look okay.”

Mr. Eniang, too shocked to utter a word, folded his arms across his chest, and was gazing at the lifeless body of baby AkwaCross on the floor.

Everyone was downcast, and Mrs Diagne kept telling them that it wasn’t their fault.

“It was looking absolutely fine to me last night…. You guys didn’t do anything wrong.”

People around the world who were following AkwaCross’ progress through the AACF Facebook page felt sad as well.

Mrs Diagne was smart enough to quickly reset everyone’s mood; the team began to probe what actually killed the baby manatee, and few minutes into necropsy, it was discovered that it died of dehydration.

She used the session to teach the team about manatee – their anatomy, habitat, their significant life cycle, and what could be done to protect and conserve them.

“They eat water weeds, they keep the water ways clear, and their faeces feed baby fish, and everybody wants to eat fish. Manatees are part of life cycle, they help the fish.

“At Senegal, we declared a wildlife refuge for manatee and other aquatic animals. We worked in partnership with the local communities, and they banned all fishing activities. And the fishermen are now catching the biggest fish just outside the refuge.”

Manatee has the potentials to boost eco-tourism in Nigeria and other African countries, but the people must first learn how to stop hunting them, said Mrs. Diagne.

The next day, Mrs. Diagne took the manatee enlightenment to Uniuyo campus where a handful of lecturers turned up for a one-day seminar arranged by Mr. Eniang.

At the school, some new converts pledged to join the growing campaign for the protection of the African manatees. There were also calls on the government, both at the federal and states, to show more interest and commitment in biodiversity conservation.

Mr. Eniang, whose name is fast becoming synonymous to wildlife conservation in Nigeria, is somewhat happy that AkwaCross didn’t die in vain.

But beyond his love for conservation and the successes he has recorded, Mr. Eniang also symbolises the paradox in the story of conservation in Africa — It was animals in the African wild that his parents hunted, killed, and sold in training him in school.

“This is like a payback for me,” Mr. Eniang said.

“Today, Juliana is going to the university, and I’m not killing animals to send her to school,” he said. “I am going to train her from money made from working for government. My generation will never hunt animals again.

“But how can you plant conservation etiquette in a mind that is hungry? There’s so much hunger in the land, there’s so much challenge for survival. So, nobody will listen to you except you give them an alternative. We need to build that into the conservation plan.”","[{'DATE', 'October last year'}, {'American', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Lucy Diagne'}, {'Senegal', 'GPE'}, {'ORG', 'Akwa Ibom'}, {'South-South Nigeria',

0,"In Part 1 of Conservation, Divided, veteran Mongabay reporter Jeremy Hance explores how the world’s biggest conservation groups have embraced a human-centric approach known as “new conservation” that has split the field over how best to save life on Earth.

Neither side of the debate disagrees that conservation today is failing to adequately halt mass extinction. But how to proceed is where talks break down, especially when it comes to the importance of protected areas and the efficacy of the biggest, most recognizable groups.

Conservation, Divided is an in-depth four-part series investigating how the field of conservation has changed over the last 30 years — and the challenges it faces moving into an uncertain future. Hance completed the series over the course of eight months. Stories will run weekly through May 17.

A few months after I began working full time as an environmental journalist in 2009, I found myself in Malaysian Borneo. I spent a day with a small group of conservationists and officials driving through a seemingly endless expanse of oil palm before coming to the lower Kinabatangan River. There, Borneo’s famous wildlife — orangutans, elephants, sun bears, and clouded leopards — was squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of habitat in the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary.

Frankly, after the miles of oil palm it was hard to imagine anything bigger than a house cat surviving there, let alone herds of elephants. That night, we met informally with some World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) staff at a local guesthouse. They excitedly explained the ambitious plan of the world’s most recognizable conservation group to preserve wildlife in Borneo from an unprecedented onslaught of logging, mining, and oil palm.

They handed me a glossy booklet filled with gorgeous photographs of charismatic Bornean wildlife frolicking and local people looking happy. Dubbed the Heart of Borneo project, WWF along with the three governments on the island planned to safeguard a region spreading over 23 million hectares and owned by three countries. The plan wasn’t to turn the area — larger than Great Britain — into a park, but instead into a sustainably managed landscape, something decidedly novel that involved partnering with the palm oil, logging, and mining industries to achieve. It would be a place, they claimed, where wildlife and indigenous groups could thrive. A big chunk of Borneo might just remain ecologically whole.

It sounded like a grand, ambitious, lovely idea. And as they told me about it, the WWF staff seemed eager for me to look impressed.

But then I said, “Well, this all looks great, but how are you going to do it?”

Now, maybe I had put my foot on cultural norms in Malaysia, but I found that the same faces that had looked excited and eager only a moment earlier either stared at me blankly or avoided my gaze. No one said anything; no one had an answer.

Something seemed missing.

Bashing the big

One of the things you discover as an environmental journalist is just how quickly scientists and conservationists are happy to bash — off the record, of course — big conservation groups. These include four of the world’s largest wildlife and wild-lands-focused groups with a global footprint: WWF, Conservation International (CI), the Nature Conservancy (TNC), and at times, though to a much lesser extent, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Together these four groups employ over ten thousand people in nearly a hundred countries and have a collective annual income of around $2 billion. In many parts of the world, if not most, one of these four groups is likely to be seen as the public face of conservation efforts.

Over the years former employees have regularly dished the dirt to me about missed opportunities, misplaced values, and projects that seemed to fail as often as they succeeded, while current employees often sounded like public relations officials speaking in staccato. Outside conservationists often complained that the big NGOs took credit for their hard work and bungled local relationships. The same concerns would come up repeatedly: an obsession with the organization’s brand at the expense of success, a corporate-mimicked hierarchy, cushy relationships with some of the world’s biggest environmentally destructive corporations, radio silence on so many environmental issues, and an inability to respond to crises that are appearing with ever-more regularity.

Now, it’s not exactly surprising that former employees would sometimes complain about their last job; or that some environmental programs, with all their complexities and in the face of so many pressures, would fail; or that small conservation NGOs might be jealous of bigger groups. But as time went by I became so accustomed to hearing how bad big conservation has become, that I found myself startled when a conservationist had nothing but good things to say about his former employer (WWF-Poland) over beers. It was a first.

As so many sources told similar stories over and over, I began to wonder: has something really gone wrong? Was this just to be expected in a highly competitive landscape full of idealistic and passionate characters facing down ecological catastrophe…or has big conservation gone astray?

To find answers, one has to go back some 30 years when conservationists began dabbling with a new philosophy.

The rise of “new conservation”

The biggest shift in conservation in recent times is the rise of something called “new conservation.” This change is the origin of some — but by no means all — of the criticism flung at big conservation today.

Since the beginnings of the modern conservation movement — often linked to the rise of national parks in the nineteenth century — conservation has been largely about setting aside tracts of land or water and developing ways to protect endangered species. While early conservation efforts were in part propelled by economic and human-oriented values (such as hunting and recreation), they also placed a major emphasis on saving nature for its intrinsic and spiritual worth.

“There is a love of wild nature in everybody, an ancient mother-love ever showing itself whether recognized or no, and however covered by cares and duties,” wrote John Muir, one of the great fathers of modern environmentalism.

Inspired by Muir and others, many environmentalists argued that whatever nature might be worth economically to humankind now or in the future, it possesses a deeper importance that can’t and shouldn’t be measured in dollar signs. We should protect nature not because it serves myriad human needs (even though it does), but because we have a moral duty to do so.

Yet in recent decades the pendulum has swung back toward viewing nature through a largely utilitarian lens. This is perhaps not surprising given the rise of global environmental threats like climate change, ocean acidification, overpopulation, pollution, and mass extinction — and the growing realization that these threats could actually unhinge the workings of human civilization and plunge millions, maybe billions, into misery.

But this shift also followed the rise of neoliberalism in the 1970s and 80s, a movement that espoused de-regulation, distrust in governments, and deepening trust (some might even say religious-like fanaticism) in free markets and private enterprise. Conservationists were not immune to such beliefs. Following this period, environmentalists took a page from economists in attempting to meticulously measure everything in nature for its economic worth today and even make guesses about tomorrow. How much is pollination worth? Carbon sequestration? Water filtration?

A wonderful vision took form: if we could only incorporate the dollar value of nature into our current economic system — and convince policy makers and business people to understand that unrecognized economic value — we could save the world. This economic-centric approach has come to be called “new conservation.”

New conservationists argue that past conservation efforts never fully comprehended or addressed the real causes of biodiversity loss.

Tom Dillon, Senior Vice President of Forests and Freshwater for World Wildlife Fund-US (part of WWF), told me that the “core” of new conservation is transforming the drivers of destruction to be more environmentally friendly.

So, the new philosophy largely turned to focus on lands and waters outside protected areas with attempts to green big industries like agriculture, logging, fisheries, and mining.

“Expanding agriculture is responsible for most of the world’s deforestation. Polluted runoff and fragmented ecosystems from poorly planned infrastructure, such as roads and dams, is a major threat to the world’s rivers. Understanding the magnitude of these threats has helped us in creating innovative approaches to addressing them,” Dillon said. “And that is the only way we will be able to protect the world’s wildlife.”

To address the drivers, new conservationists have built elaborate certification schemes (like the Forest Stewardship Council for wood products or the Marine Stewardship Council for seafood) in order to convince industry that self-regulation can lead to both higher profits and more secure natural resources. They have also crafted still-nascent “payment for ecosystem services” programs that seek to pay governments or landowners to keep environments intact (such as REDD+ for carbon sequestration in forests). And they have focused on anti-poverty or sustainable development programs as a way to counter environmental destruction by the world’s poorest. New conservationists have also partnered with all variety of industries and corporations, including some of the most destructive, in order to help them clean up — and in some cases, it seems, also to access their sizable donations.

New conservation quickly captured most of the big conservation groups. All the mega-international NGOs — WWF, CI, TNC, and to a lesser extent WCS — have incorporated elements of new conservation into their myriad projects. For example, while TNC focuses on traditional conservation in the U.S. by buying up land, its overseas projects are largely new-conservation oriented.

Dillon said that his group’s adoption of the new conservation ethos came from realizing just how bad things had gotten. He pointed to WWF’s Living Planet Report, which assesses the state of the natural world every two years.

“The [2014] report showed all indicators, from biodiversity to climate change, trending negatively,” Dillon said, noting that these reports, which began in 1998, have made WWF realize that “we had won some crucial, hard-fought battles, but we were losing the war. We knew we had to change.”

Although WWF started out dedicated to on-the-ground work to save target species, more and more of its programs have revolved around new conservation ideas in recent years. The Heart of Borneo is just one example. Still, Deon Nel, the Global Conservation Director with WWF, insists the primary focus of the group “will always be” wildlife.

But many outside observers disagree. One of them is John Payne, who spent nearly thirty years working at and with WWF – Malaysia. Today, he is the head of the Borneo Rhino Alliance, trying to save the subspecies from extinction. He told me that WWF has changed significantly over the last three decades. “WWF allocates rather small proportions of its funding to programs on individual species to prevent their extinction. This is a significant departure from [its] founding aim.”

Still, some traditional conservationists dispute that idea that there is anything really new about new conservation.

“There has absolutely not been a shift from nature-only to people-too. Conservation from its beginnings in the 1800s has always included human interest in its work, including both economic desires and harm from environmental degradation,” Kierán Suckling, Executive Director of the Tucson-based NGO Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), told me, pointing out that even John Muir was a farmer and rancher.

New conservationists have simply marketed their ideas as novel for self-promotion, he charged. “The first rule of selling widgets is that all widgets must be described as radically new and better,” said Suckling. “Otherwise no one will be interested in your widget. Don’t be fooled by the widget sellers.”

Suckling’s point is noteworthy, but what is certainly new is how many formerly wildlife-centric groups are now focused on the human and economic sides of nature. Traditional conservation has been “obviously…de-emphasized” within the biggest conservation groups, according to Leo Bottrill, who worked at WWF for six years and now heads Moabi, an initiative to map and monitor deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“There’s less money going into [traditional conservation]. There’s less support for it. There’s less capacity,” Bottrill said.

And, according to many of their critics, the big NGOs have gone too far.

Noga Shanee, co-founder of a small NGO in Peru called Neotropical Primate Conservation, says new conservation really should be called “neo-liberal conservation.” She dubs its activities “near-conservation actions” or “beating about the conservation bush.”

“There is so much effort, so much money, pouring into enormous projects that are not directly focused on conservation,” she told me.

She criticizes new conservation for being “full of paradoxes,” like forcing indigenous people to become farmers, selling off forests for cash, and supporting monoculture plantations. But — most egregiously in her mind — this type of conservation continues to push trophy hunting even when targeting Critically Endangered species like the black rhino (Diceros bicornis).

Asserting that often when local people hunt they are “poachers,” but when rich foreigners do so they are “conservationists,” Shanee added that new conservation groups “also sometimes change hunting to ecotourism, bioprospecting, or other less destructive activities, but the idea is basically the same, conservation is largely used as a justification for territorialism.”

According to critics like Shanee, new conservation’s focus on economics and drivers — at the expense of setting aside more wilderness areas or taking action to save species on the brink — is at best risky and at worst a red herring. They contend that new conservationists have traded in programs focusing directly on wildlife for ones that may or may not help endangered species. And that by dropping arguments about morality and values, new conservationists have essentially handed the argument to nature utilitarians: if the rabbit has no economic value, kill the rabbit. In today’s red in tooth and claw capitalism, nature must pay for itself.

A vigorous debate: parks and values

The debate over traditional versus new conservation has been vitriolic, impassioned, and at times downright ugly. Researchers, conservation workers, and journalists have fired slings and arrows in academic journals, in newspapers, at conferences, in blogs, and in person. Conservation thinkers have become divided.

Neither side disagrees that conservation today — both traditional and new — is failing to adequately halt mass extinction. But how to proceed is where talks break down, especially when it comes to the importance of protected areas.

Proponents of traditional conservation view protected areas as conservation’s biggest success in the last 150 years. They argue that conservationists should urgently focus on creating more of them, as well as increasing on-the-ground efforts to save on-the-brink species.

Protected areas currently cover about 12 to 15 percent of land and 3 percent of the oceans, though they are steadily ratcheting up in the latter. Without them, proponents argue, the extinction crisis would be orders of magnitude worse, with countless species having gone extinct that are still here today. Indeed, research in the past few years has backed that up by showing that protected areas house more biodiversity and in greater abundance than adjacent areas.

But proponents of new conservation say this approach is insufficient. “We are convinced that protected areas alone are not enough,” writes Michelle Marvier, an environmental scientist at Santa Clara University, in a 2013 editorial in Conservation Biology with the unwavering title “New Conservation Is True Conservation.” She compares the call for more protected areas to the call for more hospital beds during the AIDS crisis — in other words reactive rather proactive, a Band-Aid over a gaping wound. “Despite great successes in the establishment of protected areas, the rate of species extinction remains unacceptably high,” she writes.

New conservationists have also attacked the idea that there is really any pristine place left in the world, with the implication that preserving wilderness in some pre-human state should no longer be the goal. Instead, we should find a way to live with nature that supports the seven-billion-and-rising people on the planet.

“I think most conservationists would say ‘yes,’ that’s absolutely right, and that’s what we’re fighting against,” Don Weeden told me, referring to the idea that nothing is pristine. Weeden directs the Bedford Hills, New York-based Weeden Foundation, which supports mainly traditional conservation projects around the world. “Certainly any wilderness area will be compromised, but what we’re trying to do is basically save the best of what’s left,” he said.

One of the reasons why the traditional versus new debate has hit such a nerve is because it touches wholly sensitive places like one’s values and morals. New conservationists contend that traditionalists have not put enough value on human needs and economic requirements. But for their part, traditionalists believe new conservationists have lost sight of nature’s intrinsic value — of the ethical imperative that a species has every right to exist regardless of any benefits (or lack thereof) it may provide humanity. Traditionalists fear that once we have to have an economic value attached to a place or a species, we will begin to lose many of both.

What if we discover that the Critically Endangered Bale Mountains treefrog (Balebreviceps hillmani) is worth just $15 in Ethiopia a year as a research curiosity? Or that the northern sportive lemur (Lepilemur septentrionalis) is worth just $150 in tourism revenue a year to Madagascar, whereas replacing its habitat with crops could yield significantly more for the local community?

Yet new conservationists contend that this is the wrong way to look at it: ecosystems like forests provide multiple benefits for people — carbon and water filtration, in addition to biodiversity — that add up economically.

In pushing the economic value of nature, new conservationists say they are also simply responding to polls showing that declining numbers of the public view themselves as environmentalists or conservationists (at least in the U.S.), as well as looking for practical ways to convince governments and corporations that environmental action need not come as a threat to neo-liberal capitalism as it is currently practiced.

“For me personally, I love nature,” Will Turner, senior vice president and chief scientist with CI, told me. “I love biodiversity. I also love people. And I think I’m entirely comfortable with having a value system that includes both the intrinsic value of nature… [and] the foundational importance of ecosystems on this planet for human survival and prosperity.”

Wherever the balance lies, new conservation has birthed truly novel programs that its proponents contend could go a long way toward really saving nature.

Are certification schemes worth it?

Go to an upscale grocery store and you might notice a profusion of stamps: there’s the blue, fishy Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) stamp, the green palm frond stamp from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the check-marked tree from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), and the frog stamp from the Rainforest Alliance. This is one of the fruits of new conservation: rapidly multiplying, sometimes competing certification schemes that attempt to control the drivers of environmental destruction by steering consumer dollars toward more sustainable products. Big conservation groups have been instrumental in creating and shaping many of these schemes.

Critics say such certification schemes give consumers the false impression that somehow the product they buy doesn’t harm the environment, when in fact, at best, it only lessens the damage done. For example, FSC-certified paper is likely a better purchase than non-certified paper, but it’s not in any way better than simply forgoing paper in the first place or choosing 100-percent recycled. The devil is in the details — and the details of each certification scheme can be complex and opaque.

Watchdog NGOs have accused certification schemes of having poor standards and lax enforcement and of being too influenced by the industries they are supposed to rein-in. For example, environmental critics call certain of FSC’s standards unsustainable, such as its permission of logging in primary forests, monoculture tree plantations, and even clearcutting in some cases. FSC products are also often designated as “FSC Mix,” which can mean they contain only a percentage of FSC-certified material, while the rest is “Controlled Wood” that meets certain minimal standards but does not follow more stringent rules required for FSC certification.

Part of the reason such allowances arise is because certification schemes are not designed solely by the big NGOs, but are the result of often hard-fought compromises and back-door meetings between NGOs, companies and industry groups, governments, and other “stakeholders.” Certification schemes are also only as good as the auditors that inspect the operations (usually only once a year), but many have run into trouble for having shoddy and even corrupt auditing — most recently the RSPO.

Despite such concerns, Dillon with WWF said that the amount of land certified by the FSC was one of WWF’s biggest organizational successes in the last 20 years. WWF helped create the FSC in 1993 and remains a member and staunch supporter today. Dillon pointed out that 15.5 percent of the world’s production forests are currently certified by FSC, an area larger than Iran spanning more than 182 million hectares. He also said that the FSC’s standards are improving: in 2014, the council strengthened protections in “Intact Forest Landscapes,” large areas of primary forest that haven’t been cut by roads or other infrastructure.

“WWF believes the FSC has the most rigorous forest management standards for environmental and social responsibility,” said Dillon. “We also believe that obtaining FSC certification and sourcing FSC-certified products is one of the best approaches to conserving the world’s forests.”

But critics say that in its 20-plus years, the FSC has done little to protect the world’s most biodiverse forests. In 2013, only 19 million hectares of FSC-certified forest (about 10 percent of the FSC’s total) were located in the tropics — and a quarter of these were monoculture plantations, which have very little biodiversity value. The FSC has certified four times more forest in Europe than in all of the world’s tropical countries. If the point of the FSC was to help protect wildlife, to date it has largely missed the world’s most wildlife-rich landscapes — and those, of course, with the most threatened species.

Yet even some traditional conservationists view certification schemes as a useful way of responding to the global environmental crisis.

Payne of the Borneo Rhino Alliance, a member of the RSPO, says the palm-oil certification scheme provides a positive course in the absence of more protected areas by making “environmental standards transparent and mandatory for members.” The fact that governments often try to “meddle” in the process proves the RSPO’s worth, he said.

In Payne’s view, governments are holding too tightly on the reins of wildlife conservation while certification schemes like the RSPO return some power to NGOs.

But Jennifer Jacquet, an environmental studies professor at New York University, says governments need more responsibility not less. She critiqued certification schemes in her 2015 book Is Shame Necessary? by arguing that they move responsibility for environmental health from the government, which can make large-scale and comprehensive changes, to the purchasing public, which can only make hodgepodge and arguably slight changes. Many companies can still get away with environmental destruction, since there will always be consumers willing to buy their products as long as they can pay less. For example, while RSPO certification may prove successful for a percentage of products sold in Europe and America, the bulk of the world’s palm oil is actually consumed by China, India, and Indonesia — where such schemes currently don’t look very promising.

“Most certification schemes have had a marginal effect on ecology, sucked up major amounts of conservation funding, and, as I argue, have been a major distraction from making bigger, blanket changes,” Jacquet told Mongabay in an interview last year. She noted that the MSC only covers 7 percent of the global seafood market.

But proponents of certification schemes argue that they take time to really begin to make a difference and that they have already succeeded in improving the environmental impacts of some industries, if only partially and in specific regions.

Still, critics say all the effort expended on these schemes would have been better spent on convincing individual governments and the international community to improve regulations across the board. In the end, they say, what’s needed is not the multiplication of voluntary schemes dependent on consumer awareness, but better, stronger regulation ensuring that all the fish at sushi counters, all the wood at Home Depot, all the palm oil at Wal-Mart are sustainably sourced.

Can ecosystems pay for themselves?

However controversial certification schemes may be, they have been wildly successful in bringing big conservation and industry together to wrestle with difficult problems. Whether they will end up being wholly transformative remains to be seen. An even more difficult baby of new conservation, however, has been the dream of getting the market and governments to recognize the economic value of what has come to be known as ecosystem services, or in layman’s terms the free stuff nature gives us, like clean water, oxygen, carbon sequestration, and pollination.

New conservationists have used research on ecosystem services to try to convince governments to protect important environments like watersheds, mangroves, and forests. They have also crafted new programs, known as “payment for ecosystem services programs,” based on the idea that governments or corporations would actually pay outright to protect such services. But to date, such programs, like the U.N.’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+), have struggled to get off the ground. For example, REDD+ proposes that wealthy countries pay poor countries to keep their forests standing for the carbon they sequester. But most of the program’s life, which began officially in 2008, has been taken up by negotiations. Roadblocks have included trouble with indigenous groups who view it as a new form of forest-grabbing, lack of support from local governments, and difficulty raising the required funds. It remains to be seen whether the Paris Agreement will give it a much-needed shot in the arm.

Critics say that payment for ecosystem service programs have promised more than they can shell out. For example, they contend that really no monetary calculation of a forest’s services can compete with something as lucrative as an oil-palm plantation or a mine for highly desirable minerals.

But Turner with CI noted that there are cases where ecosystem services can already compete, especially when one includes the full range of services, instead of focusing on just one, like REDD+ does with carbon sequestration.

“I think mangroves are great example of this… There have been various studies comparing the value of mangrove ecosystems relative to the most profitable alternative use,” he said. Mangroves provide nurseries for fisheries, carbon sequestration, and non-timber forest products for locals. They also buffer against storm surges, which means mangroves actually save lives. “And you add those up and it’s much more valuable than the sort of near-term profits from conversion to shrimp aquaculture,” Turner said.

Mangroves may indeed be worth much more standing than shrimp aquaculture, but that hasn’t stopped them from being destroyed around the world at record rates. Between 1990 and 2005, the world lost somewhere between 19 and 35 percent of its mangroves. Experts say that mangroves have fallen at a rate of three-to-five times faster than forests on land, imperiling not just biodiversity but human lives. In other words, even when policy makers know an ecosystem is worth more standing they don’t always protect it — at least not yet.

Turner admitted there are also cases where exploitation trumps ecosystems economically. Mining is one. “You are never going to be able to put a value on those few square acres around the mine site as of greater economic value to people than the millions of dollars in minerals,” he said, adding that in such cases it’s important to reduce the overall destruction as much as possible. Of course, the impacts of mining go far beyond the immediate area destroyed, such as pollution leaking into the water table and rising into the air, as well as additional infrastructure like roads to bring minerals to the market.

Another factor complicating the payment for ecosystem services approach is that uncertainties stack up when trying to measure ecosystem services. For one thing, as climate change worsens there is the potential for carbon sequestration to become more valuable. And the same could be said of many services in an age of environmental loss, such as clean water and pollination.

This kind of potential future worth that doesn’t end up on the balance sheet today should still be considered, said Turner, who pointed to rainforests as storehouses for undiscovered drugs.

“My father got a multiple drug-resistant infection two years ago [and] nearly died. The compound that saved him was vancomycin, one of these antibiotics of last resort, that it turns out was collected on an expedition funded by Eli Lilly fifty years ago in Borneo,” said Turner. “This rainforest compound literally on the other side of the planet from my father, fifty years in the future…saved his life. Meanwhile, that forest today is cleaning water and providing water and supporting the fisheries that people…depend on very directly right now.”

Turner said that identifying a wide range of ecosystem services also allows conservationists to expand the number of institutions and people involved in conservation, and to make the case for conservation to a broader audience.

But Payne of the Borneo Rhino Alliance argued that focusing on ecosystem services has left wildlife adrift. “What is not sensible is to argue for economic reasons to protect species when no economic arguments exist…[Conservationists] not only have to make up potentially spurious arguments, but people in general start to believe that nature conservation has to be linked to economics,” he said. “[T]he ‘new conservation’ approach is normally too generic to save any endangered species, except by luck.”

For example, even assuming that estimating a value for an ecosystem’s services results in setting land aside, Payne said that doesn’t necessarily mean the species living there will be protected. Wildlife is facing a rising barrage of threats beyond habitat loss, including wildlife trade and climate change. Many species will still require on-the-ground efforts to make it through the next hundred years, even if their habitat remains. But this is exactly the kind of work that has fallen by the wayside in the age of new conservation.

“There’s no substitution for working directly with park authorities…to implement conservation programs,” said Bottrill of Moabi, who spent several years doing just that earlier in his conservation career.

He added, “[You] still need to learn about species and how you manage and maintain them. These problems haven’t gone away.” Bottrill pointed to the catastrophic bushmeat trade in Africa as a glaring sign of the need for more conservation boots on the ground, not fewer.

The bottom line for critics is that the ecosystem services approach is just another way that new conservation has moved away from directly protecting endangered species, even as threats multiply and populations plunge.

The unmeasurables?

If you’re working on saving the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) from extinction it’s relatively straightforward to tell if your project is working: simply count the population and see if it’s declining, rising, or stable. One of the strongest, most persistent criticisms of new conservation is that it’s far more difficult to measure success or failure when it comes to how ecosystem services, certification schemes, anti-poverty programs, or aligning with industries are actually helping wildlife.

“[Funds] have been spent over many years on the new conservation approach without measurable outputs. This approach is commonly just that: an approach without clear goals,” said Payne. “Success or failure is subjective.”

Traditional conservationists will tell you that measuring biodiversity — as opposed to just a single species — can itself prove problematic, but measuring the impact of a certification or payment for ecosystem services program on biodiversity muddies things further. In fact, even though new conservation has been around for decades, critics say groups have been reluctant to commission hard research to see if their programs are living up to the hype.

Suzanne Apple, WWF-US’s Senior Vice President of Private Sector Engagement, admitted that credibly measuring success is something conservation in general could improve. But she said WWF is working on it.

“We’ve learned through experience that we need to link our conservation work to hard numbers so that we can better understand where we’re making progress and where we might need to change course,” she said. “WWF has taken steps toward a clearer strategy…and we have incorporated measuring and evaluation into our planning processes.“

A lack of good research on the efficacy of new conservation programs means that many groups are still in the dark about how well their programs work. Surprisingly, there have been few comprehensive studies looking at whether FSC-certified logging operations have actually prevented deforestation or protected biodiversity, even though FSC has been around for nearly a quarter century. But a 2015 study in PLOS ONE evaluating logging concessions in Indonesian Borneo found that FSC-certified operations did decrease deforestation — but only by 5 percent compared to non-certified forests. The study also found that FSC-certified forests had no impact on the outbreak of fires or on the fragmentation of forests’ core areas, one proxy for biodiversity. On the other hand, the study found that villages in FSC-certified forests were better off by various measures. “The actual impact is negligible…there are some benefit[s] but it’s not that much better than the alternative,” concluded Bottrill of the research in Indonesian Borneo.

However another recent study in Chile found that FSC-certified plantations reduced deforestation by 43 percent and bested other sustainability schemes in the area. But, even here, the goal was to reduce deforestation to zero, so while FSC fared better in Chile’s temperate forests than in Kalimantan’s rainforests, it still missed its overall mark.

At the same time, Shanee of Neotropical Primate Conservation said that new conservation groups dwell in a “culture of reproducing super success stories” even when there is no evidence of success. “It always seems to surprise everyone that with all these excellent conservation efforts, species keep being wiped out.”

For Nel of WWF, comparing outcomes of traditional and new conservation is like comparing apples and oranges for one important reason: timeframe. Nel noted that establishing protected areas results in rapid outcomes. But when you target the drivers of environmental problems through a certification scheme or payment for ecosystem services program it takes longer to know if your effort was successful.

Nel said conservation today needs to learn to “play the long game” if it’s going to tackle the forces behind environmental degradation, such as industries, markets, and consumption patterns. And so the very nature of WWF’s work today means a scale of ambition unseen in conservation just a few decades ago.

“These aren’t immediate fixes as when you’re working very close to the ground,” he said.

Too big to succeed?

But Nel’s point begs the question: has the ambition of conservation groups outstripped their abilities? Has their size, which ballooned in recent decades, become more of a liability than a strength? Or is this the only way to tackle mounting environmental crises that now crisscross national borders and permeate all levels of society?

The two really big fish here are TNC and WWF, which brought in $949 million and $700 million respectively in 2014. WCS brought in $253 million and CI brought in $152 million that year, making them small compared to the other two, but still giants next to most conservation groups.

TNC employs around 3,500 and works in more than 30 countries, though it focuses heavily on the U.S. WWF employs 6,000 people and works in some 100 countries and has 5 million supporters around the world. WCS employs 4,000 people around the world. CI employs 800 people in 30 countries. Even as WWF and TNC are Earth’s conservation juggernauts, they are far overshadowed by dozens of other charities, such as United Way or the Salvation Army.

Conservation groups remain underdogs in the nonprofit world and have problems that nonprofits geared toward human welfare do not. Conservation groups not only have to work to protect nature, but also have to convince governments and society of the importance of the environment and its millions of species. Humans rarely need to be convinced of the importance of humans.

But critics say big conservation’s very expansiveness has tended to make it less nimble, more bureaucratic, less adaptable — in short, less efficient and effective. Today, large conservation NGOs often commit themselves to long-term programs, making U-turns nearly impossible and making it difficult for them to respond to conservation crises with funds or expertise, according to many sources. Critics argue, for instance, that big conservation groups have dropped the ball on, and maybe even exacerbated, the bushmeat-poaching frenzy taking place in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America by turning their focus away from endangered species.

Big conservation is further hampered by an ossifying hierarchy that is steeped in bureaucracy, according to its many critics, who say new ideas from lower-level employees are stifled before they can rise to the top, along with their concerns. I don’t know how many times I’ve heard the story of a new employee coming into a major conservation group excited and passionate, only to become disillusioned and frustrated over time — and often fearing to speak out.

All this has made it almost impossible for hard-working conservationists to take the kind of bold action necessary to save species on the edge of extinction, according to sources. Some traditional conservationists even suggested that the big groups could achieve more by partnering with top conservationists, which was the way WWF operated from the 1960s to the 1980s, and then granting them considerable freedom.

This is the sort of model that the one group, San Francisco-based Wildlife Conservation Network (WCN), has undertaken. WCN assists conservationists around the globe with fundraising, publicity, and scaling up their work, without imposing additional bureaucracy.

“We exist to support their brands, not ours,” Jefe Parrish, WCN’s Vice President for Conservation and a former WWF employee, told me. A common criticism of big NGOs, on the other hand, is that they tend to swallow up, and even take credit for, the work of smaller groups.

Parrish noted that WCN was able to launch an ambitious initiative called the Elephant Crisis Fund after a discussion that lasted only a day, whereas making that kind of decision at a mega-NGO could drag on for a year. Characteristics such as innovation, speed, nimbleness, and collaborativeness are not easily found at any of the big NGOs, Parrish said.

Still, being big isn’t all bad. WWF has “immense convening power,” according to former employee Bottrill. It may take the group a long time to get behind something due to reputational concerns, “but when it did, it could be a force to be reckoned with,” he said. No one likes an angry panda.

Few, if any, conservation experts would disagree with the need for the kind of large-scale transformational change the conservation giants are aiming for. But some do still question whether these groups are the right institutions to take this on, are really capable of transforming global markets and governments at the scale needed, or are employing the right strategies.

An alternative vision of future conservation might be famed biologist E.O. Wilson’s Nature Needs Half initiative, according to contacts. The idea is that humanity would set aside half of the world’s area for wildlife and nature and keep the other half for human needs. If that sounds crazy, think of it this way: half the Earth would go towards the immediate needs of one species while the other half would go to the other 10 or so million.

“It’s been in my mind for years that people haven’t been thinking big enough — even conservationists,” Wilson told Smithsonian magazine last year (he published a book on the idea last month). “Half Earth is the goal, but it’s how we get there, and whether we can come up with a system of wild landscapes we can hang onto. I see a chain of uninterrupted corridors forming, with twists and turns, some of them opening up to become wide enough to accommodate national biodiversity parks, a new kind of park that won’t let species vanish.”

If the world managed to protect half of nature (a task that would require much restoration and rewildling), proponents argue it would go a long way — maybe the whole way — toward preserving the ecosystem services humans need. It would not solve issues like climate change and ocean acidification — though it would certainly help — but proponents argue that most other global environmental concerns would evaporate, especially the rising threat of mass extinction.

“Instead of abandoning protected areas we need more protected areas,” Weeden of the Weeden Foundation said.

He supports Nature Needs Half because, he said, “we need those…lofty goals.” He added that the target is achievable in many places. According to the World Bank, Venezuela and New Caledonia already had over half of their land in protected areas as of 2014. Bhutan had 47 percent; Zambia, Namibia, and Nicaragua 37 percent; Belize over 36 percent; and the Republic of the Congo 35 percent — and all of these are developing countries. In contrast, the U.S. has only protected 13.9 percent.

But could the globe’s growing human population thrive using just half the planet instead of damn near the whole thing? And would anyone, let alone global society, ever agree to such a thing? Critics of the plan have warned that Wilson’s big idea could result in the forcible removal of locals and indigenous groups, a problem that has plagued conservation for over a century-and-a-half. However, Wilson insisted to the New York Times that “this proposal does not mean moving anybody out.”

Weeden says science proves something more must be done. “Fifteen to 17 percent just isn’t enough in many areas to really protect against a continuing slide in biodiversity. You know, the end targets have just been mostly political and they’re not based on the science that says you need to be protecting a greater percentage of the Earth.”

Still, according to critics, big NGOs are paying less attention to scientists, at least conservation and biodiversity scientists, than ever before.

Goodbye scientists

Even as conservation groups have grown larger and wealthier, they have shrunk their teams of conservation scientists. In 2014, WWF-US dismantled its core science team, sending about half its 30 scientists to other teams and laying off the rest.

At the time, Thomas Brooks, the head of the Science and Knowledge Unit at the IUCN, told Science that he viewed WWF’s decision as “short-sighted” and “very bad news for science.”

But WWF’s move was only the latest among big conservation groups dropping key science staff. TNC also dismantled its core scientific program, the Natural Heritage Network, in 2000 by combining it with another NGO to create an independent group that is now called NatureServe but is no longer a part of TNC. And while CI began as a renegade group of TNC ecologists deciding to start up their own shop, today the organization retains few conservation scientists, according to observers.

This change isn’t just within the organizations, but also at the top. Of the biggest conservation organization’s five leaders (all men, of course), two have degrees in business instead of science. WWF-US’s CEO Carter Roberts, who took over in 2005, has a Master’s in business and worked for Procter & Gamble and Gillette before heading into conservation. WWF-International’s Director General, Marco Lambertini, earned a doctorate in chemistry and had a long career in conservation before getting his job. But it is Carter who is partly credited with the organization’s shift from wildlife and wild lands to partnering with industries and greening supply chains. Mark Tercek, TNC’s CEO since 2008, spent 24 years at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs — a corporate partner of TNC.

The CEO (and a co-founder) of CI, Peter Seligmann, has a Master’s in forestry and environmental science, but he is also credited with spearheading the group’s shift in focus from biodiversity to new conservation.

The loss of scientists — and science leaders — has resulted in groups failing at species conservation, according to Payne. “For reasons that I cannot fathom, the science and art of wildlife management essentially died by year 2000,” he said.

Instead of field conservation science, Payne sees “an irritating rise” of “technical gimmicks” and “pseudo-science.” He pointed to the groups’ attraction to intensive research efforts like sampling feces or the blood from leeches to determine if endangered species are present in an area.

“To what end?” he lamented. “If a species is so rare that such methods are contemplated, immediate drastic and targeted action…or simply giving up on the species, are likely the only two options.”

Payne said this was just one example of a prevailing “more research needed” syndrome. This often accompanies techno-heavy ideas that may make good PR, but often fizzle when applied, he said, and tends to come at the expense of training scientists to actually apply field research to save species on the ground.

WCS: an exception

One large conservation group, though, has maintained a sizeable army of conservation and field scientists throughout its ranks: WCS.

Of the four biggest conservation groups WCS is also the only one with a CEO, Cristián Samper, who has a PhD in biology. A renowned expert in tropical ecosystems, Samper is also the only one of the four CEOs who was not born and raised in the U.S. He grew up in Colombia and got his Bachelor’s degree at the University of the Andes in Bogotá.

Over and over again, conservationists told me that WCS stood apart from the rest in terms of using good science and effective conservation techniques and maintaining its focus on wildlife. Sure, some still complained about the group, but their complaints were largely nit-picks rather than takedowns of the group’s philosophy, approach, or effectiveness.

“At the end of the day, one has to come back to WCS’s record of long-term environmental leadership,” William Laurance, a conservation scientist at James Cook University in Australia recently told Mongabay. “Of the major international conservation groups, they’ve been among the most effective.”

WCS is unique in many ways. For one thing, it is the oldest of the big four (founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society). For another it is physically attached to three zoos and one aquarium in New York City, which its fans say enables it to stay grounded, stay connected to the public, and build a constituency for conservation in ways other groups cannot.

WCS has incorporated some elements of new conservation into its programs over the years, but unlike the other three groups, the new ideas have not shifted its overall focus.

“We just want to make sure that if a place or a species…does not perform a certain service to myself, [it] is not undervalued. I think that would be our main distinction [from other groups],” Joe Walston, WCS’s Vice President for Field Conservation Programs, told me.

Last fall WCS rolled out a new strategic plan. But unlike many shifts at big conservation groups, this one still emphasizes wildlife. Dubbed the 2020 Strategy, WCS aims to protect 15 priority regions across the world to, it says, safeguard half the world’s biodiversity.

“We cannot fail in efforts to convince people that the future can be different than the current gloom and doom narrative; we can reverse the decline of biodiversity,” Samper, the group’s head, told Mongabay in October. “We are living through the most important period for conservation. The pressures on nature are building as poverty declines and the middle class grows — prompting more consumerism, which leads to an unprecedented degradation of nature. You can see why it might be hard to spark optimism. But it is important to realize that as more people emerge out of poverty and more move into the cities, we feel there will be more interest and investment in conserving nature.”

In this context, Walston said protected areas are more relevant than ever, providing safe havens during transitional economic phases in developing countries. Yet in Borneo WWF has replaced the protected area strategy with something it calls “sustainable management.”

The broken heart of Borneo

Borneo, one of the most biodiverse landscapes on the planet, is in ecological crisis. The Bornean rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni) — a subspecies of the Sumatran — is on the knife’s edge of extinction; less than 2,000 Bornean pygmy elephants (Elephas maximus borneensis) survive; and the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), distinct from the great ape in Sumatra, is being killed by people at a rate as high 4,000 a year. For the possibly hundreds of thousands of other species living on the island much less is known, but their homes — their forests — are falling at one of the highest rates in the world.

It’s been six years since I visited Borneo and first heard about WWF’s landmark project there. But what has the much-touted Heart of Borneo program accomplished since?

In 2014, WWF released a status report on the program. It found that conversion of forest to oil palm, timber, or mining “continues to occur at rather high rates” in the Heart of Borneo even though this region is far less threatened than areas outside of it.

Details for the program were mixed. For example, the report found that the Heart of Borneo was still losing its forests at an annual rate of 2.19 percent. While incredibly high, it was still less than half the rate for the whole island. Bleakly, however, the report found that deforestation rates “are too high to be able reach the conservation goals” for lowland rainforest, heath forest, and “many of the other ecosystems.” Already, the program had woefully missed its target on heath forests: only 25 percent remained in 2012 despite a goal of 61 to 80 percent.

“I don’t think Heart of Borneo has achieved anything on the ground yet,” Erik Meijaard, an ecologist and director of the Brunei-based NGO Borneo Futures, told me. This, even though it’s been 10 years since the three Borneo nations — Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia — pledged to safeguard the Heart of Borneo.

WWF’s goal was never to protect all of the Heart of Borneo in one vast park, but to create a so-called sustainably managed landscape. By 2012, 58 percent of the Heart of Borneo was run by industry. Oil palm and timber plantations covered 9 percent, mining 18 percent, and logging concessions nearly a third.

Yet in the same year, only 20 percent of logging concessions in the Heart of Borneo were environmentally certified and not a single oil-palm plantation had achieved certification from the RSPO.

“If sustainable management of forests within the Heart of Borneo is the goal then I would have expected at least some changes in land-use planning…but so far I have not seen that,” said Meijaard.

Henry Chan, WWF’s Heart of Borneo leader, defended the program, telling me it has made “much progress.” He pointed to new conservation areas, including transboundary parks between Malaysia and Indonesia (12.6 percent of the Heart of Borneo is protected). He also said more forests were being certified under FSC. Finally, Chan pointed to programs to aid the Bornean elephant and rhino.

In the rhino’s case, however, only 15 or so individuals survive in the wild of Borneo, despite WWF’s original goal to safeguard 50 to 220. Moreover, WWF has come under intense criticism for its management of the wild rhinos, including a very public announcement of the population in 2013 (which critics said would only draw poachers) and the recent death of a female while in the care of WWF staff.

Still, the Heart of Borneo was never really WWF’s baby, according to Chan. “The initiative has always been driven by the three governments,” he said. But the only really bold move made by a government to date was when Brunei, which covers just 1 percent of the island, turned all of its production forests into conservation areas.

While WWF may want to distance itself from the program, and, rightly, put pressure on the governments, it doesn’t change the fact that the Heart of Borneo program remains WWF’s flagship mission on the island. And, according to Chan, WWF is the governments’ “most active partner.”

In a 2015 paper in Nature Communications, scientists compared the likely outcome of various conservation scenarios in Borneo. If the Heart of Borneo were ever fully implemented, the paper found that it would keep around half the island’s forests standing. However, many of these forests would be logged and the majority of orangutan and elephant habitat would be left totally unprotected.

A better path forward, according to the paper, would be collaboration across all three countries to achieve specific policies and biodiversity targets, including conservation of every major vegetation type. In other words, an approach that considered the whole island, instead of just the less-threatened highlands that characterize the Heart of Borneo.

Marc Ancrenaz, a co-author of the paper and the head of the local NGO HUTAN, told me that the Heart of Borneo was “an excellent strategy to raise funds and to self-promote,” but that the success of the whole program rested on wholly voluntary actions by governments. “In a nutshell, you have a potentially very interesting tool with no teeth!”

Here again rises a common criticism of many new conservation strategies: while they are often ambitious and inclusive, critics contend that lack of enforcement and follow-through often results in failure.

Cynthia Ong, the founder and CEO of the Malaysia-based organization LEAP (Land Empowerment Animals People), had a bit more positive spin on the program.

“[It] has succeeded in rallying state governments on the island of Borneo to coalesce around the core area of Borneo,” she said, adding, “I prefer to see and build on the positives of something rather than to dwell on the negatives.”

Still, Ong thinks WWF may have taken the wrong approach on the project from the beginning. “I would have framed Heart of Borneo as a movement and one that is self-organizing, rather than a program to be managed,” she said, noting that given the sheer size of the plan “‘management’ will always be an impossible task.”

But things only got worse in the Heart of Borneo, and across the island, last year. Every dry season, local farmers and companies burn forests in Indonesia to clear vegetation because fire is cheap. Last year’s burning season was one of the worst on record: 2.1 million hectares (over 8,000 square miles), an area the size of New Jersey, went up in smoke.

“With the biggest environmental disaster of the twenty-first century unfolding as we speak, Heart of Borneo clearly hasn’t done enough,” said Meijaard.

When it comes to the Heart of Borneo, WWF seems to have lost its way somewhere, say its critics. Perhaps the plan was too grandiose to succeed. Perhaps the focus on influencing powerful and entrenched industries through behind-the-scenes influence proved a red herring. Or perhaps WWF was simply more committed to selling the idea to governments and donors than to actually implementing it. Whatever the case, the Heart of Borneo appears to be on life-support today.

While it’s difficult to find good analyses of many of the world’s big conservation programs, the Heart of Borneo does not appear to be an isolated case. A 2015 report by USAID on a project it funded of WWF-US called Conservation and Adaptation in Asia’s High Mountains Landscapes and Communities (AHM) uncovered deep levels of mismanagement. Like the Heart of Borneo, AHM is a massive, transnational program. It aims to help communities in snow leopard (Panthera uncial) territories by working with them on water issues, climate change, and resource use.

According to the report, the program “urgently needs a reboot.” It criticizes AHM for failing to bring in local WWF offices across the six countries involved, for wholly ignoring other snow leopard conservation programs, and for micromanaging from Washington, D.C.

USAID gave WWF-US a D for management and a D for communications and information sharing. It also warned that funding issues were beginning to erode the project’s efficacy and credibility.

But WWF isn’t the only group to struggle over some of its programs. One of the most egregious examples in recent memory is CI’s work to improve marine biodiversity through collaborating with local communities in Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea, in 2006. The UN Development Program found that CI had significantly mismanaged its $6 million budget, leading it to run through funds a year early (CI denied this). But the group’s relationship with locals proved just as messy: it ran afoul of the local governor over financial concerns and accusations of elitism and arrogance. At one point he ordered all CI employees out of the area and even locked them out of their offices.

Of course, this doesn’t mean every new conservation project fails at big groups like WWF, CI, or TNC. However, critics at least anecdotally implied repeatedly that new conservation faced greater trials and a generally lower success rate than programs that involved a more traditional focus and a clearer set of goals, such as protect this water body or boost this animal’s population. Critics also argued that small groups generally have a better track record because they are more knowledgeable about local communities and more aware of issues that could trip up success.

Detente?

“It’s not tension. It’s bewilderment,” said Paul Salaman, the CEO of Rainforest Trust, when I asked him about the tension between traditionalists and new conservationists. The Rainforest Trust largely practices traditional conservation by establishing protected areas both large and small in tropical countries.

“Seriously, I understand that we want to look at different strategies,” he said, but new conservation is “not really targeting the wildlife that needs help…it’s certainly not a huge help for international conservation. I think, unfortunately, at best, it’s proven to be a bit of a distraction.”

Still, others view the whole discussion about new conservation versus old as the real distraction.

“[The debate] has taken a lot of attention from much more important issues and part of that is because the issues that we face….are so great that we really can’t afford to be spending time worrying about is one organization taking the right approach,” said Turner of CI.

Andrew Terry, head of conservation programs at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, a traditional conservation organization focused on saving gravely endangered species, agreed that the debate itself had become problematic.

“It implies a schism within the conservation field. I personally think this is a slightly false distinction that distracts us from the real discussions in conservation.”

He compared the best conservationists to magpies, willing to apply any tool from across various fields — basically having a whatever-it-takes attitude.

“This is what keeps conservation exciting and relevant,” he noted. “But at the same time, we need to make sure that this does not come at the expense of tried and tested approaches, and that they retain their place in the ever-expanding toolbox.”

The vitriolic nature of the debate has died down a little in recent years, perhaps out of sheer exhaustion. New conservationists have been quick to say that they never meant to disparage the work that has gone before or that parks don’t matter. For their part, some traditionalists are employing “new” methods piecemeal in their work if they seem useful in a given situation. And they sometimes concede that the goals of both philosophies are broadly the same, even if the two camps want to take different routes to get there.

But while the new-versus-traditional debate may be cooling, criticism of the biggest of the big conservation NGOs for their perceived clumsiness, bureaucracy, and ineffectiveness is not.

Conservation work has never been easy and as environmental threats have multiplied and globalized, it’s only gotten messier. Conservationists often have to navigate local skepticism, government ambivalence, business animosity, and competition with other NGOs. They have to battle whole political philosophies that treat the environment not as something to be valued and protected, but simply a roadblock to endless economic growth And they have to convince an inherently short-sighted species — Homo sapiens — to think in the long-term, to think indeed of generations long after they are gone. It’s an uphill, rain-swept, mud-splattered battle everyday.

“You could easily get disheartened and think, ‘God, you know, I’d rather be an accountant,’” said Salaman. But he added that when he sees the species his group has helped, he feels it is “making a difference.”

Salaman concluded that “we’re all in this together and we’re all doing our best, so you know…”

Indeed, every day thousands of conservationists get up around the world and devote the majority of their waking hours to a cause that can prove debilitating, frustrating, trying, and certainly not financially rewarding. They are facing down mass extinction, ecological Armageddon for our children, with finite resources. So their intense focus on approach and efficacy is not only understandable, but vital. There’s not a single conservationist on the planet who thinks, “Yes, we’re doing enough.”

But we can still ask: is what we’re doing working? Are we changing hearts and minds? Are we fighting the good fight? Will species be alive tomorrow that wouldn’t be here if not for our efforts? Or have we somehow lost our way — did we go astray somewhere — and if so how do we get back on track? After all, life is at stake.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Leo Bottrill worked with park authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as an employee of WWF. In fact, he worked with park authorities in Vietnam as an employee of a different conservation NGO. A previous version of this story erroneously stated that Will Turner was with Conservation International’s ocean’s division. We regret the errors.

Neither side of the debate disagrees that conservation today is failing to adequately halt mass extinction. But how to proceed is where talks break down, especially when it comes to the importance of protected areas and the efficacy of the biggest, most recognizable groups.

Conservation, Divided is an in-depth four-part series investigating how the field of conservation has changed over the last 30 years — and the challenges it faces moving into an uncertain future. Hance completed the series over the course of eight months. Stories will run weekly through May 17.

A few months after I began working full time as an environmental journalist in 2009, I found myself in Malaysian Borneo. I spent a day with a small group of conservationists and officials driving through a seemingly endless expanse of oil palm before coming to the lower Kinabatangan River. There, Borneo’s famous wildlife — orangutans, elephants, sun bears, and clouded leopards — was squeezed into ever-shrinking pockets of habitat in the Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary.

Frankly, after the miles of oil palm it was hard to imagine anything bigger than a house cat surviving there, let alone herds of elephants. That night, we met informally with some World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) staff at a local guesthouse. They excitedly explained the ambitious plan of the world’s most recognizable conservation group to preserve wildlife in Borneo from an unprecedented onslaught of logging, mining, and oil palm.

They handed me a glossy booklet filled with gorgeous photographs of charismatic Bornean wildlife frolicking and local people looking happy. Dubbed the Heart of Borneo project, WWF along with the three governments on the island planned to safeguard a region spreading over 23 million hectares and owned by three countries. The plan wasn’t to turn the area — larger than Great Britain — into a park, but instead into a sustainably managed landscape, something decidedly novel that involved partnering with the palm oil, logging, and mining industries to achieve. It would be a place, they claimed, where wildlife and indigenous groups could thrive. A big chunk of Borneo might just remain ecologically whole.

It sounded like a grand, ambitious, lovely idea. And as they told me about it, the WWF staff seemed eager for me to look impressed.

But then I said, “Well, this all looks great, but how are you going to do it?”

Now, maybe I had put my foot on cultural norms in Malaysia, but I found that the same faces that had looked excited and eager only a moment earlier either stared at me blankly or avoided my gaze. No one said anything; no one had an answer.

Something seemed missing.

Bashing the big

One of the things you discover as an environmental journalist is just how quickly scientists and conservationists are happy to bash — off the record, of course — big conservation groups. These include four of the world’s largest wildlife and wild-lands-focused groups with a global footprint: WWF, Conservation International (CI), the Nature Conservancy (TNC), and at times, though to a much lesser extent, the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS). Together these four groups employ over ten thousand people in nearly a hundred countries and have a collective annual income of around $2 billion. In many parts of the world, if not most, one of these four groups is likely to be seen as the public face of conservation efforts.

Over the years former employees have regularly dished the dirt to me about missed opportunities, misplaced values, and projects that seemed to fail as often as they succeeded, while current employees often sounded like public relations officials speaking in staccato. Outside conservationists often complained that the big NGOs took credit for their hard work and bungled local relationships. The same concerns would come up repeatedly: an obsession with the organization’s brand at the expense of success, a corporate-mimicked hierarchy, cushy relationships with some of the world’s biggest environmentally destructive corporations, radio silence on so many environmental issues, and an inability to respond to crises that are appearing with ever-more regularity.

Now, it’s not exactly surprising that former employees would sometimes complain about their last job; or that some environmental programs, with all their complexities and in the face of so many pressures, would fail; or that small conservation NGOs might be jealous of bigger groups. But as time went by I became so accustomed to hearing how bad big conservation has become, that I found myself startled when a conservationist had nothing but good things to say about his former employer (WWF-Poland) over beers. It was a first.

As so many sources told similar stories over and over, I began to wonder: has something really gone wrong? Was this just to be expected in a highly competitive landscape full of idealistic and passionate characters facing down ecological catastrophe…or has big conservation gone astray?

To find answers, one has to go back some 30 years when conservationists began dabbling with a new philosophy.

The rise of “new conservation”

The biggest shift in conservation in recent times is the rise of something called “new conservation.” This change is the origin of some — but by no means all — of the criticism flung at big conservation today.

Since the beginnings of the modern conservation movement — often linked to the rise of national parks in the nineteenth century — conservation has been largely about setting aside tracts of land or water and developing ways to protect endangered species. While early conservation efforts were in part propelled by economic and human-oriented values (such as hunting and recreation), they also placed a major emphasis on saving nature for its intrinsic and spiritual worth.

“There is a love of wild nature in everybody, an ancient mother-love ever showing itself whether recognized or no, and however covered by cares and duties,” wrote John Muir, one of the great fathers of modern environmentalism.

Inspired by Muir and others, many environmentalists argued that whatever nature might be worth economically to humankind now or in the future, it possesses a deeper importance that can’t and shouldn’t be measured in dollar signs. We should protect nature not because it serves myriad human needs (even though it does), but because we have a moral duty to do so.

Yet in recent decades the pendulum has swung back toward viewing nature through a largely utilitarian lens. This is perhaps not surprising given the rise of global environmental threats like climate change, ocean acidification, overpopulation, pollution, and mass extinction — and the growing realization that these threats could actually unhinge the workings of human civilization and plunge millions, maybe billions, into misery.

But this shift also followed the rise of neoliberalism in the 1970s and 80s, a movement that espoused de-regulation, distrust in governments, and deepening trust (some might even say religious-like fanaticism) in free markets and private enterprise. Conservationists were not immune to such beliefs. Following this period, environmentalists took a page from economists in attempting to meticulously measure everything in nature for its economic worth today and even make guesses about tomorrow. How much is pollination worth? Carbon sequestration? Water filtration?

A wonderful vision took form: if we could only incorporate the dollar value of nature into our current economic system — and convince policy makers and business people to understand that unrecognized economic value — we could save the world. This economic-centric approach has come to be called “new conservation.”

New conservationists argue that past conservation efforts never fully comprehended or addressed the real causes of biodiversity loss.

Tom Dillon, Senior Vice President of Forests and Freshwater for World Wildlife Fund-US (part of WWF), told me that the “core” of new conservation is transforming the drivers of destruction to be more environmentally friendly.

So, the new philosophy largely turned to focus on lands and waters outside protected areas with attempts to green big industries like agriculture, logging, fisheries, and mining.

“Expanding agriculture is responsible for most of the world’s deforestation. Polluted runoff and fragmented ecosystems from poorly planned infrastructure, such as roads and dams, is a major threat to the world’s rivers. Understanding the magnitude of these threats has helped us in creating innovative approaches to addressing them,” Dillon said. “And that is the only way we will be able to protect the world’s wildlife.”

To address the drivers, new conservationists have built elaborate certification schemes (like the Forest Stewardship Council for wood products or the Marine Stewardship Council for seafood) in order to convince industry that self-regulation can lead to both higher profits and more secure natural resources. They have also crafted still-nascent “payment for ecosystem services” programs that seek to pay governments or landowners to keep environments intact (such as REDD+ for carbon sequestration in forests). And they have focused on anti-poverty or sustainable development programs as a way to counter environmental destruction by the world’s poorest. New conservationists have also partnered with all variety of industries and corporations, including some of the most destructive, in order to help them clean up — and in some cases, it seems, also to access their sizable donations.

New conservation quickly captured most of the big conservation groups. All the mega-international NGOs — WWF, CI, TNC, and to a lesser extent WCS — have incorporated elements of new conservation into their myriad projects. For example, while TNC focuses on traditional conservation in the U.S. by buying up land, its overseas projects are largely new-conservation oriented.

Dillon said that his group’s adoption of the new conservation ethos came from realizing just how bad things had gotten. He pointed to WWF’s Living Planet Report, which assesses the state of the natural world every two years.

“The [2014] report showed all indicators, from biodiversity to climate change, trending negatively,” Dillon said, noting that these reports, which began in 1998, have made WWF realize that “we had won some crucial, hard-fought battles, but we were losing the war. We knew we had to change.”

Although WWF started out dedicated to on-the-ground work to save target species, more and more of its programs have revolved around new conservation ideas in recent years. The Heart of Borneo is just one example. Still, Deon Nel, the Global Conservation Director with WWF, insists the primary focus of the group “will always be” wildlife.

But many outside observers disagree. One of them is John Payne, who spent nearly thirty years working at and with WWF – Malaysia. Today, he is the head of the Borneo Rhino Alliance, trying to save the subspecies from extinction. He told me that WWF has changed significantly over the last three decades. “WWF allocates rather small proportions of its funding to programs on individual species to prevent their extinction. This is a significant departure from [its] founding aim.”

Still, some traditional conservationists dispute that idea that there is anything really new about new conservation.

“There has absolutely not been a shift from nature-only to people-too. Conservation from its beginnings in the 1800s has always included human interest in its work, including both economic desires and harm from environmental degradation,” Kierán Suckling, Executive Director of the Tucson-based NGO Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), told me, pointing out that even John Muir was a farmer and rancher.

New conservationists have simply marketed their ideas as novel for self-promotion, he charged. “The first rule of selling widgets is that all widgets must be described as radically new and better,” said Suckling. “Otherwise no one will be interested in your widget. Don’t be fooled by the widget sellers.”

Suckling’s point is noteworthy, but what is certainly new is how many formerly wildlife-centric groups are now focused on the human and economic sides of nature. Traditional conservation has been “obviously…de-emphasized” within the biggest conservation groups, according to Leo Bottrill, who worked at WWF for six years and now heads Moabi, an initiative to map and monitor deforestation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

“There’s less money going into [traditional conservation]. There’s less support for it. There’s less capacity,” Bottrill said.

And, according to many of their critics, the big NGOs have gone too far.

Noga Shanee, co-founder of a small NGO in Peru called Neotropical Primate Conservation, says new conservation really should be called “neo-liberal conservation.” She dubs its activities “near-conservation actions” or “beating about the conservation bush.”

“There is so much effort, so much money, pouring into enormous projects that are not directly focused on conservation,” she told me.

She criticizes new conservation for being “full of paradoxes,” like forcing indigenous people to become farmers, selling off forests for cash, and supporting monoculture plantations. But — most egregiously in her mind — this type of conservation continues to push trophy hunting even when targeting Critically Endangered species like the black rhino (Diceros bicornis).

Asserting that often when local people hunt they are “poachers,” but when rich foreigners do so they are “conservationists,” Shanee added that new conservation groups “also sometimes change hunting to ecotourism, bioprospecting, or other less destructive activities, but the idea is basically the same, conservation is largely used as a justification for territorialism.”

According to critics like Shanee, new conservation’s focus on economics and drivers — at the expense of setting aside more wilderness areas or taking action to save species on the brink — is at best risky and at worst a red herring. They contend that new conservationists have traded in programs focusing directly on wildlife for ones that may or may not help endangered species. And that by dropping arguments about morality and values, new conservationists have essentially handed the argument to nature utilitarians: if the rabbit has no economic value, kill the rabbit. In today’s red in tooth and claw capitalism, nature must pay for itself.

A vigorous debate: parks and values

The debate over traditional versus new conservation has been vitriolic, impassioned, and at times downright ugly. Researchers, conservation workers, and journalists have fired slings and arrows in academic journals, in newspapers, at conferences, in blogs, and in person. Conservation thinkers have become divided.

Neither side disagrees that conservation today — both traditional and new — is failing to adequately halt mass extinction. But how to proceed is where talks break down, especially when it comes to the importance of protected areas.

Proponents of traditional conservation view protected areas as conservation’s biggest success in the last 150 years. They argue that conservationists should urgently focus on creating more of them, as well as increasing on-the-ground efforts to save on-the-brink species.

Protected areas currently cover about 12 to 15 percent of land and 3 percent of the oceans, though they are steadily ratcheting up in the latter. Without them, proponents argue, the extinction crisis would be orders of magnitude worse, with countless species having gone extinct that are still here today. Indeed, research in the past few years has backed that up by showing that protected areas house more biodiversity and in greater abundance than adjacent areas.

But proponents of new conservation say this approach is insufficient. “We are convinced that protected areas alone are not enough,” writes Michelle Marvier, an environmental scientist at Santa Clara University, in a 2013 editorial in Conservation Biology with the unwavering title “New Conservation Is True Conservation.” She compares the call for more protected areas to the call for more hospital beds during the AIDS crisis — in other words reactive rather proactive, a Band-Aid over a gaping wound. “Despite great successes in the establishment of protected areas, the rate of species extinction remains unacceptably high,” she writes.

New conservationists have also attacked the idea that there is really any pristine place left in the world, with the implication that preserving wilderness in some pre-human state should no longer be the goal. Instead, we should find a way to live with nature that supports the seven-billion-and-rising people on the planet.

“I think most conservationists would say ‘yes,’ that’s absolutely right, and that’s what we’re fighting against,” Don Weeden told me, referring to the idea that nothing is pristine. Weeden directs the Bedford Hills, New York-based Weeden Foundation, which supports mainly traditional conservation projects around the world. “Certainly any wilderness area will be compromised, but what we’re trying to do is basically save the best of what’s left,” he said.

One of the reasons why the traditional versus new debate has hit such a nerve is because it touches wholly sensitive places like one’s values and morals. New conservationists contend that traditionalists have not put enough value on human needs and economic requirements. But for their part, traditionalists believe new conservationists have lost sight of nature’s intrinsic value — of the ethical imperative that a species has every right to exist regardless of any benefits (or lack thereof) it may provide humanity. Traditionalists fear that once we have to have an economic value attached to a place or a species, we will begin to lose many of both.

What if we discover that the Critically Endangered Bale Mountains treefrog (Balebreviceps hillmani) is worth just $15 in Ethiopia a year as a research curiosity? Or that the northern sportive lemur (Lepilemur septentrionalis) is worth just $150 in tourism revenue a year to Madagascar, whereas replacing its habitat with crops could yield significantly more for the local community?

Yet new conservationists contend that this is the wrong way to look at it: ecosystems like forests provide multiple benefits for people — carbon and water filtration, in addition to biodiversity — that add up economically.

In pushing the economic value of nature, new conservationists say they are also simply responding to polls showing that declining numbers of the public view themselves as environmentalists or conservationists (at least in the U.S.), as well as looking for practical ways to convince governments and corporations that environmental action need not come as a threat to neo-liberal capitalism as it is currently practiced.

“For me personally, I love nature,” Will Turner, senior vice president and chief scientist with CI, told me. “I love biodiversity. I also love people. And I think I’m entirely comfortable with having a value system that includes both the intrinsic value of nature… [and] the foundational importance of ecosystems on this planet for human survival and prosperity.”

Wherever the balance lies, new conservation has birthed truly novel programs that its proponents contend could go a long way toward really saving nature.

Are certification schemes worth it?

Go to an upscale grocery store and you might notice a profusion of stamps: there’s the blue, fishy Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) stamp, the green palm frond stamp from the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), the check-marked tree from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), and the frog stamp from the Rainforest Alliance. This is one of the fruits of new conservation: rapidly multiplying, sometimes competing certification schemes that attempt to control the drivers of environmental destruction by steering consumer dollars toward more sustainable products. Big conservation groups have been instrumental in creating and shaping many of these schemes.

Critics say such certification schemes give consumers the false impression that somehow the product they buy doesn’t harm the environment, when in fact, at best, it only lessens the damage done. For example, FSC-certified paper is likely a better purchase than non-certified paper, but it’s not in any way better than simply forgoing paper in the first place or choosing 100-percent recycled. The devil is in the details — and the details of each certification scheme can be complex and opaque.

Watchdog NGOs have accused certification schemes of having poor standards and lax enforcement and of being too influenced by the industries they are supposed to rein-in. For example, environmental critics call certain of FSC’s standards unsustainable, such as its permission of logging in primary forests, monoculture tree plantations, and even clearcutting in some cases. FSC products are also often designated as “FSC Mix,” which can mean they contain only a percentage of FSC-certified material, while the rest is “Controlled Wood” that meets certain minimal standards but does not follow more stringent rules required for FSC certification.

Part of the reason such allowances arise is because certification schemes are not designed solely by the big NGOs, but are the result of often hard-fought compromises and back-door meetings between NGOs, companies and industry groups, governments, and other “stakeholders.” Certification schemes are also only as good as the auditors that inspect the operations (usually only once a year), but many have run into trouble for having shoddy and even corrupt auditing — most recently the RSPO.

Despite such concerns, Dillon with WWF said that the amount of land certified by the FSC was one of WWF’s biggest organizational successes in the last 20 years. WWF helped create the FSC in 1993 and remains a member and staunch supporter today. Dillon pointed out that 15.5 percent of the world’s production forests are currently certified by FSC, an area larger than Iran spanning more than 182 million hectares. He also said that the FSC’s standards are improving: in 2014, the council strengthened protections in “Intact Forest Landscapes,” large areas of primary forest that haven’t been cut by roads or other infrastructure.

“WWF believes the FSC has the most rigorous forest management standards for environmental and social responsibility,” said Dillon. “We also believe that obtaining FSC certification and sourcing FSC-certified products is one of the best approaches to conserving the world’s forests.”

But critics say that in its 20-plus years, the FSC has done little to protect the world’s most biodiverse forests. In 2013, only 19 million hectares of FSC-certified forest (about 10 percent of the FSC’s total) were located in the tropics — and a quarter of these were monoculture plantations, which have very little biodiversity value. The FSC has certified four times more forest in Europe than in all of the world’s tropical countries. If the point of the FSC was to help protect wildlife, to date it has largely missed the world’s most wildlife-rich landscapes — and those, of course, with the most threatened species.

Yet even some traditional conservationists view certification schemes as a useful way of responding to the global environmental crisis.

Payne of the Borneo Rhino Alliance, a member of the RSPO, says the palm-oil certification scheme provides a positive course in the absence of more protected areas by making “environmental standards transparent and mandatory for members.” The fact that governments often try to “meddle” in the process proves the RSPO’s worth, he said.

In Payne’s view, governments are holding too tightly on the reins of wildlife conservation while certification schemes like the RSPO return some power to NGOs.

But Jennifer Jacquet, an environmental studies professor at New York University, says governments need more responsibility not less. She critiqued certification schemes in her 2015 book Is Shame Necessary? by arguing that they move responsibility for environmental health from the government, which can make large-scale and comprehensive changes, to the purchasing public, which can only make hodgepodge and arguably slight changes. Many companies can still get away with environmental destruction, since there will always be consumers willing to buy their products as long as they can pay less. For example, while RSPO certification may prove successful for a percentage of products sold in Europe and America, the bulk of the world’s palm oil is actually consumed by China, India, and Indonesia — where such schemes currently don’t look very promising.

“Most certification schemes have had a marginal effect on ecology, sucked up major amounts of conservation funding, and, as I argue, have been a major distraction from making bigger, blanket changes,” Jacquet told Mongabay in an interview last year. She noted that the MSC only covers 7 percent of the global seafood market.

But proponents of certification schemes argue that they take time to really begin to make a difference and that they have already succeeded in improving the environmental impacts of some industries, if only partially and in specific regions.

Still, critics say all the effort expended on these schemes would have been better spent on convincing individual governments and the international community to improve regulations across the board. In the end, they say, what’s needed is not the multiplication of voluntary schemes dependent on consumer awareness, but better, stronger regulation ensuring that all the fish at sushi counters, all the wood at Home Depot, all the palm oil at Wal-Mart are sustainably sourced.

Can ecosystems pay for themselves?

However controversial certification schemes may be, they have been wildly successful in bringing big conservation and industry together to wrestle with difficult problems. Whether they will end up being wholly transformative remains to be seen. An even more difficult baby of new conservation, however, has been the dream of getting the market and governments to recognize the economic value of what has come to be known as ecosystem services, or in layman’s terms the free stuff nature gives us, like clean water, oxygen, carbon sequestration, and pollination.

New conservationists have used research on ecosystem services to try to convince governments to protect important environments like watersheds, mangroves, and forests. They have also crafted new programs, known as “payment for ecosystem services programs,” based on the idea that governments or corporations would actually pay outright to protect such services. But to date, such programs, like the U.N.’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+), have struggled to get off the ground. For example, REDD+ proposes that wealthy countries pay poor countries to keep their forests standing for the carbon they sequester. But most of the program’s life, which began officially in 2008, has been taken up by negotiations. Roadblocks have included trouble with indigenous groups who view it as a new form of forest-grabbing, lack of support from local governments, and difficulty raising the required funds. It remains to be seen whether the Paris Agreement will give it a much-needed shot in the arm.

Critics say that payment for ecosystem service programs have promised more than they can shell out. For example, they contend that really no monetary calculation of a forest’s services can compete with something as lucrative as an oil-palm plantation or a mine for highly desirable minerals.

But Turner with CI noted that there are cases where ecosystem services can already compete, especially when one includes the full range of services, instead of focusing on just one, like REDD+ does with carbon sequestration.

“I think mangroves are great example of this… There have been various studies comparing the value of mangrove ecosystems relative to the most profitable alternative use,” he said. Mangroves provide nurseries for fisheries, carbon sequestration, and non-timber forest products for locals. They also buffer against storm surges, which means mangroves actually save lives. “And you add those up and it’s much more valuable than the sort of near-term profits from conversion to shrimp aquaculture,” Turner said.

Mangroves may indeed be worth much more standing than shrimp aquaculture, but that hasn’t stopped them from being destroyed around the world at record rates. Between 1990 and 2005, the world lost somewhere between 19 and 35 percent of its mangroves. Experts say that mangroves have fallen at a rate of three-to-five times faster than forests on land, imperiling not just biodiversity but human lives. In other words, even when policy makers know an ecosystem is worth more standing they don’t always protect it — at least not yet.

Turner admitted there are also cases where exploitation trumps ecosystems economically. Mining is one. “You are never going to be able to put a value on those few square acres around the mine site as of greater economic value to people than the millions of dollars in minerals,” he said, adding that in such cases it’s important to reduce the overall destruction as much as possible. Of course, the impacts of mining go far beyond the immediate area destroyed, such as pollution leaking into the water table and rising into the air, as well as additional infrastructure like roads to bring minerals to the market.

Another factor complicating the payment for ecosystem services approach is that uncertainties stack up when trying to measure ecosystem services. For one thing, as climate change worsens there is the potential for carbon sequestration to become more valuable. And the same could be said of many services in an age of environmental loss, such as clean water and pollination.

This kind of potential future worth that doesn’t end up on the balance sheet today should still be considered, said Turner, who pointed to rainforests as storehouses for undiscovered drugs.

“My father got a multiple drug-resistant infection two years ago [and] nearly died. The compound that saved him was vancomycin, one of these antibiotics of last resort, that it turns out was collected on an expedition funded by Eli Lilly fifty years ago in Borneo,” said Turner. “This rainforest compound literally on the other side of the planet from my father, fifty years in the future…saved his life. Meanwhile, that forest today is cleaning water and providing water and supporting the fisheries that people…depend on very directly right now.”

Turner said that identifying a wide range of ecosystem services also allows conservationists to expand the number of institutions and people involved in conservation, and to make the case for conservation to a broader audience.

But Payne of the Borneo Rhino Alliance argued that focusing on ecosystem services has left wildlife adrift. “What is not sensible is to argue for economic reasons to protect species when no economic arguments exist…[Conservationists] not only have to make up potentially spurious arguments, but people in general start to believe that nature conservation has to be linked to economics,” he said. “[T]he ‘new conservation’ approach is normally too generic to save any endangered species, except by luck.”

For example, even assuming that estimating a value for an ecosystem’s services results in setting land aside, Payne said that doesn’t necessarily mean the species living there will be protected. Wildlife is facing a rising barrage of threats beyond habitat loss, including wildlife trade and climate change. Many species will still require on-the-ground efforts to make it through the next hundred years, even if their habitat remains. But this is exactly the kind of work that has fallen by the wayside in the age of new conservation.

“There’s no substitution for working directly with park authorities…to implement conservation programs,” said Bottrill of Moabi, who spent several years doing just that earlier in his conservation career.

He added, “[You] still need to learn about species and how you manage and maintain them. These problems haven’t gone away.” Bottrill pointed to the catastrophic bushmeat trade in Africa as a glaring sign of the need for more conservation boots on the ground, not fewer.

The bottom line for critics is that the ecosystem services approach is just another way that new conservation has moved away from directly protecting endangered species, even as threats multiply and populations plunge.

The unmeasurables?

If you’re working on saving the Amur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica) from extinction it’s relatively straightforward to tell if your project is working: simply count the population and see if it’s declining, rising, or stable. One of the strongest, most persistent criticisms of new conservation is that it’s far more difficult to measure success or failure when it comes to how ecosystem services, certification schemes, anti-poverty programs, or aligning with industries are actually helping wildlife.

“[Funds] have been spent over many years on the new conservation approach without measurable outputs. This approach is commonly just that: an approach without clear goals,” said Payne. “Success or failure is subjective.”

Traditional conservationists will tell you that measuring biodiversity — as opposed to just a single species — can itself prove problematic, but measuring the impact of a certification or payment for ecosystem services program on biodiversity muddies things further. In fact, even though new conservation has been around for decades, critics say groups have been reluctant to commission hard research to see if their programs are living up to the hype.

Suzanne Apple, WWF-US’s Senior Vice President of Private Sector Engagement, admitted that credibly measuring success is something conservation in general could improve. But she said WWF is working on it.

“We’ve learned through experience that we need to link our conservation work to hard numbers so that we can better understand where we’re making progress and where we might need to change course,” she said. “WWF has taken steps toward a clearer strategy…and we have incorporated measuring and evaluation into our planning processes.“

A lack of good research on the efficacy of new conservation programs means that many groups are still in the dark about how well their programs work. Surprisingly, there have been few comprehensive studies looking at whether FSC-certified logging operations have actually prevented deforestation or protected biodiversity, even though FSC has been around for nearly a quarter century. But a 2015 study in PLOS ONE evaluating logging concessions in Indonesian Borneo found that FSC-certified operations did decrease deforestation — but only by 5 percent compared to non-certified forests. The study also found that FSC-certified forests had no impact on the outbreak of fires or on the fragmentation of forests’ core areas, one proxy for biodiversity. On the other hand, the study found that villages in FSC-certified forests were better off by various measures. “The actual impact is negligible…there are some benefit[s] but it’s not that much better than the alternative,” concluded Bottrill of the research in Indonesian Borneo.

However another recent study in Chile found that FSC-certified plantations reduced deforestation by 43 percent and bested other sustainability schemes in the area. But, even here, the goal was to reduce deforestation to zero, so while FSC fared better in Chile’s temperate forests than in Kalimantan’s rainforests, it still missed its overall mark.

At the same time, Shanee of Neotropical Primate Conservation said that new conservation groups dwell in a “culture of reproducing super success stories” even when there is no evidence of success. “It always seems to surprise everyone that with all these excellent conservation efforts, species keep being wiped out.”

For Nel of WWF, comparing outcomes of traditional and new conservation is like comparing apples and oranges for one important reason: timeframe. Nel noted that establishing protected areas results in rapid outcomes. But when you target the drivers of environmental problems through a certification scheme or payment for ecosystem services program it takes longer to know if your effort was successful.

Nel said conservation today needs to learn to “play the long game” if it’s going to tackle the forces behind environmental degradation, such as industries, markets, and consumption patterns. And so the very nature of WWF’s work today means a scale of ambition unseen in conservation just a few decades ago.

“These aren’t immediate fixes as when you’re working very close to the ground,” he said.

Too big to succeed?

But Nel’s point begs the question: has the ambition of conservation groups outstripped their abilities? Has their size, which ballooned in recent decades, become more of a liability than a strength? Or is this the only way to tackle mounting environmental crises that now crisscross national borders and permeate all levels of society?

The two really big fish here are TNC and WWF, which brought in $949 million and $700 million respectively in 2014. WCS brought in $253 million and CI brought in $152 million that year, making them small compared to the other two, but still giants next to most conservation groups.

TNC employs around 3,500 and works in more than 30 countries, though it focuses heavily on the U.S. WWF employs 6,000 people and works in some 100 countries and has 5 million supporters around the world. WCS employs 4,000 people around the world. CI employs 800 people in 30 countries. Even as WWF and TNC are Earth’s conservation juggernauts, they are far overshadowed by dozens of other charities, such as United Way or the Salvation Army.

Conservation groups remain underdogs in the nonprofit world and have problems that nonprofits geared toward human welfare do not. Conservation groups not only have to work to protect nature, but also have to convince governments and society of the importance of the environment and its millions of species. Humans rarely need to be convinced of the importance of humans.

But critics say big conservation’s very expansiveness has tended to make it less nimble, more bureaucratic, less adaptable — in short, less efficient and effective. Today, large conservation NGOs often commit themselves to long-term programs, making U-turns nearly impossible and making it difficult for them to respond to conservation crises with funds or expertise, according to many sources. Critics argue, for instance, that big conservation groups have dropped the ball on, and maybe even exacerbated, the bushmeat-poaching frenzy taking place in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America by turning their focus away from endangered species.

Big conservation is further hampered by an ossifying hierarchy that is steeped in bureaucracy, according to its many critics, who say new ideas from lower-level employees are stifled before they can rise to the top, along with their concerns. I don’t know how many times I’ve heard the story of a new employee coming into a major conservation group excited and passionate, only to become disillusioned and frustrated over time — and often fearing to speak out.

All this has made it almost impossible for hard-working conservationists to take the kind of bold action necessary to save species on the edge of extinction, according to sources. Some traditional conservationists even suggested that the big groups could achieve more by partnering with top conservationists, which was the way WWF operated from the 1960s to the 1980s, and then granting them considerable freedom.

This is the sort of model that the one group, San Francisco-based Wildlife Conservation Network (WCN), has undertaken. WCN assists conservationists around the globe with fundraising, publicity, and scaling up their work, without imposing additional bureaucracy.

“We exist to support their brands, not ours,” Jefe Parrish, WCN’s Vice President for Conservation and a former WWF employee, told me. A common criticism of big NGOs, on the other hand, is that they tend to swallow up, and even take credit for, the work of smaller groups.

Parrish noted that WCN was able to launch an ambitious initiative called the Elephant Crisis Fund after a discussion that lasted only a day, whereas making that kind of decision at a mega-NGO could drag on for a year. Characteristics such as innovation, speed, nimbleness, and collaborativeness are not easily found at any of the big NGOs, Parrish said.

Still, being big isn’t all bad. WWF has “immense convening power,” according to former employee Bottrill. It may take the group a long time to get behind something due to reputational concerns, “but when it did, it could be a force to be reckoned with,” he said. No one likes an angry panda.

Few, if any, conservation experts would disagree with the need for the kind of large-scale transformational change the conservation giants are aiming for. But some do still question whether these groups are the right institutions to take this on, are really capable of transforming global markets and governments at the scale needed, or are employing the right strategies.

An alternative vision of future conservation might be famed biologist E.O. Wilson’s Nature Needs Half initiative, according to contacts. The idea is that humanity would set aside half of the world’s area for wildlife and nature and keep the other half for human needs. If that sounds crazy, think of it this way: half the Earth would go towards the immediate needs of one species while the other half would go to the other 10 or so million.

“It’s been in my mind for years that people haven’t been thinking big enough — even conservationists,” Wilson told Smithsonian magazine last year (he published a book on the idea last month). “Half Earth is the goal, but it’s how we get there, and whether we can come up with a system of wild landscapes we can hang onto. I see a chain of uninterrupted corridors forming, with twists and turns, some of them opening up to become wide enough to accommodate national biodiversity parks, a new kind of park that won’t let species vanish.”

If the world managed to protect half of nature (a task that would require much restoration and rewildling), proponents argue it would go a long way — maybe the whole way — toward preserving the ecosystem services humans need. It would not solve issues like climate change and ocean acidification — though it would certainly help — but proponents argue that most other global environmental concerns would evaporate, especially the rising threat of mass extinction.

“Instead of abandoning protected areas we need more protected areas,” Weeden of the Weeden Foundation said.

He supports Nature Needs Half because, he said, “we need those…lofty goals.” He added that the target is achievable in many places. According to the World Bank, Venezuela and New Caledonia already had over half of their land in protected areas as of 2014. Bhutan had 47 percent; Zambia, Namibia, and Nicaragua 37 percent; Belize over 36 percent; and the Republic of the Congo 35 percent — and all of these are developing countries. In contrast, the U.S. has only protected 13.9 percent.

But could the globe’s growing human population thrive using just half the planet instead of damn near the whole thing? And would anyone, let alone global society, ever agree to such a thing? Critics of the plan have warned that Wilson’s big idea could result in the forcible removal of locals and indigenous groups, a problem that has plagued conservation for over a century-and-a-half. However, Wilson insisted to the New York Times that “this proposal does not mean moving anybody out.”

Weeden says science proves something more must be done. “Fifteen to 17 percent just isn’t enough in many areas to really protect against a continuing slide in biodiversity. You know, the end targets have just been mostly political and they’re not based on the science that says you need to be protecting a greater percentage of the Earth.”

Still, according to critics, big NGOs are paying less attention to scientists, at least conservation and biodiversity scientists, than ever before.

Goodbye scientists

Even as conservation groups have grown larger and wealthier, they have shrunk their teams of conservation scientists. In 2014, WWF-US dismantled its core science team, sending about half its 30 scientists to other teams and laying off the rest.

At the time, Thomas Brooks, the head of the Science and Knowledge Unit at the IUCN, told Science that he viewed WWF’s decision as “short-sighted” and “very bad news for science.”

But WWF’s move was only the latest among big conservation groups dropping key science staff. TNC also dismantled its core scientific program, the Natural Heritage Network, in 2000 by combining it with another NGO to create an independent group that is now called NatureServe but is no longer a part of TNC. And while CI began as a renegade group of TNC ecologists deciding to start up their own shop, today the organization retains few conservation scientists, according to observers.

This change isn’t just within the organizations, but also at the top. Of the biggest conservation organization’s five leaders (all men, of course), two have degrees in business instead of science. WWF-US’s CEO Carter Roberts, who took over in 2005, has a Master’s in business and worked for Procter & Gamble and Gillette before heading into conservation. WWF-International’s Director General, Marco Lambertini, earned a doctorate in chemistry and had a long career in conservation before getting his job. But it is Carter who is partly credited with the organization’s shift from wildlife and wild lands to partnering with industries and greening supply chains. Mark Tercek, TNC’s CEO since 2008, spent 24 years at investment banking giant Goldman Sachs — a corporate partner of TNC.

The CEO (and a co-founder) of CI, Peter Seligmann, has a Master’s in forestry and environmental science, but he is also credited with spearheading the group’s shift in focus from biodiversity to new conservation.

The loss of scientists — and science leaders — has resulted in groups failing at species conservation, according to Payne. “For reasons that I cannot fathom, the science and art of wildlife management essentially died by year 2000,” he said.

Instead of field conservation science, Payne sees “an irritating rise” of “technical gimmicks” and “pseudo-science.” He pointed to the groups’ attraction to intensive research efforts like sampling feces or the blood from leeches to determine if endangered species are present in an area.

“To what end?” he lamented. “If a species is so rare that such methods are contemplated, immediate drastic and targeted action…or simply giving up on the species, are likely the only two options.”

Payne said this was just one example of a prevailing “more research needed” syndrome. This often accompanies techno-heavy ideas that may make good PR, but often fizzle when applied, he said, and tends to come at the expense of training scientists to actually apply field research to save species on the ground.

WCS: an exception

One large conservation group, though, has maintained a sizeable army of conservation and field scientists throughout its ranks: WCS.

Of the four biggest conservation groups WCS is also the only one with a CEO, Cristián Samper, who has a PhD in biology. A renowned expert in tropical ecosystems, Samper is also the only one of the four CEOs who was not born and raised in the U.S. He grew up in Colombia and got his Bachelor’s degree at the University of the Andes in Bogotá.

Over and over again, conservationists told me that WCS stood apart from the rest in terms of using good science and effective conservation techniques and maintaining its focus on wildlife. Sure, some still complained about the group, but their complaints were largely nit-picks rather than takedowns of the group’s philosophy, approach, or effectiveness.

“At the end of the day, one has to come back to WCS’s record of long-term environmental leadership,” William Laurance, a conservation scientist at James Cook University in Australia recently told Mongabay. “Of the major international conservation groups, they’ve been among the most effective.”

WCS is unique in many ways. For one thing, it is the oldest of the big four (founded in 1895 as the New York Zoological Society). For another it is physically attached to three zoos and one aquarium in New York City, which its fans say enables it to stay grounded, stay connected to the public, and build a constituency for conservation in ways other groups cannot.

WCS has incorporated some elements of new conservation into its programs over the years, but unlike the other three groups, the new ideas have not shifted its overall focus.

“We just want to make sure that if a place or a species…does not perform a certain service to myself, [it] is not undervalued. I think that would be our main distinction [from other groups],” Joe Walston, WCS’s Vice President for Field Conservation Programs, told me.

Last fall WCS rolled out a new strategic plan. But unlike many shifts at big conservation groups, this one still emphasizes wildlife. Dubbed the 2020 Strategy, WCS aims to protect 15 priority regions across the world to, it says, safeguard half the world’s biodiversity.

“We cannot fail in efforts to convince people that the future can be different than the current gloom and doom narrative; we can reverse the decline of biodiversity,” Samper, the group’s head, told Mongabay in October. “We are living through the most important period for conservation. The pressures on nature are building as poverty declines and the middle class grows — prompting more consumerism, which leads to an unprecedented degradation of nature. You can see why it might be hard to spark optimism. But it is important to realize that as more people emerge out of poverty and more move into the cities, we feel there will be more interest and investment in conserving nature.”

In this context, Walston said protected areas are more relevant than ever, providing safe havens during transitional economic phases in developing countries. Yet in Borneo WWF has replaced the protected area strategy with something it calls “sustainable management.”

The broken heart of Borneo

Borneo, one of the most biodiverse landscapes on the planet, is in ecological crisis. The Bornean rhino (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis harrissoni) — a subspecies of the Sumatran — is on the knife’s edge of extinction; less than 2,000 Bornean pygmy elephants (Elephas maximus borneensis) survive; and the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus), distinct from the great ape in Sumatra, is being killed by people at a rate as high 4,000 a year. For the possibly hundreds of thousands of other species living on the island much less is known, but their homes — their forests — are falling at one of the highest rates in the world.

It’s been six years since I visited Borneo and first heard about WWF’s landmark project there. But what has the much-touted Heart of Borneo program accomplished since?

In 2014, WWF released a status report on the program. It found that conversion of forest to oil palm, timber, or mining “continues to occur at rather high rates” in the Heart of Borneo even though this region is far less threatened than areas outside of it.

Details for the program were mixed. For example, the report found that the Heart of Borneo was still losing its forests at an annual rate of 2.19 percent. While incredibly high, it was still less than half the rate for the whole island. Bleakly, however, the report found that deforestation rates “are too high to be able reach the conservation goals” for lowland rainforest, heath forest, and “many of the other ecosystems.” Already, the program had woefully missed its target on heath forests: only 25 percent remained in 2012 despite a goal of 61 to 80 percent.

“I don’t think Heart of Borneo has achieved anything on the ground yet,” Erik Meijaard, an ecologist and director of the Brunei-based NGO Borneo Futures, told me. This, even though it’s been 10 years since the three Borneo nations — Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia — pledged to safeguard the Heart of Borneo.

WWF’s goal was never to protect all of the Heart of Borneo in one vast park, but to create a so-called sustainably managed landscape. By 2012, 58 percent of the Heart of Borneo was run by industry. Oil palm and timber plantations covered 9 percent, mining 18 percent, and logging concessions nearly a third.

Yet in the same year, only 20 percent of logging concessions in the Heart of Borneo were environmentally certified and not a single oil-palm plantation had achieved certification from the RSPO.

“If sustainable management of forests within the Heart of Borneo is the goal then I would have expected at least some changes in land-use planning…but so far I have not seen that,” said Meijaard.

Henry Chan, WWF’s Heart of Borneo leader, defended the program, telling me it has made “much progress.” He pointed to new conservation areas, including transboundary parks between Malaysia and Indonesia (12.6 percent of the Heart of Borneo is protected). He also said more forests were being certified under FSC. Finally, Chan pointed to programs to aid the Bornean elephant and rhino.

In the rhino’s case, however, only 15 or so individuals survive in the wild of Borneo, despite WWF’s original goal to safeguard 50 to 220. Moreover, WWF has come under intense criticism for its management of the wild rhinos, including a very public announcement of the population in 2013 (which critics said would only draw poachers) and the recent death of a female while in the care of WWF staff.

Still, the Heart of Borneo was never really WWF’s baby, according to Chan. “The initiative has always been driven by the three governments,” he said. But the only really bold move made by a government to date was when Brunei, which covers just 1 percent of the island, turned all of its production forests into conservation areas.

While WWF may want to distance itself from the program, and, rightly, put pressure on the governments, it doesn’t change the fact that the Heart of Borneo program remains WWF’s flagship mission on the island. And, according to Chan, WWF is the governments’ “most active partner.”

In a 2015 paper in Nature Communications, scientists compared the likely outcome of various conservation scenarios in Borneo. If the Heart of Borneo were ever fully implemented, the paper found that it would keep around half the island’s forests standing. However, many of these forests would be logged and the majority of orangutan and elephant habitat would be left totally unprotected.

A better path forward, according to the paper, would be collaboration across all three countries to achieve specific policies and biodiversity targets, including conservation of every major vegetation type. In other words, an approach that considered the whole island, instead of just the less-threatened highlands that characterize the Heart of Borneo.

Marc Ancrenaz, a co-author of the paper and the head of the local NGO HUTAN, told me that the Heart of Borneo was “an excellent strategy to raise funds and to self-promote,” but that the success of the whole program rested on wholly voluntary actions by governments. “In a nutshell, you have a potentially very interesting tool with no teeth!”

Here again rises a common criticism of many new conservation strategies: while they are often ambitious and inclusive, critics contend that lack of enforcement and follow-through often results in failure.

Cynthia Ong, the founder and CEO of the Malaysia-based organization LEAP (Land Empowerment Animals People), had a bit more positive spin on the program.

“[It] has succeeded in rallying state governments on the island of Borneo to coalesce around the core area of Borneo,” she said, adding, “I prefer to see and build on the positives of something rather than to dwell on the negatives.”

Still, Ong thinks WWF may have taken the wrong approach on the project from the beginning. “I would have framed Heart of Borneo as a movement and one that is self-organizing, rather than a program to be managed,” she said, noting that given the sheer size of the plan “‘management’ will always be an impossible task.”

But things only got worse in the Heart of Borneo, and across the island, last year. Every dry season, local farmers and companies burn forests in Indonesia to clear vegetation because fire is cheap. Last year’s burning season was one of the worst on record: 2.1 million hectares (over 8,000 square miles), an area the size of New Jersey, went up in smoke.

“With the biggest environmental disaster of the twenty-first century unfolding as we speak, Heart of Borneo clearly hasn’t done enough,” said Meijaard.

When it comes to the Heart of Borneo, WWF seems to have lost its way somewhere, say its critics. Perhaps the plan was too grandiose to succeed. Perhaps the focus on influencing powerful and entrenched industries through behind-the-scenes influence proved a red herring. Or perhaps WWF was simply more committed to selling the idea to governments and donors than to actually implementing it. Whatever the case, the Heart of Borneo appears to be on life-support today.

While it’s difficult to find good analyses of many of the world’s big conservation programs, the Heart of Borneo does not appear to be an isolated case. A 2015 report by USAID on a project it funded of WWF-US called Conservation and Adaptation in Asia’s High Mountains Landscapes and Communities (AHM) uncovered deep levels of mismanagement. Like the Heart of Borneo, AHM is a massive, transnational program. It aims to help communities in snow leopard (Panthera uncial) territories by working with them on water issues, climate change, and resource use.

According to the report, the program “urgently needs a reboot.” It criticizes AHM for failing to bring in local WWF offices across the six countries involved, for wholly ignoring other snow leopard conservation programs, and for micromanaging from Washington, D.C.

USAID gave WWF-US a D for management and a D for communications and information sharing. It also warned that funding issues were beginning to erode the project’s efficacy and credibility.

But WWF isn’t the only group to struggle over some of its programs. One of the most egregious examples in recent memory is CI’s work to improve marine biodiversity through collaborating with local communities in Milne Bay, Papua New Guinea, in 2006. The UN Development Program found that CI had significantly mismanaged its $6 million budget, leading it to run through funds a year early (CI denied this). But the group’s relationship with locals proved just as messy: it ran afoul of the local governor over financial concerns and accusations of elitism and arrogance. At one point he ordered all CI employees out of the area and even locked them out of their offices.

Of course, this doesn’t mean every new conservation project fails at big groups like WWF, CI, or TNC. However, critics at least anecdotally implied repeatedly that new conservation faced greater trials and a generally lower success rate than programs that involved a more traditional focus and a clearer set of goals, such as protect this water body or boost this animal’s population. Critics also argued that small groups generally have a better track record because they are more knowledgeable about local communities and more aware of issues that could trip up success.

Detente?

“It’s not tension. It’s bewilderment,” said Paul Salaman, the CEO of Rainforest Trust, when I asked him about the tension between traditionalists and new conservationists. The Rainforest Trust largely practices traditional conservation by establishing protected areas both large and small in tropical countries.

“Seriously, I understand that we want to look at different strategies,” he said, but new conservation is “not really targeting the wildlife that needs help…it’s certainly not a huge help for international conservation. I think, unfortunately, at best, it’s proven to be a bit of a distraction.”

Still, others view the whole discussion about new conservation versus old as the real distraction.

“[The debate] has taken a lot of attention from much more important issues and part of that is because the issues that we face….are so great that we really can’t afford to be spending time worrying about is one organization taking the right approach,” said Turner of CI.

Andrew Terry, head of conservation programs at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, a traditional conservation organization focused on saving gravely endangered species, agreed that the debate itself had become problematic.

“It implies a schism within the conservation field. I personally think this is a slightly false distinction that distracts us from the real discussions in conservation.”

He compared the best conservationists to magpies, willing to apply any tool from across various fields — basically having a whatever-it-takes attitude.

“This is what keeps conservation exciting and relevant,” he noted. “But at the same time, we need to make sure that this does not come at the expense of tried and tested approaches, and that they retain their place in the ever-expanding toolbox.”

The vitriolic nature of the debate has died down a little in recent years, perhaps out of sheer exhaustion. New conservationists have been quick to say that they never meant to disparage the work that has gone before or that parks don’t matter. For their part, some traditionalists are employing “new” methods piecemeal in their work if they seem useful in a given situation. And they sometimes concede that the goals of both philosophies are broadly the same, even if the two camps want to take different routes to get there.

But while the new-versus-traditional debate may be cooling, criticism of the biggest of the big conservation NGOs for their perceived clumsiness, bureaucracy, and ineffectiveness is not.

Conservation work has never been easy and as environmental threats have multiplied and globalized, it’s only gotten messier. Conservationists often have to navigate local skepticism, government ambivalence, business animosity, and competition with other NGOs. They have to battle whole political philosophies that treat the environment not as something to be valued and protected, but simply a roadblock to endless economic growth And they have to convince an inherently short-sighted species — Homo sapiens — to think in the long-term, to think indeed of generations long after they are gone. It’s an uphill, rain-swept, mud-splattered battle everyday.

“You could easily get disheartened and think, ‘God, you know, I’d rather be an accountant,’” said Salaman. But he added that when he sees the species his group has helped, he feels it is “making a difference.”

Salaman concluded that “we’re all in this together and we’re all doing our best, so you know…”

Indeed, every day thousands of conservationists get up around the world and devote the majority of their waking hours to a cause that can prove debilitating, frustrating, trying, and certainly not financially rewarding. They are facing down mass extinction, ecological Armageddon for our children, with finite resources. So their intense focus on approach and efficacy is not only understandable, but vital. There’s not a single conservationist on the planet who thinks, “Yes, we’re doing enough.”

But we can still ask: is what we’re doing working? Are we changing hearts and minds? Are we fighting the good fight? Will species be alive tomorrow that wouldn’t be here if not for our efforts? Or have we somehow lost our way — did we go astray somewhere — and if so how do we get back on track? After all, life is at stake.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Leo Bottrill worked with park authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as an employee of WWF. In fact, he worked with park authorities in Vietnam as an employee of a different conservation NGO. A previous version of this story erroneously stated that Will Turner was with Conservation International’s ocean’s division. We regret the errors.

0,"A Goffin’s cockatoo, looking for some attention, pokes its beak out of a plastic enclosure and chirps. Down the hall, a pigeon with a fractured wing is operated on, a mourning dove has its physical exam, and a Uromastyx, a spiny-tailed lizard, is given an oral calcium supplement.

The Center for Avian and Exotic Medicine on the Upper West Side is the only hospital of its kind in New York City, and one of roughly 10 exotics-only veterinary practices in the United States.

Many New Yorkers mistake exotic animals for pets that are inexpensive and easy to care for, according to doctors at the center. The lack of appropriate care early on often leads to irreversible illnesses that plague the animals for the rest of their shortened lives.

“I cringe when I hear someone is bringing a kinkajou in,” said Lorelei Tibbetts, a nurse and practice manager at the center. “They belong in the canopy of the rainforest, not in a New York City apartment.”

On average, the center sees 70 patients per week, and about 80% of the illnesses the center treats are related to the inadequate care these unusual pets receive in captivity.

Iguanas, potbelly pigs, alligators, and a domesticated fox are among the illegal animals residing in New York that the hospital has admitted over its 12 years in business.

The practice isn’t lucrative—avian and exotic pet owners don’t habitually bring their animals in for dental work, flea and tick prevention and vaccines, which is how most veterinary hospitals that treat dogs and cats turn a profit.

And when these animals do need medical care, pet owners can be reluctant to shell out cash. Some exotic pet owners avoid treatment altogether, for fear that they’ll be penalized for breaking the law.

“It’s not the family golden retriever,” said Tibbetts. “They’re not prepared to spend thousands of dollars on a parakeet or a rabbit for the most part.”

Nick Bianchino lives in Brooklyn and shares his home with a green iguana that he purchased at an exotic pet exposition in Pennsylvania. He said he takes better care of his pet Iggy’s health than he does his own.

When Iggy cut her dulap—the little flap of skin that hangs under iguanas’ chins—while burrowing before she laid eggs, Bianchino brought her to the center.

“I was very impressed because they had treated it before and knew exactly what was wrong with her,” he said. Iggy took oral antibiotics for two weeks before returning to her usual healthy state.

Bianchino says owning an iguana is rewarding, but that he’s glad they’re outlawed in the city. “They’re very difficult to care for, and the lighting you have to buy for them to live in optimal conditions is expensive.""

Iggy lives in a six-foot tall, four-foot wide and three-foot deep enclosure that’s humid and equipped with special UVA and UVB lighting. At four feet long, she’s starting to outgrow it, he said. He plans to expand the length a few feet to accommodate her increase in size. Eventually, when he buys a house, he'll eliminate the enclosure altogether and dedicate a whole room to her.

“Most reptiles require really specific care,” said Dr. Anthony Pilny, one of the center’s veterinarians. “Either it’s hard for people to do or the novelty wears off and they don’t want to do it.”

Marie Theresa, another client, lives with five ferrets—Simba, Precious, Nemo, Lady Marley, and Joey. Theresa says she recognizes the value of regular trips to the vet for her brood, noting that “their diet, physiology, medical care, illnesses and treatments cannot be compared to those of dogs and cats.”

Theresa’s ferrets have even caught the flu from her, and vice versa.

“Anything that could go wrong with us could go wrong with them: not eating, loss of appetite, behavior changes, injuries, diarrhea, or a fight with another animal,” says Dr. Pilny, who shares his home with 15 birds, a cat, and a snake.

On a recent weekday, Dr. Pilny performed a surgery on a pigeon, pinning its ulna and splinting its wing. The entire surgery took half an hour.

Later that afternoon, he treated a bearded dragon reptile for constipation.

The center also recently boarded a self-mutilating African gray parrot, Miko, who had been pulling out its own feathers, and ripping holes in its skin.

“You see that with the birds a lot. They have vivid personalities and if the captivation and social interaction is not handled properly, it can have ramifications on the bird that aren’t positive,” said Joe Hendler, a veterinary assistant.

Industry studies show a decline in exotic pet ownership in New York City. Tibbetts said that this is a good thing, even though what’s best for the animals could be bad for business.

“Overall it’s something we do because we love the animals,” said Tibbetts. She said that it’s difficult to properly care for some exotics, like the rare kinkajou, or fennec fox, in captivity. “To care for them properly in captivity so that they don’t get sick and so that they have a decent quality of life is almost impossible.”

0,"For the second time in one month, Colombians are infuriated over mining plans in one of their country’s most treasured natural sites.

Several concessions are currently being considered for open-pit gold mining projects in one of the most beautiful environmental reserves in all of Colombia, the Valley of Cocora in the department of Quindio.

The proposals would span over 12,000 hectares near the town of Salento in this famed coffee region, a famous destination for tourists who come to marvel at the wax palm trees, one of Colombia’s most important national emblems.

The valley supports a delicate yet richly diverse ecosystem, as the palms provide an important sanctuary for rare species like the endangered yellow-eared parrot and the Andean condor.

The proposed plans have made Colombians particularly incredulous since merely last month, another of their world famous environmental landmarks was also on the auction block for its fracking potential.

Though eventually denied, the government was considering a bid from US oil company Hupecol to drill 150 exploratory holes near the iconic Caño Cristales River in the Macarena region.

Tired of their government parceling out their natural heritage to multinational corporations, locals have been furiously protesting the Corcora proposals with the hashtags #NoalaMegamineraenSalento (No to mega-mining in Salento) and #YoDefiendoLaPalmaDeCera (I defend the wax palm).

According to Salento’s Ombudsman, Tatiana Herrera, there’s a social movement ready to “tie themselves to the wax palms so they won’t be destroyed,” she told newspaper El Tiempo.

The community feels impotent because it doesn’t know what to do. This is why from the Ombudsman’s Office we are undertaking a crusade to strengthen ourselves and be able to reach the ultimate legal bodies in order to stop these projects.

Salento’s Ombudsman, Tatiana Herrera

Herrera has already created an online petition called “Stop megamining in Salento” that currently has more than 12,000 signatures.

Almost insultingly, the National Mining Agency (ANM) has given the municipality 30 days to prepare the environmental, social, and technical studies necessary to determine whether the projects should proceed, according to El Tiempo.

Several concessions are currently being considered for open-pit gold mining projects in one of the most beautiful environmental reserves in all of Colombia, the Valley of Cocora in the department of Quindio.

The proposals would span over 12,000 hectares near the town of Salento in this famed coffee region, a famous destination for tourists who come to marvel at the wax palm trees, one of Colombia’s most important national emblems.

The valley supports a delicate yet richly diverse ecosystem, as the palms provide an important sanctuary for rare species like the endangered yellow-eared parrot and the Andean condor.

The proposed plans have made Colombians particularly incredulous since merely last month, another of their world famous environmental landmarks was also on the auction block for its fracking potential.

Though eventually denied, the government was considering a bid from US oil company Hupecol to drill 150 exploratory holes near the iconic Caño Cristales River in the Macarena region.

Tired of their government parceling out their natural heritage to multinational corporations, locals have been furiously protesting the Corcora proposals with the hashtags #NoalaMegamineraenSalento (No to mega-mining in Salento) and #YoDefiendoLaPalmaDeCera (I defend the wax palm).

According to Salento’s Ombudsman, Tatiana Herrera, there’s a social movement ready to “tie themselves to the wax palms so they won’t be destroyed,” she told newspaper El Tiempo.

The community feels impotent because it doesn’t know what to do. This is why from the Ombudsman’s Office we are undertaking a crusade to strengthen ourselves and be able to reach the ultimate legal bodies in order to stop these projects.

Herrera has already created an online petition called “Stop megamining in Salento” that currently has more than 12,000 signatures.

Almost insultingly, the National Mining Agency (ANM) has given the municipality 30 days to prepare the environmental, social, and technical studies necessary to determine whether the projects should proceed, according to El Tiempo.

0,"Since its beginnings, conservation has had a people problem. An ugly history of marginalizing indigenous and local communities living in ecosystems designated for protection has made re-gaining trust and building relationships with these groups one of the toughest aspects of conservation today.

In Part 4 of Conservation, Divided, veteran Mongabay reporter Jeremy Hance explores how the field has shifted to embrace local communities as partners in conservation — and the work that remains to be done.

Conservation, Divided is an in-depth four-part series investigating how the field of conservation has changed over the last 30 years — and the challenges it faces moving into an uncertain future. Hance completed the series over the course of eight months. Stories are running weekly between April 26 and May 17.

My five-year-old daughter loves pretending to be Yanomama. She goes outside, collects branches and leaves, and makes “food.” She turns over rocks looking for insects and watches the birds. She talks about things like poison arrow frogs and three-toed sloths. The Yanomama, or Yanomami, is a highly imperiled indigenous tribe living in the Amazon rainforest. You’d think my daughter might have learned about them from her environmental-journalist father, but in fact it was from her preschool class, which spent three weeks studying the rainforest.

My daughter loves pretending at Yanomama, but she doesn’t yet know how bad things are for the world’s indigenous tribes. Throughout history, indigenous peoples have been brutalized, belittled, and decimated by powerful interlopers. Whole groups have gone extinct, their traditions, language, and culture vanishing forever like a puff of smoke.

And the process continues. One of the most glaring — and least reported on — human rights crises today is the treatment of indigenous peoples at the hands of power-hungry governments, amoral corporations, and waves of settlers.

But conservation too has played a role. Governments have used the preservation of land and wildlife as justification to remove indigenous peoples from their homes, sometimes with the support (or simply silence) of conservation groups.

Since its beginnings, conservation has had a people problem. Indeed, the biggest internal crisis the field has faced over the last century is its treatment of local people, and most acutely indigenous people. An ugly past has made re-gaining trust and building relationships with people living near areas targeted for protection one of the toughest aspects of conservation today.

But, after a long, hard look in the mirror, the field has changed. Many conservationists and groups now embrace the establishment of indigenous reserves as one of the most innovative — and frankly effective — ways of protecting species from extinction. Many conservationists also work directly with indigenous groups, asking and listening instead of telling and demanding. But still there is much work to do.

Ugly past — and present

In the 1990s, the Botswana government began kicking San and Bakgalagadi people out of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Ironically, the park was created, in 1961, in part to allow the indigenous bushmen to live and hunt unmolested inside its borders, making their living as they had for millennia. It was also created to safeguard its rich wildlife. But things changed after a number of ecologists and officials raised concerns that wildlife populations were declining in the reserve. This gave the government an excuse to establish control over the bushmen and, allegedly, secure the diamonds underneath their land.

The government’s response proved, unsurprisingly, to be a human rights disaster. It forced the bushmen to resettle outside the reserve, where they must depend on government handouts for survival. Security forces have routinely beaten them for attempting to return to hunt or forage in their homeland (though wealthy trophy hunters can pay to shoot animals inside the park: they are exempt from the national hunting ban that applies to locals). Today, the San and Bakgalagadi are still waging a legal war to return to the land their ancestors called home.

Botswana’s bushmen are hardly alone in being subject to abuse or displacement in the name of conservation, typically to make way for a new protected area or to shield wildlife from traditional hunting. Indeed, when one of the first modern protected areas — Yosemite National Park in California — was established, the people who lived there, the Miwok tribe, were killed or forced out over a period of decades.

It’s almost impossible to know the full extent of conservation’s impact on locals, but one paper estimated that as many as 14 million people in Africa alone have become “conservation refugees” since the beginning of modern conservation, including the Maasai of eastern Africa, who were pushed off their traditional grazing lands to make way for many of the parks that foreign tourists enjoy today. India’s government also admits to over a million, most of them moved to protect tigers. But few other hard numbers exist.

“The problem for indigenous peoples is this kind of conservation is ‘conservation without humans’ or ‘conservation that avoids people,’” said Mina Susana Setra, an activist from the Dayak tribe in Indonesian Borneo who works for the rights NGO the Indigenous Peoples’ Alliance of the Archipelagos. “[It] promotes only nature, flora and fauna, but not humans.”

She pointed to the ongoing “Nature is Speaking” campaign by the NGO Conservation International (CI) as a good example of this kind of thinking, with its message at the end of every video that “Nature doesn’t need people. People need nature.”

Setra told me, via email, that the Indonesian government has “copied” this style of conservation and “disregard[ed] our own community based ‘conservation’ system.”

She said this has led to numerous indigenous groups being moved out of their territories to make way for national parks in the country, such as the Dongi-Dongi people for the creation Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, the Banding Agung for Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Sumatra, and the Kasepuhan Karang for Mount Halimun Salak National Park in Java.

“The Kasepuhan Karang now struggle to carry out economic and cultural practices that have sustained them for generations,” said Setra, who pointed out that the indigenous group had lived on land for over 600 years that is now a part of the park.

In part, this ugly history between conservation and indigenous peoples grew out of the fact that many early conservation schemes were started by European colonial governments, which not only exploited their colonies’ material wealth, but also valued their wild riches. Racism, of course, also played a major role. Invaders and governments depicted indigenous peoples (and some still do today) as backward, other, and requiring re-education and conversion to western religion and lifestyles in a bid to save their heathen souls — and steal their land.

At the same time, governments worldwide have used conservation as an excuse to remove, debilitate, or simply exterminate indigenous groups, including as a tactic in the U.S. government’s war against Native Americans that lasted into the twentieth century. But conservationists themselves are hardly blameless, having long advocated for parks overlapping indigenous areas and — at least in the past — viewing indigenous peoples as grave threats to nature rather than as protectors.

Conservationists began by propagating the idea that true wilderness must be emptied of people, according to Jonathan Mazower, Advocacy Director for Survival International, a London-based activist organization devoted to indigenous groups.

“A prevalent view among conservationists has been that all human presence poses a direct threat to the natural environment, and that certain areas need to be returned to ‘wilderness’ by evicting people from their land,” he told me through a spokesperson.

He called this view of wilderness “a colonial idea based on [a] false assumption,” since such lands had “been managed by indigenous peoples for millennia.”

Most of the world’s so-called wildernesses have been inhabited for tens of thousands of years, at least. Really the only wildernesses on the planet left unshaped by people by the time the Polynesians conquered the Pacific around 1000 AD were Antarctica and the deep sea. Today with climate change, ocean acidification, and trawling nothing remains unaffected.

Still, Don Weeden, director of the Bedford Hills, New York-based Weeden Foundation, which supports wildlife-conservation projects, asserted that the belief that indigenous groups have been gravely harmed by conservation in the past arises from looking at the unfortunate exceptions, not the general rule.

“You take any sort of set of policies and actions and you’re always going to find those that had unintended consequences or perhaps are a little misguided, but those are fairly rare and [do] not typify traditional conservation,” he told me.

While experts debate the extent of the impact and damage, very few dispute that bad things have been done to indigenous and local people in the name of conservation.

Conservation groups wake up

After over a century of similarly repeated abuses, the conservation world had an awakening — of sorts. In part, this was promoted by a growing awareness among conservationists and a sometimes-painful recognition of past sins. But there were also failed projects to reckon with and mounting research showing that indigenous peoples were often as good or better protectors of their lands than establishing formal protected areas.

The longtime approach of evicting people from their homelands in order to make way for wildlife — often described as “guns and fences” or “fortress conservation” — came under fire. The first real sign of evolution came in 1975. That’s when the World Parks Congress, a decadal conference organized by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), adopted a resolution that recognized the rights of indigenous and traditional people.

Growing political empowerment of indigenous tribes around the world furthered the process, according to Fred Nelson, executive director of the Burlington, Vermont-based Maliasili Initiatives, an NGO that works with conservation groups in Africa to link human needs and environmental benefits.

Nelson pointed to greater recognition and some territorial rights granted to indigenous peoples across South America, Australia, and Canada, beginning in the 1990s. Not only were conservationists realizing they were in the wrong to marginalize indigenous groups, but in many parts of the world indigenous groups were rising up and demanding a say.

“[They] forced conservation to change and work more collaboratively with indigenous people that are securing clear rights over their territory, as well as much more influence in development and policy processes,” said Nelson.

On the academic side, Nelson touted the work of the late Nobel Prize-winning political economist Elinor Ostrom, who studied how some communities have been able to sustainably manage ecosystems over long periods of time.

Today, most big conservation groups have developed policies for working with indigenous groups and many conservationists have begun to see them as partners, and sometimes even as mentors. Out of this have come not only dynamic partnerships between conservationists and local people, but also new and arguably better methods of protecting wildlife and wild lands that are becoming de rigeur in the field. These include so-called “community conservation” projects and expanding land rights for indigenous people.

Traditional, new, and community conservation

Attitudes towards indigenous and local people began changing just before the rise, in the last three decades, of a new philosophy in conservation. “New conservation,” as it has been called, focuses on how nature benefits people and their economic concerns. Its methods include developing certification schemes to promote more sustainably produced commodities, payment for ecosystem services schemes that aim to get the market or government to pay to maintain ecosystems for the services they provide humanity, and partnering with the world’s biggest industries in order to stem the damage they do.

The new philosophy rose to the fore in a number of large conservation NGOs, such as CI, the Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). And it jibed nicely with the new way of thinking about indigenous and local people as partners in conservation.

“We understand that you cannot conserve wildlife at the expense of people, that ultimately the social and environmental dimensions at the landscape level go hand-in-hand,” Deon Nel, WWF-International’s Global Conservation Director, told me.

Still, according to Nelson, new conservation isn’t responsible for conservationists’ shift in thinking about local and indigenous people. Rather, it is a partial product of that awakening.

“[The shift] has happened in 1,000 different ways in 1,000 different places around the world, and has gradually accumulated into systemic changes within conservation thought and practice,” said Nelson.

He added that new conservation programs today are “partly a function of the gradual recognition that conservation must, to be successful, speak to the needs and interests of rural communities around the world — who are ultimately the majority of conservationists on the ground.”

Nelson argued that more traditional views of conservation — such as the mandate to preserve nature as a moral and cultural good — are a “post-colonial way of thinking and acting” and simply do not work in places like eastern and southern Africa where his organization operates.

“[It is] an operational dead-end to think that poor farmers in Mozambique or Rwanda should sacrifice their well-being and life options because conservationists in the US or Europe value the existence of wild animals in Africa,” he said. “For most people in rural Africa who actually encounter them, elephants and lions are terrifying. And unless those people receive countervailing value or benefit, it is ludicrous to expect people to want to have them around. So making wildlife valuable to those people is, to me, the frontlines of conservation in Africa.”

While the rise of new conservation has also led to impassioned debate over its efficacy and approach, the people problem is one of the few areas where new conservationists and traditionalists are generally in agreement.

For example, although traditional conservationists largely focus not on people but rather on protecting wild lands and wildlife, some work closely with locals, seeing them as the best resource in protecting endangered species and places.

Noga Shanee, co-founder of the NGO Neotropical Primate Conservation (NPC), told me that while her group is strictly traditional in its aim to protect species in northern Peru, it depends on local people to instigate its activities. “The communities we work with are doing most of the conservation work themselves. They chose the areas they want to conserve and are doing so to the best of their abilities,” she said.

NPC works with farmers to develop their own community-conservation parks, something she said the locals are eager to do. Community conservation means that locals, rather than NGOs or governments, are the top decision-makers and set up their own rules governing their protected area. However, in order to work they also must convince the government to recognize their parks.

“Many of the projects we are working with had actively looked for an organization that would help them realize their dreams. We didn’t need to convince them and definitely not fight them,” Shanee explained.

The upsides of working in this way are undeniable, according to Shanee. “These reserves are much more respected by the local communities…and some suffer from lower deforestation rates than the state-run ones.”

But Shanee cautioned that the Peruvian government makes it needlessly difficult for community conservationists to succeed, likely because it doesn’t like to forfeit control of the land. “Local people just can’t deal with the paperwork and payments themselves,” she said of Peru’s onerous bureaucracy around community conservation. “I am sure that it is completely intentional.”

This lack of support can lead to violence. Shanee noted that local people working with her group have been socially outcast, and even been subjected to kidnappings and death threats. Local environmentalists and indigenous leaders often risk it all when they stand up to governments or industry for the environment. According to the international environmental and human rights NGO Global Witness, at least 1,024 environmental and land activists were assassinated or murdered between 2002 and 2014.

Community conservation is, of course, also happening at organizations that have tilted towards new conservation in recent years. CI started out focused wholly on biodiversity, but the group did a major shift over the last decade or so to focus its mission around people, specifically how nature helps people.

At Bird’s Head Seascape off the coast of West Papua in Indonesia, CI helped set up locally managed conservation areas. The group says the project effectively cut illegal fishing by 90 percent and increased dive tourism, bringing in revenue for locals. (CI was also the first large conservation NGO to put an indigenous person on its board of directors, Megaron with the Kayapo tribe of Brazil.)

Still, research on the effectiveness of community conservation is somewhat mixed. While there are many positive and effective programs out there, community conservation also faces challenges, such as skeptical governments, lower than expected economic benefits, local governance problems, and often a single-species focus that leaves other wildlife out. In short, many of the same issues that can trip up conservation in general also threaten the success of community conservation.

Indigenous land rights: conservation’s Holy Grail?

Conservationists have recently begun realizing that indigenous territories and indigenous land rights are potentially game-changing conservation tools. Indigenous territories, called indigenous protected areas in Australia, are places where the government legally recognizes an indigenous group’s right to the land, allowing the group to manage it collectively.

According to a report called Common Ground released in March by an Oxfam-led trio of NGOs, around 50 percent of land on Earth is claimed by “customary land users” — indigenous or local people who have been living on and using the land for a certain amount of time. However, the report notes that ownership of just 10 percent has been legally recognized. The majority of this is in just five countries: the main one, Brazil, where indigenous territories cover about 110 million hectares or 13 percent of the land, as well as Australia, Canada, Mexico, and China. (Reservations for indigenous groups in the US are not included in this list as they may or may not be part of traditional territory, represent a vast reduction of what was historically occupied, and were often forced on native Americans after decades of war and broken pledges.)

In most of the world indigenous and local people do not have any legal rights to their land. In Africa, for instance, the World Bank estimates that 90 percent of community-run rural land is currently unrecognized by governments, leading to a plague of land grabbing on the continent.

Conservationists are belatedly recognizing what has long been obvious to indigenous activists: that instead of threatening nature, tribal ways of life cause far less harm to the environment than Western lifestyles and that tribes are incredibly effective protectors of their land.

“Forest for Indigenous Peoples is the resource for everything; connection to the spirits of their ancestors that continuously guide the way through millennia; food and water for their generation and the next to come; shelter for their peoples; medicines for those who are sick; cultural defense in the dynamic and changing world; a dignity and identity in the crisis of value, that makes them proud to be indigenous,” Setra said. “It is their home and they would die fighting to keep it safe.”

Indeed, a growing body of research shows that indigenous territories are often as good as strict protected areas at stemming deforestation and in some cases they are even better. And there’s so much potentially claimable high-biodiversity land that vast tracts could be protected and managed by indigenous stewards, rather than by governments; but they would still be respected by governments, which could make all the difference.

“Certainly, I think that all of us in the conservation field have recognized that indigenous peoples have an important role to play in conservation and that indigenous reserves make a lot of sense,” said Weeden.

Given this, many conservationists are now promoting the concept of indigenous land rights, contributing expertise to land-rights movements, and helping set territorial boundaries through mapping. In some cases they are helping manage indigenous territories once they are set up, usually taking a back seat to indigenous leaders.

“Those of us who have been in the conservation movement for a long time have always engaged in such activities because experienced conservationists who work in the field in the remote corners of our planet know that you can’t succeed without partnering with people,” said Russell Mittermeier, CI’s Executive Vice-Chair and past president, and a renowned tropical forest conservation scientist.

Legal title allows indigenous peoples much greater latitude to keep industries — such as logging, mining, and fossil fuels — out of their land. It gives them the ability to turn to the government if squatters or land grabbers infiltrate their land. It also allows them, if they wish, to establish strict protected areas on their land.

“It is basically impossible for local communities to practice conservation if they do not have legal rights over their land and territories; they cannot control their environment without such rights,” explained Nelson by email. “The conservation community needs to become MUCH more pro-active around community land rights reform than it has been.”

Of course, legal land title for local groups also comes with risks for conservation. One is that indigenous or local owners could decide to allow industry into their land at some later date. For example, in Papua New Guinea, ruthless companies have used bribery, intimidation, and even force to get at forests that supposedly belong to the communities living there.

Another risk is that as populations rise and needs change over time, indigenous groups could begin to impact their environments more severely. Indeed, research has shown that the extinction of megafauna across all continents except Africa around 10,000 years ago (think woolly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and woolly rhinos) was not due to climate change but to small groups of hunter-gatherers wiping out most of the large, slow-breeding animals. It may be that if the global population continues to grow at its current staggering rate, and if forests continue to be overhunted and oceans overfished, there will be no easy choices left. These are the sorts of fears that keep conservationists awake at night.

But proponents of indigenous territories as a conservation tool — and not just as a human rights issue — say that indigenous peoples are much less likely to invite industry into their forests than governments are, and that given their centuries of knowledge and tradition they will remain far better protectors of the forest than wildlife rangers and fences.

One way to confront conservation concerns is for indigenous territories to specifically stipulate broader protections for nature. Mittermeier pointed to Suriname, where indigenous communities declared a massive conservation corridor spanning 7.2 million hectares (28,000 square miles) last year with support from both CI and WWF-Guianas. “This is an area about the size of Ireland and is inhabited by only about 3,000 people living in eight communities,” said Mittermeier.

This indigenous area not only protects the tribes living there, but also specifically protects natural resources like rivers in its agreement.

For Dayak activist Setra, the one thing the Indonesian government must do “before all other things” is to grant indigenous people the legal rights to their land.

“Our call is: support community mapping and recognize Indigenous territories and collective lands and provide strong, secure legal protections for the people who protect forest, nature and environment,” she said.

Still, this battle for land-title recognition has also bumped up against one of the biggest conservation initiatives developed over the last few decades. The UN’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) program would pay developing countries — and potentially local communities — to keep forests standing in order to mitigate climate change. But many indigenous groups view REDD+ as just another way for governments and big conservation NGOs to grab power over their forests — as a rerun of national parks co-opting their land. A number of indigenous groups have battled hard to keep REDD+ out of their forests, while others contend that the long, bureaucratic process has left them out in the cold when they were hoping to benefit economically from the program.

REDD+ falls decidedly under the new conservation banner. And although new conservation touts itself as being all about people, it appears to dwell in a paradox. On the one hand, new conservation at its core views people, and especially economic benefits for them, as essential to moving conservation forward. But at the same time, payment for ecosystem services programs like REDD+ have not only proven difficult to implement but have begun to alienate some of the indigenous groups on whose environments certain programs would rely.

New conservation has further been seen as undercutting its people-first message via its emphasis on partnerships with powerful industries and massive corporations, including some of the world’s largest mining and fossil fuel companies with ugly records when it comes to indigenous communities and locals. For example, one of CI’s partners, Chevron, is currently embroiled in a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit with several indigenous communities in Ecuador over oil spills and pollution that the company inherited when it merged with Texaco. The case has taken numerous twists and turns, but indigenous communities contend that Chevron has falsified evidence and paid off officials to avoid paying court-ordered reparations. Still, CI remains partners with the oil giant.

Traditional protected areas and saving wildlife

Of course, given traditional conservationists’ longtime focus on wildlife and wild places over people, it’s even easier to criticize them for overlooking human needs — and doing so for over a century.

But Weeden, who has a degree in public health and worked in the aid sector in developing countries, told me the story is more complex. He said allegations that old-school conservationists are “elitists” or “don’t care about human suffering or poverty” are “false.”

“It’s not being anti-human at all, it’s just caring passionately about the 10 to 15 million other species,” he said.

And, in an age where extractive industries are moving farther afield to gain access to dwindling natural resources, conservationists and indigenous people now sometimes find themselves both supporting strict protected areas. Paul Salaman, the CEO of the Virginia-based traditional conservation group the Rainforest Trust, told me he sees more and more indigenous groups embracing, not fighting, traditional protected areas as a way to keep corporations and settlers out, especially if they are involved in the process.

“There are a number of indigenous communities that welcome strict protected areas adjacent to their land, and as much as anything to avoid companies, oil palm growers, timber companies, gold miners…coming in and destroying that area,” he said.

He pointed to the Rainforest Trust’s work with the Matsés indigenous peoples in Peru. After the group helped the Matsés establish an indigenous reserve, the Matsés supported setting aside adjacent land as a strict nature reserve, according to Salaman. In 2009, the Rainforest Trust and its local partner, CEDIA, helped found the Matsés National Reserve, covering over 1 million acres.

“And we were just in time,” said Salaman, adding that there might otherwise have been a gold rush in the area.

Indeed, strict protected areas are not always a bad outcome for people living nearby. Research has shown that communities close to protected areas are actually better off than similar communities far away, providing further evidence that traditional conservation can benefit people — so long as they are included in the discussions and their rights respected.

“There are no forest rights without forest,” Phil Dickie, a spokesperson for WWF-International told me. “So protection matters.”

Even wildlife-focused conservation efforts can benefit locals, too. Andrew Terry with Jersey-Island-based Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust said that his organization, which focuses wholly on saving incredibly endangered species from extinction, has found that its efforts often help people living nearby.

For example, Durrell’s Madagascar pochard project has delivered a number of benefits to local Malagasy people. Durrell is working to restore La Sofia wetlands and lake as a place of future release for the Critically Endangered Madagascar pochard (Aythya innotata) — a duck that has a global population of around 100, three-quarters of it in captivity. The wetlands around the lake suffer from widespread deforestation on the banks, siltation, poor water quality, low biodiversity, and exotic fish, said Terry, who pointed out that even so, this freshwater ecosystem is among the most ecologically healthy in central Madagascar.

Durrell is now working with locals to enhance water quality and better manage the wetlands by improving livestock management, diversifying crops, and supporting primary education, among other tactics. Many of these activities are new-conservation-style programs, and Terry said his group, although largely traditional in its outlook, will employ any tool it determines will help get the job of saving species done. In addition to the immediate benefits of improved agriculture and education, the project will ultimately benefit the local populace by providing cleaner water and improved local freshwater fisheries.

“Species are intrinsically connected to their broader environments — one cannot save a species without considering the pressures acting on their ecosystem and the other elements that make up that ecosystem,” said Terry. “We believe, and can demonstrate, that a focus on species can actually bring people together and bring a focus to address whole ecosystem problems.”

In other words, even wildlife-focused conservation can benefit local communities, simply by improving the health of the environment and working with locals as partners. Durrell didn’t get involved in the area because of the poverty of locals, but because of a nearly extinct duck. In the end, though, both may well see a better future.

Can emphasis on people go too far?

As the notion of including local and indigenous communities in conservation decisions has gained traction, it has also received some pushback. John Payne, head of the Borneo Rhino Alliance, said that sometimes efforts to work with and appease every local or so-called stakeholder group have “gone beyond a joke.”

“Years can go by while all that talking is going on, and attrition of forests and animal populations occurs, potentially to the point of total loss. In the long run, little of biological value will be saved by the consultation process, and we will still have lots of poor and disadvantaged people,” Payne told me.

He pointed to the establishment of two parks in Malaysian Borneo as examples, Tabin National Park in 1984 and Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in 1997. “Neither of those protected areas would have been established if there was a stakeholder consultation process along the lines that we imagine has to be done nowadays,” he said.

Tabin National Park would have likely been derailed by a local village and logging interests, according to Payne. As for Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, he said locals almost universally opposed the park and it only went through due to the will of a handful of government officials.

Today, however, the local view of Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary has done a complete 180, according to Payne. Locals now see the park as one of their only economic alternatives in a region drowning in monoculture plantations — and one of the last reminders of a bygone world.

“There is regret that the bulk of the region is oil-palm plantations, whose owners live far from the region, and whose labor force is foreign,” he said, adding that, today, eco-tourism in the park provides at least some locals with a different career path.

In Payne’s view, the lesson is that people in the area simply couldn’t imagine that most of the forest they had lived off for generations could be transformed into oil palm, so the value of establishing a reserve was unclear. That’s typical, he said. Establishing new protected areas sometimes requires the “leadership and persistence of a few people, against the views of the majority.”

Shanee with NPC also cautioned that conservationists must be wary of local expectations. She said her group does not work with communities if their primary goal is economic improvement — locals fixated on the idea that REDD+ will bring in money, for instance.

“Some people really believe that if they will conserve land, money will instantly come pouring in,” she said. “This is the result of the very confusing and problematic discourses of these kinds of schemes.”

But this is often how such schemes are sold to local and indigenous people: conservation will make you wealthier, conservation will bring you economic improvement, conservation will help your family. While conservationists may desperately want that to be true, the reality is much more complex. Potential economic benefits often take years of hard work to materialize — if they ever do — as in the case of ecotourism ventures, handicraft and other small-scale commercial enterprises, or payment for ecosystem services programs.

Once people realize they won’t become rich, they “get back to their normal activities, which are usually quite destructive,” Shanee added.

Instead, NPC works with communities who want to protect nature for other reasons — their spirituality, a commitment to sustainability, or the chance to gain greater recognition by the government and the broader Peruvian society among them. Certainly, economic betterment may come as a result, but it must not be the focus, said Shanee, or conservationists risk alienating local people.

Controversy persists

For all the progress, the relationship between conservationists and local people remains complicated. Memories of past abuse persist and locals continue to lodge accusations of elitism, disrespect, and stealing traditional land for protected areas.

Even when conservationists want to work in partnership with locals, they sometimes face bad decisions by governments that treat indigenous peoples as second-class citizens or want to grab power over minority groups.

Any notion that the conflict between conservation and indigenous and local people has ended is naïve, according to Mazower with Survival International.

“Many of the big conservation organizations — WWF, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Conservation International, African Wildlife Foundation, and the Nature Conservancy — are guilty of abusing tribal peoples’ rights,” he said. “They never speak out against evictions, they fund projects that violate tribal rights, and they treat complaints like ours as public relations ‘issues’ rather than acting swiftly.”

The group recently lodged a formal complaint with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development against WWF for its alleged links to abuse of Baka indigenous people in Cameroon. The complaint charges that WWF helped set up a series of protected areas without proper consent from the Baka, and that protected-area rangers, largely funded by WWF, have destroyed Baka homes and threatened them with violence.

However, Dickie, the WWF-International spokesperson, rejected these claims. He said that not only did WWF outperform formal requirements for establishing a protected area in the region, but also spent five years working with local communities to refine the park proposal based on their input, paying particular attention to involving politically and socially marginalized community members.

He added that WWF has been funding human-rights training for all ecoguards since 2006. “Investigation of incidents is difficult, particularly in the absence of detail, but where WWF has been able to verify any incidents of abuse involving ecoguards, it has taken the issue up with the ministry and other stakeholders. Some of those interventions do seem to have had some impact,” Dickie said.

The situation here is volatile and complex. Working in parts of the world like Cameroon — where poverty, conflict, and lack of governance prevail — forces conservationists to walk a tightrope between the desires to preserve species, protect forests, and mitigate human suffering.

The region is home to both the Baka (who lived in the forests for generations) and Bantu-speaking farmers who hold most of the local political power. Add to that a recent influx of war refugees from the Central African Republic and navigating tribal tensions becomes a constant difficulty. At the same time, poaching has become increasingly militarized, Dickie said, and some Baka have become involved, especially in killing elephants. But like so many poor, marginalized groups, the Baka are only being used as foot soldiers in the war over wildlife, acting on orders from more powerful actors, he said.

Dickie insisted WWF is doing what it can to improve life for both the Baka and the Bantu while also safeguarding wildlife, including working with Baka community organizations, helping to set up community policing initiatives, and increasing the number of Baka rangers. (Until recently the Cameroonian government permitted only Bantu to become rangers.)

“Unfortunately, we have trouble matching what [elephant] poachers are prepared to pay,” said Dickie.

WWF has policies governing how it engages with indigenous groups that recognize them as “key stewards” of their land and make “special efforts” to secure their rights. And Dickie added that “WWF has for some considerable time been trying to see if Survival is prepared to collaborate on initiatives which could benefit the Baka” — so far to no avail.

But Mazower contended that while WWF’s and other conservation groups’ policies “sound excellent on paper” they are “often ignored in practice.” He charged that big conservation groups continuously choose industry, corporations, and tourism over indigenous people.

And he is not alone in his critique of today’s conservation. For all the work going on with locals and indigenous groups, many conservationists still have a mindset that hasn’t moved much beyond the nineteenth century, according to Shanee.

“I think conservation had changed a lot in its discourses, but very little in essence,” she said, pointing out that many early parks were established to secure game animals for wealthy big-game-hunting colonists. She said this privileged mentality still exists in many conservation circles today.

“Local farmers trying to save their crops or feed their families are called poachers, whilst rich white people killing for amusement is perceived as a noble conservation effort,” Shanee said, referring to the support of groups like WWF and IUCN for trophy hunting under certain conditions. “It is a racist, socially unjust concept which alienates local people from conservation.”

Even the rush to develop eco-tourism projects, which are often billed as income-generators for locals, can suffer from the same attitude, according to Shanee: a focus on wealthy, privileged westerners over the people who actually live in the area.

“They launder the idea a bit better these days with names such as ‘Integrated Conservation and Development Program,’” she said, but “the idea is basically the same, conservation is largely used as a justification for territorialism.”

But Nelson said that in Africa, at least, eco-tourism is really the only thing keeping wildlife alive. “Where westerners may see Serengeti National Park through the lens of a precious global heritage set aside in perpetuity, the reason that the Serengeti is generally well managed and receives so much investment, is that it is an extraordinarily valuable commodity through tourism,” he explained.

Same thing with the mountain gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda. “They have not only survived but increased through years of political crisis and war in that region, because they are such a valuable commodity to those countries — a single gorilla trekking permit now is sold by the government for $750! — and this is what generates the highest level of often-elusive ‘political will’ to protect them,” Nelson said. “Those few hundred gorillas literally underpin Rwanda’s entire tourism industry.”

Conservation will only succeed in Africa if it “speaks to the social, economic, and political aspirations of African people and societies — [if] it takes those away then conservation will lose,” according to Nelson.

Nature needs people?

Given the ongoing messiness of conservation today, it might be time to consult experts from different fields, according to Terry with Durrell

“It is a real mistake to look at approaches developed by humanitarian aid specialists or sociologists and think that we as biologists know how to apply them effectively. We need to see stronger collaborations with other sectors,” he said.

As conservationists have demanded more and more of themselves — and had more and more demands placed on them by governments and the public — they have often failed to acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, they can’t do it all. Certainly, not well. I mean, just preventing mass extinction is a pretty tall order. So perhaps it is time to start working with experts far and wide. Not just economists and business leaders, but psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, trauma specialists in conflict areas, and of course indigenous and local community leaders.

Conservation’s people problem is not solved, not fully. And, given the very nature of conservation, there may always be tensions. According to Setra, we all may need to rethink how we view nature and how we think of our own species.

Indigenous peoples “have been and still are in many cases, the true conservationist, long before [conservation] itself first existed, they’ve been doing this for centuries,” she said. And then she changed CI’s campaign catch phrase (“Nature doesn’t need people. People need nature.”) to make her point.

“Conservation needs people. Nature needs people,” she said.

An ugly history of marginalizing indigenous and local communities living in ecosystems designated for protection has made re-gaining trust and building relationships with these groups one of the toughest aspects of conservation today.

In Part 4 of Conservation, Divided, veteran Mongabay reporter Jeremy Hance explores how the field has shifted to embrace local communities as partners in conservation — and the work that remains to be done.

Conservation, Divided is an in-depth four-part series investigating how the field of conservation has changed over the last 30 years — and the challenges it faces moving into an uncertain future. Hance completed the series over the course of eight months. Stories are running weekly between April 26 and May 17.

My five-year-old daughter loves pretending to be Yanomama. She goes outside, collects branches and leaves, and makes “food.” She turns over rocks looking for insects and watches the birds. She talks about things like poison arrow frogs and three-toed sloths. The Yanomama, or Yanomami, is a highly imperiled indigenous tribe living in the Amazon rainforest. You’d think my daughter might have learned about them from her environmental-journalist father, but in fact it was from her preschool class, which spent three weeks studying the rainforest.

My daughter loves pretending at Yanomama, but she doesn’t yet know how bad things are for the world’s indigenous tribes. Throughout history, indigenous peoples have been brutalized, belittled, and decimated by powerful interlopers. Whole groups have gone extinct, their traditions, language, and culture vanishing forever like a puff of smoke.

And the process continues. One of the most glaring — and least reported on — human rights crises today is the treatment of indigenous peoples at the hands of power-hungry governments, amoral corporations, and waves of settlers.

But conservation too has played a role. Governments have used the preservation of land and wildlife as justification to remove indigenous peoples from their homes, sometimes with the support (or simply silence) of conservation groups.

Since its beginnings, conservation has had a people problem. Indeed, the biggest internal crisis the field has faced over the last century is its treatment of local people, and most acutely indigenous people. An ugly past has made re-gaining trust and building relationships with people living near areas targeted for protection one of the toughest aspects of conservation today.

But, after a long, hard look in the mirror, the field has changed. Many conservationists and groups now embrace the establishment of indigenous reserves as one of the most innovative — and frankly effective — ways of protecting species from extinction. Many conservationists also work directly with indigenous groups, asking and listening instead of telling and demanding. But still there is much work to do.

Ugly past — and present

In the 1990s, the Botswana government began kicking San and Bakgalagadi people out of the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. Ironically, the park was created, in 1961, in part to allow the indigenous bushmen to live and hunt unmolested inside its borders, making their living as they had for millennia. It was also created to safeguard its rich wildlife. But things changed after a number of ecologists and officials raised concerns that wildlife populations were declining in the reserve. This gave the government an excuse to establish control over the bushmen and, allegedly, secure the diamonds underneath their land.

The government’s response proved, unsurprisingly, to be a human rights disaster. It forced the bushmen to resettle outside the reserve, where they must depend on government handouts for survival. Security forces have routinely beaten them for attempting to return to hunt or forage in their homeland (though wealthy trophy hunters can pay to shoot animals inside the park: they are exempt from the national hunting ban that applies to locals). Today, the San and Bakgalagadi are still waging a legal war to return to the land their ancestors called home.

Botswana’s bushmen are hardly alone in being subject to abuse or displacement in the name of conservation, typically to make way for a new protected area or to shield wildlife from traditional hunting. Indeed, when one of the first modern protected areas — Yosemite National Park in California — was established, the people who lived there, the Miwok tribe, were killed or forced out over a period of decades.

It’s almost impossible to know the full extent of conservation’s impact on locals, but one paper estimated that as many as 14 million people in Africa alone have become “conservation refugees” since the beginning of modern conservation, including the Maasai of eastern Africa, who were pushed off their traditional grazing lands to make way for many of the parks that foreign tourists enjoy today. India’s government also admits to over a million, most of them moved to protect tigers. But few other hard numbers exist.

“The problem for indigenous peoples is this kind of conservation is ‘conservation without humans’ or ‘conservation that avoids people,’” said Mina Susana Setra, an activist from the Dayak tribe in Indonesian Borneo who works for the rights NGO the Indigenous Peoples’ Alliance of the Archipelagos. “[It] promotes only nature, flora and fauna, but not humans.”

She pointed to the ongoing “Nature is Speaking” campaign by the NGO Conservation International (CI) as a good example of this kind of thinking, with its message at the end of every video that “Nature doesn’t need people. People need nature.”

Setra told me, via email, that the Indonesian government has “copied” this style of conservation and “disregard[ed] our own community based ‘conservation’ system.”

She said this has led to numerous indigenous groups being moved out of their territories to make way for national parks in the country, such as the Dongi-Dongi people for the creation Lore Lindu National Park in Sulawesi, the Banding Agung for Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park in Sumatra, and the Kasepuhan Karang for Mount Halimun Salak National Park in Java.

“The Kasepuhan Karang now struggle to carry out economic and cultural practices that have sustained them for generations,” said Setra, who pointed out that the indigenous group had lived on land for over 600 years that is now a part of the park.

In part, this ugly history between conservation and indigenous peoples grew out of the fact that many early conservation schemes were started by European colonial governments, which not only exploited their colonies’ material wealth, but also valued their wild riches. Racism, of course, also played a major role. Invaders and governments depicted indigenous peoples (and some still do today) as backward, other, and requiring re-education and conversion to western religion and lifestyles in a bid to save their heathen souls — and steal their land.

At the same time, governments worldwide have used conservation as an excuse to remove, debilitate, or simply exterminate indigenous groups, including as a tactic in the U.S. government’s war against Native Americans that lasted into the twentieth century. But conservationists themselves are hardly blameless, having long advocated for parks overlapping indigenous areas and — at least in the past — viewing indigenous peoples as grave threats to nature rather than as protectors.

Conservationists began by propagating the idea that true wilderness must be emptied of people, according to Jonathan Mazower, Advocacy Director for Survival International, a London-based activist organization devoted to indigenous groups.

“A prevalent view among conservationists has been that all human presence poses a direct threat to the natural environment, and that certain areas need to be returned to ‘wilderness’ by evicting people from their land,” he told me through a spokesperson.

He called this view of wilderness “a colonial idea based on [a] false assumption,” since such lands had “been managed by indigenous peoples for millennia.”

Most of the world’s so-called wildernesses have been inhabited for tens of thousands of years, at least. Really the only wildernesses on the planet left unshaped by people by the time the Polynesians conquered the Pacific around 1000 AD were Antarctica and the deep sea. Today with climate change, ocean acidification, and trawling nothing remains unaffected.

Still, Don Weeden, director of the Bedford Hills, New York-based Weeden Foundation, which supports wildlife-conservation projects, asserted that the belief that indigenous groups have been gravely harmed by conservation in the past arises from looking at the unfortunate exceptions, not the general rule.

“You take any sort of set of policies and actions and you’re always going to find those that had unintended consequences or perhaps are a little misguided, but those are fairly rare and [do] not typify traditional conservation,” he told me.

While experts debate the extent of the impact and damage, very few dispute that bad things have been done to indigenous and local people in the name of conservation.

Conservation groups wake up

After over a century of similarly repeated abuses, the conservation world had an awakening — of sorts. In part, this was promoted by a growing awareness among conservationists and a sometimes-painful recognition of past sins. But there were also failed projects to reckon with and mounting research showing that indigenous peoples were often as good or better protectors of their lands than establishing formal protected areas.

The longtime approach of evicting people from their homelands in order to make way for wildlife — often described as “guns and fences” or “fortress conservation” — came under fire. The first real sign of evolution came in 1975. That’s when the World Parks Congress, a decadal conference organized by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), adopted a resolution that recognized the rights of indigenous and traditional people.

Growing political empowerment of indigenous tribes around the world furthered the process, according to Fred Nelson, executive director of the Burlington, Vermont-based Maliasili Initiatives, an NGO that works with conservation groups in Africa to link human needs and environmental benefits.

Nelson pointed to greater recognition and some territorial rights granted to indigenous peoples across South America, Australia, and Canada, beginning in the 1990s. Not only were conservationists realizing they were in the wrong to marginalize indigenous groups, but in many parts of the world indigenous groups were rising up and demanding a say.

“[They] forced conservation to change and work more collaboratively with indigenous people that are securing clear rights over their territory, as well as much more influence in development and policy processes,” said Nelson.

On the academic side, Nelson touted the work of the late Nobel Prize-winning political economist Elinor Ostrom, who studied how some communities have been able to sustainably manage ecosystems over long periods of time.

Today, most big conservation groups have developed policies for working with indigenous groups and many conservationists have begun to see them as partners, and sometimes even as mentors. Out of this have come not only dynamic partnerships between conservationists and local people, but also new and arguably better methods of protecting wildlife and wild lands that are becoming de rigeur in the field. These include so-called “community conservation” projects and expanding land rights for indigenous people.

Traditional, new, and community conservation

Attitudes towards indigenous and local people began changing just before the rise, in the last three decades, of a new philosophy in conservation. “New conservation,” as it has been called, focuses on how nature benefits people and their economic concerns. Its methods include developing certification schemes to promote more sustainably produced commodities, payment for ecosystem services schemes that aim to get the market or government to pay to maintain ecosystems for the services they provide humanity, and partnering with the world’s biggest industries in order to stem the damage they do.

The new philosophy rose to the fore in a number of large conservation NGOs, such as CI, the Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). And it jibed nicely with the new way of thinking about indigenous and local people as partners in conservation.

“We understand that you cannot conserve wildlife at the expense of people, that ultimately the social and environmental dimensions at the landscape level go hand-in-hand,” Deon Nel, WWF-International’s Global Conservation Director, told me.

Still, according to Nelson, new conservation isn’t responsible for conservationists’ shift in thinking about local and indigenous people. Rather, it is a partial product of that awakening.

“[The shift] has happened in 1,000 different ways in 1,000 different places around the world, and has gradually accumulated into systemic changes within conservation thought and practice,” said Nelson.

He added that new conservation programs today are “partly a function of the gradual recognition that conservation must, to be successful, speak to the needs and interests of rural communities around the world — who are ultimately the majority of conservationists on the ground.”

Nelson argued that more traditional views of conservation — such as the mandate to preserve nature as a moral and cultural good — are a “post-colonial way of thinking and acting” and simply do not work in places like eastern and southern Africa where his organization operates.

“[It is] an operational dead-end to think that poor farmers in Mozambique or Rwanda should sacrifice their well-being and life options because conservationists in the US or Europe value the existence of wild animals in Africa,” he said. “For most people in rural Africa who actually encounter them, elephants and lions are terrifying. And unless those people receive countervailing value or benefit, it is ludicrous to expect people to want to have them around. So making wildlife valuable to those people is, to me, the frontlines of conservation in Africa.”

While the rise of new conservation has also led to impassioned debate over its efficacy and approach, the people problem is one of the few areas where new conservationists and traditionalists are generally in agreement.

For example, although traditional conservationists largely focus not on people but rather on protecting wild lands and wildlife, some work closely with locals, seeing them as the best resource in protecting endangered species and places.

Noga Shanee, co-founder of the NGO Neotropical Primate Conservation (NPC), told me that while her group is strictly traditional in its aim to protect species in northern Peru, it depends on local people to instigate its activities. “The communities we work with are doing most of the conservation work themselves. They chose the areas they want to conserve and are doing so to the best of their abilities,” she said.

NPC works with farmers to develop their own community-conservation parks, something she said the locals are eager to do. Community conservation means that locals, rather than NGOs or governments, are the top decision-makers and set up their own rules governing their protected area. However, in order to work they also must convince the government to recognize their parks.

“Many of the projects we are working with had actively looked for an organization that would help them realize their dreams. We didn’t need to convince them and definitely not fight them,” Shanee explained.

The upsides of working in this way are undeniable, according to Shanee. “These reserves are much more respected by the local communities…and some suffer from lower deforestation rates than the state-run ones.”

But Shanee cautioned that the Peruvian government makes it needlessly difficult for community conservationists to succeed, likely because it doesn’t like to forfeit control of the land. “Local people just can’t deal with the paperwork and payments themselves,” she said of Peru’s onerous bureaucracy around community conservation. “I am sure that it is completely intentional.”

This lack of support can lead to violence. Shanee noted that local people working with her group have been socially outcast, and even been subjected to kidnappings and death threats. Local environmentalists and indigenous leaders often risk it all when they stand up to governments or industry for the environment. According to the international environmental and human rights NGO Global Witness, at least 1,024 environmental and land activists were assassinated or murdered between 2002 and 2014.

Community conservation is, of course, also happening at organizations that have tilted towards new conservation in recent years. CI started out focused wholly on biodiversity, but the group did a major shift over the last decade or so to focus its mission around people, specifically how nature helps people.

At Bird’s Head Seascape off the coast of West Papua in Indonesia, CI helped set up locally managed conservation areas. The group says the project effectively cut illegal fishing by 90 percent and increased dive tourism, bringing in revenue for locals. (CI was also the first large conservation NGO to put an indigenous person on its board of directors, Megaron with the Kayapo tribe of Brazil.)

Still, research on the effectiveness of community conservation is somewhat mixed. While there are many positive and effective programs out there, community conservation also faces challenges, such as skeptical governments, lower than expected economic benefits, local governance problems, and often a single-species focus that leaves other wildlife out. In short, many of the same issues that can trip up conservation in general also threaten the success of community conservation.

Indigenous land rights: conservation’s Holy Grail?

Conservationists have recently begun realizing that indigenous territories and indigenous land rights are potentially game-changing conservation tools. Indigenous territories, called indigenous protected areas in Australia, are places where the government legally recognizes an indigenous group’s right to the land, allowing the group to manage it collectively.

According to a report called Common Ground released in March by an Oxfam-led trio of NGOs, around 50 percent of land on Earth is claimed by “customary land users” — indigenous or local people who have been living on and using the land for a certain amount of time. However, the report notes that ownership of just 10 percent has been legally recognized. The majority of this is in just five countries: the main one, Brazil, where indigenous territories cover about 110 million hectares or 13 percent of the land, as well as Australia, Canada, Mexico, and China. (Reservations for indigenous groups in the US are not included in this list as they may or may not be part of traditional territory, represent a vast reduction of what was historically occupied, and were often forced on native Americans after decades of war and broken pledges.)

In most of the world indigenous and local people do not have any legal rights to their land. In Africa, for instance, the World Bank estimates that 90 percent of community-run rural land is currently unrecognized by governments, leading to a plague of land grabbing on the continent.

Conservationists are belatedly recognizing what has long been obvious to indigenous activists: that instead of threatening nature, tribal ways of life cause far less harm to the environment than Western lifestyles and that tribes are incredibly effective protectors of their land.

“Forest for Indigenous Peoples is the resource for everything; connection to the spirits of their ancestors that continuously guide the way through millennia; food and water for their generation and the next to come; shelter for their peoples; medicines for those who are sick; cultural defense in the dynamic and changing world; a dignity and identity in the crisis of value, that makes them proud to be indigenous,” Setra said. “It is their home and they would die fighting to keep it safe.”

Indeed, a growing body of research shows that indigenous territories are often as good as strict protected areas at stemming deforestation and in some cases they are even better. And there’s so much potentially claimable high-biodiversity land that vast tracts could be protected and managed by indigenous stewards, rather than by governments; but they would still be respected by governments, which could make all the difference.

“Certainly, I think that all of us in the conservation field have recognized that indigenous peoples have an important role to play in conservation and that indigenous reserves make a lot of sense,” said Weeden.

Given this, many conservationists are now promoting the concept of indigenous land rights, contributing expertise to land-rights movements, and helping set territorial boundaries through mapping. In some cases they are helping manage indigenous territories once they are set up, usually taking a back seat to indigenous leaders.

“Those of us who have been in the conservation movement for a long time have always engaged in such activities because experienced conservationists who work in the field in the remote corners of our planet know that you can’t succeed without partnering with people,” said Russell Mittermeier, CI’s Executive Vice-Chair and past president, and a renowned tropical forest conservation scientist.

Legal title allows indigenous peoples much greater latitude to keep industries — such as logging, mining, and fossil fuels — out of their land. It gives them the ability to turn to the government if squatters or land grabbers infiltrate their land. It also allows them, if they wish, to establish strict protected areas on their land.

“It is basically impossible for local communities to practice conservation if they do not have legal rights over their land and territories; they cannot control their environment without such rights,” explained Nelson by email. “The conservation community needs to become MUCH more pro-active around community land rights reform than it has been.”

Of course, legal land title for local groups also comes with risks for conservation. One is that indigenous or local owners could decide to allow industry into their land at some later date. For example, in Papua New Guinea, ruthless companies have used bribery, intimidation, and even force to get at forests that supposedly belong to the communities living there.

Another risk is that as populations rise and needs change over time, indigenous groups could begin to impact their environments more severely. Indeed, research has shown that the extinction of megafauna across all continents except Africa around 10,000 years ago (think woolly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and woolly rhinos) was not due to climate change but to small groups of hunter-gatherers wiping out most of the large, slow-breeding animals. It may be that if the global population continues to grow at its current staggering rate, and if forests continue to be overhunted and oceans overfished, there will be no easy choices left. These are the sorts of fears that keep conservationists awake at night.

But proponents of indigenous territories as a conservation tool — and not just as a human rights issue — say that indigenous peoples are much less likely to invite industry into their forests than governments are, and that given their centuries of knowledge and tradition they will remain far better protectors of the forest than wildlife rangers and fences.

One way to confront conservation concerns is for indigenous territories to specifically stipulate broader protections for nature. Mittermeier pointed to Suriname, where indigenous communities declared a massive conservation corridor spanning 7.2 million hectares (28,000 square miles) last year with support from both CI and WWF-Guianas. “This is an area about the size of Ireland and is inhabited by only about 3,000 people living in eight communities,” said Mittermeier.

This indigenous area not only protects the tribes living there, but also specifically protects natural resources like rivers in its agreement.

For Dayak activist Setra, the one thing the Indonesian government must do “before all other things” is to grant indigenous people the legal rights to their land.

“Our call is: support community mapping and recognize Indigenous territories and collective lands and provide strong, secure legal protections for the people who protect forest, nature and environment,” she said.

Still, this battle for land-title recognition has also bumped up against one of the biggest conservation initiatives developed over the last few decades. The UN’s Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) program would pay developing countries — and potentially local communities — to keep forests standing in order to mitigate climate change. But many indigenous groups view REDD+ as just another way for governments and big conservation NGOs to grab power over their forests — as a rerun of national parks co-opting their land. A number of indigenous groups have battled hard to keep REDD+ out of their forests, while others contend that the long, bureaucratic process has left them out in the cold when they were hoping to benefit economically from the program.

REDD+ falls decidedly under the new conservation banner. And although new conservation touts itself as being all about people, it appears to dwell in a paradox. On the one hand, new conservation at its core views people, and especially economic benefits for them, as essential to moving conservation forward. But at the same time, payment for ecosystem services programs like REDD+ have not only proven difficult to implement but have begun to alienate some of the indigenous groups on whose environments certain programs would rely.

New conservation has further been seen as undercutting its people-first message via its emphasis on partnerships with powerful industries and massive corporations, including some of the world’s largest mining and fossil fuel companies with ugly records when it comes to indigenous communities and locals. For example, one of CI’s partners, Chevron, is currently embroiled in a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit with several indigenous communities in Ecuador over oil spills and pollution that the company inherited when it merged with Texaco. The case has taken numerous twists and turns, but indigenous communities contend that Chevron has falsified evidence and paid off officials to avoid paying court-ordered reparations. Still, CI remains partners with the oil giant.

Traditional protected areas and saving wildlife

Of course, given traditional conservationists’ longtime focus on wildlife and wild places over people, it’s even easier to criticize them for overlooking human needs — and doing so for over a century.

But Weeden, who has a degree in public health and worked in the aid sector in developing countries, told me the story is more complex. He said allegations that old-school conservationists are “elitists” or “don’t care about human suffering or poverty” are “false.”

“It’s not being anti-human at all, it’s just caring passionately about the 10 to 15 million other species,” he said.

And, in an age where extractive industries are moving farther afield to gain access to dwindling natural resources, conservationists and indigenous people now sometimes find themselves both supporting strict protected areas. Paul Salaman, the CEO of the Virginia-based traditional conservation group the Rainforest Trust, told me he sees more and more indigenous groups embracing, not fighting, traditional protected areas as a way to keep corporations and settlers out, especially if they are involved in the process.

“There are a number of indigenous communities that welcome strict protected areas adjacent to their land, and as much as anything to avoid companies, oil palm growers, timber companies, gold miners…coming in and destroying that area,” he said.

He pointed to the Rainforest Trust’s work with the Matsés indigenous peoples in Peru. After the group helped the Matsés establish an indigenous reserve, the Matsés supported setting aside adjacent land as a strict nature reserve, according to Salaman. In 2009, the Rainforest Trust and its local partner, CEDIA, helped found the Matsés National Reserve, covering over 1 million acres.

“And we were just in time,” said Salaman, adding that there might otherwise have been a gold rush in the area.

Indeed, strict protected areas are not always a bad outcome for people living nearby. Research has shown that communities close to protected areas are actually better off than similar communities far away, providing further evidence that traditional conservation can benefit people — so long as they are included in the discussions and their rights respected.

“There are no forest rights without forest,” Phil Dickie, a spokesperson for WWF-International told me. “So protection matters.”

Even wildlife-focused conservation efforts can benefit locals, too. Andrew Terry with Jersey-Island-based Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust said that his organization, which focuses wholly on saving incredibly endangered species from extinction, has found that its efforts often help people living nearby.

For example, Durrell’s Madagascar pochard project has delivered a number of benefits to local Malagasy people. Durrell is working to restore La Sofia wetlands and lake as a place of future release for the Critically Endangered Madagascar pochard (Aythya innotata) — a duck that has a global population of around 100, three-quarters of it in captivity. The wetlands around the lake suffer from widespread deforestation on the banks, siltation, poor water quality, low biodiversity, and exotic fish, said Terry, who pointed out that even so, this freshwater ecosystem is among the most ecologically healthy in central Madagascar.

Durrell is now working with locals to enhance water quality and better manage the wetlands by improving livestock management, diversifying crops, and supporting primary education, among other tactics. Many of these activities are new-conservation-style programs, and Terry said his group, although largely traditional in its outlook, will employ any tool it determines will help get the job of saving species done. In addition to the immediate benefits of improved agriculture and education, the project will ultimately benefit the local populace by providing cleaner water and improved local freshwater fisheries.

“Species are intrinsically connected to their broader environments — one cannot save a species without considering the pressures acting on their ecosystem and the other elements that make up that ecosystem,” said Terry. “We believe, and can demonstrate, that a focus on species can actually bring people together and bring a focus to address whole ecosystem problems.”

In other words, even wildlife-focused conservation can benefit local communities, simply by improving the health of the environment and working with locals as partners. Durrell didn’t get involved in the area because of the poverty of locals, but because of a nearly extinct duck. In the end, though, both may well see a better future.

Can emphasis on people go too far?

As the notion of including local and indigenous communities in conservation decisions has gained traction, it has also received some pushback. John Payne, head of the Borneo Rhino Alliance, said that sometimes efforts to work with and appease every local or so-called stakeholder group have “gone beyond a joke.”

“Years can go by while all that talking is going on, and attrition of forests and animal populations occurs, potentially to the point of total loss. In the long run, little of biological value will be saved by the consultation process, and we will still have lots of poor and disadvantaged people,” Payne told me.

He pointed to the establishment of two parks in Malaysian Borneo as examples, Tabin National Park in 1984 and Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary in 1997. “Neither of those protected areas would have been established if there was a stakeholder consultation process along the lines that we imagine has to be done nowadays,” he said.

Tabin National Park would have likely been derailed by a local village and logging interests, according to Payne. As for Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary, he said locals almost universally opposed the park and it only went through due to the will of a handful of government officials.

Today, however, the local view of Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary has done a complete 180, according to Payne. Locals now see the park as one of their only economic alternatives in a region drowning in monoculture plantations — and one of the last reminders of a bygone world.

“There is regret that the bulk of the region is oil-palm plantations, whose owners live far from the region, and whose labor force is foreign,” he said, adding that, today, eco-tourism in the park provides at least some locals with a different career path.

In Payne’s view, the lesson is that people in the area simply couldn’t imagine that most of the forest they had lived off for generations could be transformed into oil palm, so the value of establishing a reserve was unclear. That’s typical, he said. Establishing new protected areas sometimes requires the “leadership and persistence of a few people, against the views of the majority.”

Shanee with NPC also cautioned that conservationists must be wary of local expectations. She said her group does not work with communities if their primary goal is economic improvement — locals fixated on the idea that REDD+ will bring in money, for instance.

“Some people really believe that if they will conserve land, money will instantly come pouring in,” she said. “This is the result of the very confusing and problematic discourses of these kinds of schemes.”

But this is often how such schemes are sold to local and indigenous people: conservation will make you wealthier, conservation will bring you economic improvement, conservation will help your family. While conservationists may desperately want that to be true, the reality is much more complex. Potential economic benefits often take years of hard work to materialize — if they ever do — as in the case of ecotourism ventures, handicraft and other small-scale commercial enterprises, or payment for ecosystem services programs.

Once people realize they won’t become rich, they “get back to their normal activities, which are usually quite destructive,” Shanee added.

Instead, NPC works with communities who want to protect nature for other reasons — their spirituality, a commitment to sustainability, or the chance to gain greater recognition by the government and the broader Peruvian society among them. Certainly, economic betterment may come as a result, but it must not be the focus, said Shanee, or conservationists risk alienating local people.

Controversy persists

For all the progress, the relationship between conservationists and local people remains complicated. Memories of past abuse persist and locals continue to lodge accusations of elitism, disrespect, and stealing traditional land for protected areas.

Even when conservationists want to work in partnership with locals, they sometimes face bad decisions by governments that treat indigenous peoples as second-class citizens or want to grab power over minority groups.

Any notion that the conflict between conservation and indigenous and local people has ended is naïve, according to Mazower with Survival International.

“Many of the big conservation organizations — WWF, the Wildlife Conservation Society, Conservation International, African Wildlife Foundation, and the Nature Conservancy — are guilty of abusing tribal peoples’ rights,” he said. “They never speak out against evictions, they fund projects that violate tribal rights, and they treat complaints like ours as public relations ‘issues’ rather than acting swiftly.”

The group recently lodged a formal complaint with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development against WWF for its alleged links to abuse of Baka indigenous people in Cameroon. The complaint charges that WWF helped set up a series of protected areas without proper consent from the Baka, and that protected-area rangers, largely funded by WWF, have destroyed Baka homes and threatened them with violence.

However, Dickie, the WWF-International spokesperson, rejected these claims. He said that not only did WWF outperform formal requirements for establishing a protected area in the region, but also spent five years working with local communities to refine the park proposal based on their input, paying particular attention to involving politically and socially marginalized community members.

He added that WWF has been funding human-rights training for all ecoguards since 2006. “Investigation of incidents is difficult, particularly in the absence of detail, but where WWF has been able to verify any incidents of abuse involving ecoguards, it has taken the issue up with the ministry and other stakeholders. Some of those interventions do seem to have had some impact,” Dickie said.

The situation here is volatile and complex. Working in parts of the world like Cameroon — where poverty, conflict, and lack of governance prevail — forces conservationists to walk a tightrope between the desires to preserve species, protect forests, and mitigate human suffering.

The region is home to both the Baka (who lived in the forests for generations) and Bantu-speaking farmers who hold most of the local political power. Add to that a recent influx of war refugees from the Central African Republic and navigating tribal tensions becomes a constant difficulty. At the same time, poaching has become increasingly militarized, Dickie said, and some Baka have become involved, especially in killing elephants. But like so many poor, marginalized groups, the Baka are only being used as foot soldiers in the war over wildlife, acting on orders from more powerful actors, he said.

Dickie insisted WWF is doing what it can to improve life for both the Baka and the Bantu while also safeguarding wildlife, including working with Baka community organizations, helping to set up community policing initiatives, and increasing the number of Baka rangers. (Until recently the Cameroonian government permitted only Bantu to become rangers.)

“Unfortunately, we have trouble matching what [elephant] poachers are prepared to pay,” said Dickie.

WWF has policies governing how it engages with indigenous groups that recognize them as “key stewards” of their land and make “special efforts” to secure their rights. And Dickie added that “WWF has for some considerable time been trying to see if Survival is prepared to collaborate on initiatives which could benefit the Baka” — so far to no avail.

But Mazower contended that while WWF’s and other conservation groups’ policies “sound excellent on paper” they are “often ignored in practice.” He charged that big conservation groups continuously choose industry, corporations, and tourism over indigenous people.

And he is not alone in his critique of today’s conservation. For all the work going on with locals and indigenous groups, many conservationists still have a mindset that hasn’t moved much beyond the nineteenth century, according to Shanee.

“I think conservation had changed a lot in its discourses, but very little in essence,” she said, pointing out that many early parks were established to secure game animals for wealthy big-game-hunting colonists. She said this privileged mentality still exists in many conservation circles today.

“Local farmers trying to save their crops or feed their families are called poachers, whilst rich white people killing for amusement is perceived as a noble conservation effort,” Shanee said, referring to the support of groups like WWF and IUCN for trophy hunting under certain conditions. “It is a racist, socially unjust concept which alienates local people from conservation.”

Even the rush to develop eco-tourism projects, which are often billed as income-generators for locals, can suffer from the same attitude, according to Shanee: a focus on wealthy, privileged westerners over the people who actually live in the area.

“They launder the idea a bit better these days with names such as ‘Integrated Conservation and Development Program,’” she said, but “the idea is basically the same, conservation is largely used as a justification for territorialism.”

But Nelson said that in Africa, at least, eco-tourism is really the only thing keeping wildlife alive. “Where westerners may see Serengeti National Park through the lens of a precious global heritage set aside in perpetuity, the reason that the Serengeti is generally well managed and receives so much investment, is that it is an extraordinarily valuable commodity through tourism,” he explained.

Same thing with the mountain gorillas in Rwanda and Uganda. “They have not only survived but increased through years of political crisis and war in that region, because they are such a valuable commodity to those countries — a single gorilla trekking permit now is sold by the government for $750! — and this is what generates the highest level of often-elusive ‘political will’ to protect them,” Nelson said. “Those few hundred gorillas literally underpin Rwanda’s entire tourism industry.”

Conservation will only succeed in Africa if it “speaks to the social, economic, and political aspirations of African people and societies — [if] it takes those away then conservation will lose,” according to Nelson.

Nature needs people?

Given the ongoing messiness of conservation today, it might be time to consult experts from different fields, according to Terry with Durrell

“It is a real mistake to look at approaches developed by humanitarian aid specialists or sociologists and think that we as biologists know how to apply them effectively. We need to see stronger collaborations with other sectors,” he said.

As conservationists have demanded more and more of themselves — and had more and more demands placed on them by governments and the public — they have often failed to acknowledge that maybe, just maybe, they can’t do it all. Certainly, not well. I mean, just preventing mass extinction is a pretty tall order. So perhaps it is time to start working with experts far and wide. Not just economists and business leaders, but psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, trauma specialists in conflict areas, and of course indigenous and local community leaders.

Conservation’s people problem is not solved, not fully. And, given the very nature of conservation, there may always be tensions. According to Setra, we all may need to rethink how we view nature and how we think of our own species.

Indigenous peoples “have been and still are in many cases, the true conservationist, long before [conservation] itself first existed, they’ve been doing this for centuries,” she said. And then she changed CI’s campaign catch phrase (“Nature doesn’t need people. People need nature.”) to make her point.

“Conservation needs people. Nature needs people,” she said.

CORRECTION 6/30/16: This story has been updated to reflect the fact that there has been no gold rush in the region of Peru’s Matsés National Reserve. A previous version quoted Paul Salaman, CEO of the Rainforest Trust, stating erroneously that there has been one.

Animals like the North-Chinese leopard, Alpaga, Snow Leopard, Corsac Fox, Bharals, reptiles like the Rhinocerus Iguana, Aldabra giant tortoise, Nile crocodile and other species are attractions at the zoo.","[{'DATE', '1793'}, {'today', 'DATE'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'France', 'GPE'}, {'Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'1793 today', 'DATE'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'France', 'GPE'}, {'Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'North Chinese', 'NORP'}, {'August 16, 2015', 'DATE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'Alpaca', 'GPE'}, {'August 16, 2015', 'DATE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'August 16, 2015', 'DATE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'August 16, 2015', 'DATE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'ORDINAL', 'second'}, {'Rhinoceros', 'GPE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'the National Assembly', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', '1793'}, {'PERSON', 'Menagerie'}, {'Versailles', 'GPE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Nile', 'LOC'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'the Jardin des Plantes', 'ORG'}, {'Paris', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'the first three decades of the 19th century'}, {'Europe', 'LOC'}, {'North-Chinese', 'NORP'}, {'Alpaga', 'ORG'}, {'Snow Leopard', 'PERSON'}, {'PERSON', 'Corsac Fox'}, {'Bharals', 'GPE'}, {'Rhinocerus', 'NORP'}, {'Nile', 'LOC'}]","['Paris', 'France', 'Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'France', 'Jardin des Plantes', 'North Chinese', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'Alpaca', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'Rhinoceros', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'the National Assembly', 'Versailles', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Nile', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'the Jardin des Plantes', 'Paris', 'Europe', 'North-Chinese', 'Alpaga', 'Bharals', 'Rhinocerus', 'Nile']"
0,"If your children or grandchildren are intrigued with “critters,” two unusual attractions in Snohomish County offer up-close experiences with exotic animals far beyond neighborhood dogs and cats. The Outback Kangaroo Farm in Arlington and The Reptile Zoo in Monroe both feature amazing collections of unusual animals with an emphasis on educating visitors about their special menageries.

At the Outback Kangaroo Farm, kids can see kangaroos, wallaroos, wallabies, llamas, alpacas, lemurs, pygmy goats, mini-donkeys, ostriches, emus, parrots, three kinds of peacocks and – new this year – a Patagonian cavy. Also known as the Patagonian mara or Patagonian hare, this large herbivorous rodent comes from the far south of Argentina.

The Outback Kangaroo Farm is open on a seasonal basis, offering educational, guided tours from March 1 through Oct. 30, Wednesday through Sunday. Four tours a day are led by one of the farm’s owners, Ray and Joey Strom. They thoroughly enjoy sharing their knowledge of all their unusual animals with visitors, who can get “up close and personal” with certain critters. Kids love the opportunity to pet a wallaby or alpaca.

The guided tours are offered at 10 a.m., noon, 2 p.m., and 4 p.m. Admission is $9 for children ages 2-12, $10 for adults and $8 for seniors. Group rates are also available for parties of 15 or more at $7 per person. Reservations are encouraged during the busy summer months.

The Reptile Zoo near Monroe features a distinctly more adventurous encounter with exotic critters – it boasts the most extensive collection of reptiles in the Pacific Northwest. These include the world’s 10 deadliest snakes among its 150 creatures. Some of the non-snake critters are an albino alligator, two-headed turtle, bearded dragon lizard, rhinoceros iguana and the world’s largest spiders and centipedes.

Boys in particular love the “gross-out” factor of the snakes. Here they – and any brave visitor – can hold a snake and pet an alligator. Designated “holding” snakes include the rosy boa and Burmese python – but not the black mamba, the world’s deadliest snake.

Zoologist and educator Scott Petersen, known as The Reptile Man, founded his Reptile Zoo in 1996 to further his goal of educating others about such creatures. Formerly a high school biology teacher, Scott continues his educational focus both at The Reptile Zoo and by providing reptile presentations at schools and other venues. He has performed for more than 800 schools, festivals, corporate parties and other events. Scott has been featured on Disney’s Bill Nye The Science Guy and PBS’s Biz Kids.



His son, Isaac Petersen, now handles the daily operation of The Reptile Zoo, which is open year-round every day except Thanksgiving and Christmas. Located on Highway 2 just east of the town of Monroe, The Reptile Zoo is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $8 per adult and $6.50 per child (ages 3-17).

Both The Reptile Zoo and the Outback Kangaroo Farm also host children’s birthday parties and other special events; check their websites for private event information.

0,"Dogs and cats have been bred for centuries to be our companions; that’s why they make great pets. But more and more people around the world are instead choosing creatures like chinchillas, dingoes, and foxes as pets — while knowing very little about them.

Trouble is, some of these exotic animals don’t live well with us. Chimps, for example, are cute as babies, but then grow into extremely strong — sometimes aggressive — adults. Other exotics are finicky eaters and need lots of space to roam and play. Sadly, exotic animal ownership often ends with abandonment when humans can’t (or don’t know how to) care for the creatures anymore.

In May, a group of researchers in the Netherlands published a systematic ranking of animals’ suitability as pets, to aid public understanding and improve animal welfare.

The researchers came up with a list of 90 mammals — combining data from an internet survey in the Netherlands, as well as information on animal confiscations from homes and a few other public data sources (also included: animals that appear at petting zoos).

For fun, I scrolled to the bottom of the list — to the least desirable pets. The research was done in the Netherlands, but the exotic animal trade is increasingly global. So no matter where you live, you’ll want to avoid these 25 mammals that make terrible pets.

25) American black bear

First off, know that these rankings are based on subjective judgments from experts. The exact order isn’t so important; it’s more so that all of these animals fall on the “probably not great as pets” side of the spectrum.

The Dutch research team had a series of experts in ecology, animal welfare, and veterinary science rank the animals in terms of suitability for living in a human home. The resulting paper, recently published in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science, has some fun surprises: Apparently wallabies, silva deer, and llamas make pretty decent pets. But there are far more that don’t.

Bears of any kind are a great example of an animal that’s probably not a great pet. You might laugh, but people have kept bears — in this country and abroad (with deadly consequences).

24) American bison

Bison eat around 24 pounds of grass a day. Do you have 24 pounds of grass? No, you don’t. Don’t get a pet bison. (Look at these pictures of a bison living in a home in Dallas. It barely fits.)

23) Arctic fox

Damn, these are adorable. But as Popular Science explains, when it comes to keeping foxes as pets, it’s important to know these animals may be tamed, but they are not domesticated. Tamed animals have been trained to live with humans. Domesticated animals have been bred, for centuries perhaps, to live with humans. Tamed animals are always going to be more dangerous.

22) Leopard cat

Leopard cats are regal as all get-out. But know these cats would rather hunt rodents in the wild than eat than eat store-bought cat food.

21) Dingo

Lest you forget.

20) Thirteen-lined ground squirrel

A commenter on the blog Squirrel Awareness writes this story of trying to raise a 13-lined squirrel as a pet:

I've noticed she grunts at me when approaching her cage. And for the past week when transferring her from indoor to outdoor cage, she climbs on my shoulder and tries to pull out my hair. And when I try to discourage her, she scratches. I'm beginning to fear her.

19) Plains zebra

People the world over love zebras. But often owning them is illegal. According to Slate, “if you can't wait to buy a zebra, move to West Virginia or Wisconsin. These states have few restrictions on exotic-pet ownership, and you don't need permission from the local governments to start a zebra farm.”

18) Crab-eating raccoon

The clue should be in this creature’s name. This pet requires other pets. Where are you going to get the crabs, lobsters, and turtle eggs that this creature likes to eat? They’re also nocturnal.

17) Black-eared opossum

This picture says it all.

16) South American coati

According to exoticpets.about.com: “Children should not be allowed to play with coati. Coati can bite, especially if they don't want you to do something, making unsuspecting children an obvious target. To sum this all up, coati are not good pets for most people.”

15) Egyptian fruit bat

If you have a pet bat, I will never come over to your house. Never. Ever.

Also, these animals deserve to fly free in the wild. The Bat World Sanctuary, a nonprofit devoted to rescuing bats, writes:

Having a pet bat might make you feel cool, but people who know better (and most of them do) feel that it is a horrible cruelty and they cringe when they see people keeping a bat as a pet. Aside from that, the act of keeping a bat as a pet will cause it to experience terror, inappropriate and damaging nutrition and terrible loneliness and boredom.

14) Long-tailed chinchilla

Chinchillas are amazingly soft and somewhat adorable. And they’re some of the more popular pets on this list. But they’re also highly social animals that need a lot of stimulation and attention. Life in a solitary cage doesn’t suit them.

And then there’s this: “Chinchillas are not cuddlers,” the consumer interest website Knoji states. “Though a well socialized chinchilla will sit on it's owners lap for a few minutes, these animals are very inquisitive by nature and will not be content to just sit as they would much rather explore the world around them.”

13) Utah prairie dog

Prairie dogs aren’t dogs. They’re rodents.

This species of prairie dog is also listed as threatened per the Endangered Species Act. Don’t remove these adorable animals from the wild.

12) Common degu

If you never heard of an animal species before (this one is new to me), you probably shouldn’t keep it as a pet.

11) Kinkajou

Ditto.

Kinkajous are native to the rainforests of Central and South America. And though they have endearing faces, know they can pack a bite. In 2011 the Associated Press reported on a Tennessee girl going to the hospital with a pet kinkajou bite:

By the next morning, the 16-year-old was battling a fever of 102, suffering severe headaches and urinating blood. Her mother rushed her to Children's Hospital at Erlanger. That's when Thurmond told her mother and doctors about the kinkajou bite. To which everyone replied, ""Kinka-what?"" ""I had never heard of the animal, and neither had the doctors,"" said Thurmond's mother, Miika Montgomery. ""I was Googling it, they were Googling it. ... If it had been a dog or a cat or a raccoon they would have known exactly what to do, but they had never seen anything like this.""

10) Raccoon

The website healthypets.com lists 10 reasons not to keep raccoons as pets. Here’s number 10:

Raccoons act out when they’re unhappy and hormonal. Their natural instinct is to bite when they’re angry, frustrated, or stressed. However, raccoon guardians also tell stories of other ways in which their little guys or gals deliver payback, including “repotting” house plants, removing buttons from clothing someone was silly enough to leave around, moving belongings to other locations and sometimes peeing on them for good measure, flipping over water bowls, dumping the contents of bookcases, and stripping the bed sheets.

9) Mexican prairie dog

8) Eurasian elk

Aka moose. I don’t care how big your backyard is, you don’t have room for moose.

7) Red fox

“Tamed red foxes are incredibly destructive to property, often have a strong musk odor, and can be dangerous to strangers or other pets,” Popular Science reports.

6) Capybara

These giant rodents are frightening. Truly frightening. But looks aside, according to capybarafacts.com:

capybaras live in groups, thus adopting one animal only will not be good. You would need to adopt at least two capybaras, but preferably more. Secondly, consider their size. They are huge. They are more than twice the size of a jackrabbit, they are the biggest rodents. Keeping at least two big rodents in good condition may be challenging and costly in itself, but besides that, they have special needs as well.

5) White-tailed prairie dog

4) Brown bear

Brown bears — which include the fearsome North American grizzly — are huge and ferocious.

(On a clear morning in April 1805, Meriwether Lewis encountered his first North American grizzly bear in Montana. He shot at the animal when it approached him menacingly. It fought back, and continued to pursue him despite its wounds. ""It was a most tremendous looking animal, and extremely hard to kill,"" Lewis recalled.)

3) Fennec fox

This thing is ridiculously adorable. Will have trouble remembering fennec foxes don’t make suitable pets.

2) Sugar glider

They’re nocturnal, with sharp claws and sharp teeth, and they pee on everything. Why do you want one?

1) Black-tailed prairie dog

There are four prairie dog species on this list. Take that as a hint. Prairie dogs are not suitable pets.

0,"SIEM REAP, Cambodia—Before dawn we set out in a small wooden boat across the largest inland lake in Southeast Asia, Tonle Sap in Cambodia. As orange began to tint the sky, the lake appeared as a sea that stretched to the horizon. Because Tonle Sap’s water levels pulse with the seasons, it is known as the beating heart of Asia. The lake feeds the legendary Mekong River, but during the monsoons, the Mekong floods, backing up into Tonle Sap, which expands six times to 6,178 square miles and inundates forests, shrubland, and grassland.

That ebb and flow has created an ecological wonderland, home to otters and rare birds like the endangered milky stork, the Bengal florican, the Sarus crane, and the giant ibis (the national bird of Cambodia). As we cross the lake, our charming guide, Kunthea, a young woman who works for Sam Veasna Center, a local conservation and ecotourism organization, points overhead to oriental darters and spot-billed pelicans, threatened elsewhere but common here.

Fish also flourish in Tonle Sap. The lake and the entire Lower Mekong Basin is the largest inland fishery in the world, the source of 18 percent of the planet’s freshwater fish catch, according to the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers. In Cambodia, fish supply 81 percent of the animal protein its citizens eat and is a staple for the hundreds of thousands of people who live on the lake in more than 170 floating villages. As we chugged by, girls combed out their hair on rocking porches, amphibious little boys hopped from boat to house with smooth grace, ducks quacked in a floating pen, and a family in a boat pulled up to a floating store selling rice, rope, and other necessities. Life in these villages looks bucolic but perhaps not long for this world.

This fecund ecosystem faces a litany of threats: overfishing, pollution, dams, and the conversion of floodplain habitats to rice fields and rubber plantations. Considering the scale of the challenges, it can seem like the lake is living on borrowed time. But there are glimmers of hope. Conservation supported by eco-tourism has succeeded in bringing species back from the brink. Scientists are studying dam and fish dynamics and pushing Mekong countries to consider the whole river basin when building dams. Local activists have had some success in changing government policies on land concessions and halting illegal logging.

Cambodia is a country still emerging from the shadow of the genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979 that resulted in the death of 2 million people, or a quarter of Cambodia’s population, before the regime was overthrown by Vietnam. No survivors escaped unscathed. The 41-year-old director of Sam Veasna Center, Orn Sambovannak, goes by Johnny, a name he was given by an English teacher at a United Nations refugee camp in which he lived from ages four to 18. Soon after, he was captured by the remnant Khmer Rouge, jailed, and then forced to fight for it for three years. When he was finally freed, he walked 55 miles home through the land-mine-studded forest.

Today, land mines laid during civil war and unexploded ordnance from U.S. carpet bombing during the Vietnam War haunt Cambodia, killing or maiming more than 100 people a year. Travelers are advised to stick to well-marked paths. Four million people a year come to see Angkor Wat, the largest religious complex on the planet, and stay in Siem Reap, which throbs with a backpackers’ party scene. Siem Reap is just an hour’s drive from the northeast side of Tonle Sap, yet ecotourism is nascent. The Sam Veasna Center takes about 1,200 people a year to its wildlife conservation sites, including Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. It’s hard to overstate the extent to which the Khmer Rouge devastated Cambodia in nearly every way: infrastructure ruined; families, health, and standard of living decimated; government institutions dismantled. Rebuilding has been a slow process. Tourism is one economic bright spot that also celebrates Khmer culture (the people of Cambodia are mostly Khmer) and natural heritage.

THE FISH LIFE

People who live on the lake are at a far remove from Siem Reap’s drink specials, pounding beats, and elephant-print harem pants. Their lives revolve around fishing, but these days they are catching fewer and smaller fish. Overfishing may be part of the problem, but it’s hard to quantify because scientists haven’t been counting the vast numbers of fish that people catch and feed to their families, said Simon Mahood, a Cambodia-based ecologist and senior technical adviser for the Wildlife Conservation Society, which partners with Sam Veasna Center on conservation.

The national government’s fisheries administration is advocating fish farms as a way to help feed a growing population, and some people on Tonle Sap have small pens, lively with fish, adjacent to their floating houses. Yet across Cambodia, aquaculture produces just 20 percent of the overall catch, underlining the importance of protecting and managing wild fish stocks that supply the other 80 percent, said Eric Baran, senior scientist for WorldFish, an international research organization. Baran is based in Phnom Penh and collaborates with government agriculture and fisheries offices.

Water levels in the lake are decreasing, which also affects fish stocks. This year’s El Niño had a stark impact, said Orn. “Normally in August the water level should be at least five meters,” he said, “but it’s approximately two to three meters.” In the rainy season the lake is typically 12 meters deep.

“These guys on the floating villages don’t have other options,” said Mahood. “You catch fish or you catch fish. This year, a lot of those people couldn’t catch fish.” As a result, he said, many are leaving the lake for factories or labor jobs in Phnom Penh or Thailand. “Things don’t always happen gradually with change,” said Mahood. “There are tipping points. Once people have a very bad year, a lot of them just won’t come back because they don’t want to take the risk. It may not be enjoyable working in a factory, but it’s a guaranteed income. Fishing is not.”

LAND GRABS

Another big threat, both to fisheries and to biodiversity, is habitat loss. Around 2000, the national government began granting 99-year land leases to foreign companies to log forests to grow sugarcane and rubber. In addition to removing critical habitat, some of these projects have changed the hydrology in Tonle Sap’s catchment. Water seeps into the denuded ground instead of funneling into a river that supplies the lake. “Most of them cut down the trees and sell the trees, and just leave it and don’t grow anything,” said Orn. Reforms this year have led the government to take back some land concessions and reduce the terms on others, although some activists question whether these reforms have any teeth.

Water is also being withdrawn all along the Mekong to irrigate crops—

rubber and sugar in northeast Thailand, rice in Tonle Sap’s floodplain in Cambodia, and rice in Vietnam, which needs more and more water to keep saltwater intrusion from sea level rise at bay, said Mahood.

DAMMED IF THEY DO

With Asian countries developing rapidly, energy demand is increasing, and countries along the Mekong are building or planning dozens of hydroelectric projects—12 dams for the main stem of the river and 78 on its tributaries.

Dams are problematic on the Mekong. That’s because 189 species of fish migrate through the river. They complete their life cycles in rhythm with the seasonal flood pulses, which dams weaken, according to a paper published this year in the journal Science by 40 aquatic biologists, including Baran. Migratory fish in the Mekong supply 800,000 tons of food a year, said Baran—90 times the freshwater fish yield of the United States.

Putting so many dams in a single river system has cumulative effects, wrote the scientists. They advocate for new analytical methods that can weigh these impacts and allow decision makers to optimize both hydropower and the natural ecosystem that supplies fish and sediment to fertilize cropland. The method can identify the proposed dams that might not produce much energy but would have an outsize impact on fish movement and biodiversity.

Because it seems likely that many of the dams will be built, another group of scientists recently teamed up with engineers to try to make the dams less harmful to fish. Typically, engineers site and plan a dam and bring in aquatic ecologists at the end to try to mitigate environmental impacts in some small way. This team, though, came up with an obvious solution that had never been tried: Bring in the scientists first so the engineers can mitigate impacts throughout the planning process.

These innovations offer hope. But so far governments across the region are not acting on them, Baran said.

FOR THE BIRDS

Against this depressing backdrop, our guide Kunthea told us how local conservationists have helped secure the remarkable recovery of the white-shouldered ibis, the red-headed vulture, the slender-billed vulture, and the white-rumped vulture. We’d reached the edge of open water on Tonle Sap, and our little boat plied a narrow path through water hyacinths and freshwater mangroves standing waist-high in the water. A blue-tailed bee-eater darted by, landing on a water-borne shrub, so we could admire its aqua-blue, green, and gold plumage. Farther away, a painted stork rustled in a tree and a black-shouldered kite gave us a sharp eye. The Royal Government of Cambodia and the Secretariat of the Ramsar Convention designated this area, called the Prek Toal Core Bird Reserve, as a Wetland of International Importance (also known as a Ramsar Site) in December of last year, recognizing its environmental, social, and economic importance.

We pulled up to a dead end in front of a large endemic persimmon tree sporting two bamboo platforms. On the bottom one, close to the water, a couple of park rangers rested on mats, smoking cigarettes. We climbed a stick ladder fastened to the tree and emerged above the treetops onto the second platform. Kunthea brought a scope and showed us the flock of open-billed storks nesting in trees a short distance away.

That we could see such congregations of water birds was thanks largely to Sam Veasna Center and its partners at the Wildlife Conservation Society. They’ve achieved that protection by making conservation economically viable for local people, hiring boat owners to ferry us and feed us lunch at a floating restaurant in the lake town of Prek Toal. They also hire former hunters as guides for most sites. “They know how to find the birds and other animals, and also they have a lot of knowledge about the species,” said Orn.

To ensure the entire community is on board with conservation, not just the people participating in tourism, conservationists pay $30 per tourist to a village development fund. To make the benefits of conservation more tangible, they’ve put a price on the live heads of key species. “If a villager sees a species we are trying to conserve, we pay them $5 for spotting it,” said Orn. Humans have harvested eggs in the past. “If you agree to guard that nest until the chick fledges successfully, every day we pay $5.”

These creative practices just earned the Sam Veasna Center a spot as a finalist in the 2016 World Responsible Tourism Awards at the World Travel Market in London.

Too soon our journey on this captivating water world was over, and our minivan sped past woven huts on stilts, yards studded with chickens, and then concrete industrial buildings and the tuk-tuks, comfortable hotels, and myriad restaurants and shops of Siem Reap. Whether Tonle Sap will survive the next couple of decades relatively intact is uncertain. But Orn is optimistic. “I’m quite a positive guy,” he said. Change is difficult to predict, but it can happen suddenly, he said. The old politicians are dying, and “Cambodian youth, they want to change.”",A Giant Lake That Sustains Millions of People Is in Danger,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiELHVHZGzpQEtDk7wlwzoBYwqFggEKg4IACoGCAowo_USMICqBDDAgAo?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.takepart.com/sites/default/files/Cambodia-lake-MAIN1.jpg,2016-09-26,"{'sent': 'SIEM REAP, Cambodia—', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Cambodia']}}","SIEM REAP, Cambodia—Before dawn we set out in a small wooden boat across the largest inland lake in Southeast Asia, Tonle Sap in Cambodia.

0,"Having fielded various indecent proposals for his north Queensland wildlife sanctuary over the years, Harry Kunz has now extended a very decent one of his own.

Kunz wants to give away his two-hectare sanctuary and house on the picturesque Atherton tablelands.

The only catch? That the next owners carry on caring for the more than 1,200 injured or orphaned native animals taken in by the sanctuary every year.

Kunz is casting a nationwide net for candidates after a fruitless five-year search for a successor at his Eagles Nest wildlife hospital.

Drug dealers have previously urged him to forget the need for philanthropic funding support, promising him $100,000 a year to allow a dope plantation on the remote property instead, he says.

Some who “think I’m a senile old idiot giving his house and property away” eye the house and not the animals, he says, figuring that having a dog or cat qualifies them to care for birds of prey and marsupials. Others see the size of his avian enclosures and propose turning the sanctuary into a zoo.

“I’ve had a few offers but I said no, I want this continuing as a wildlife hospital because that’s what I’ve tried to do for almost 30 years now,” Kunz says. “I don’t want to lose what I created and built up, every shred, with all my money.”

The hospital was inspired by Kunz’s early experiences on his arrival in Sydney in 1982 seeing injured native birds such as galahs and cockatoos put down by Australian vets.

“I got a shock because, where I come from in Austria, a sulphur-crested cockatoo was $3,000 in a pet shop. I didn’t know you could buy them here for $10,” he says.

“For me it was an exotic wonderful bird who had just a broken wing. What’s the big deal? Anybody can fix this.”

Eagles Nest boasts a 78% survival rate for rescued animals.

Kunz says he has taken in every species imaginable in north Queensland bar hairy-nosed wombats and crocodiles. Birds of prey, cassowaries, emus, koalas have all been cared for.

Patients are commonly hit by cars, attacked by domestic dogs or cats, or made sick by indiscriminately used pesticides or poisons.

Occasionally local children show up seeking care for orphaned joeys or wallabies as their fathers, who shot the animals’ parents, sit sheepishly in their utes, Kunz said.

He says the “biggest success I can have” in his local education efforts is to sway visitors away from recreational hunting.

“The worst thing I’ve discovered is that 98% of hunting is done because it’s ‘fun’,” he says. “Some people say, ‘Next year when it grows up I can shoot it’.

“On the weekend, parties of six or seven people will go to the pub then take their guns and drive out shooting everything – birds, possums, whatever moves, whatever they see.

“I’ve got eagles with gunshot wounds, falcon hawk, cockatoos, you name it.

“There is no bigger, stupider predator than humans.”

Animals that can’t be returned to the wild live on in the sanctuary.

Kunz says it would be best run by a small team of passionate animal lovers, ideally a couple or family.

The haven he has created, in a region of rainforests, hot springs and waterfalls, is regularly described by visitors as a “paradise”, he says.

“Flocks of rainbow lorikeets come down, you have breakfast with the animals, it’s a beautiful place.”

Prospective successors would be invited to train at the sanctuary with Kunz, “for as long as they need”, before he decides on the most suitable to continue his legacy.

He says he can teach everything, from where to obtain free truckloads of bananas or sweet potatoes from supportive farmers, to maintaining the private, government and corporate grants that keep the place running.

0,"A rare baby iguana that was discovered on the island of Malolo Levu in Fiji has been moved to a captive environment at Ahura Resorts in Fiji by San Diego Zoo scientists to protect the animal from predators. The Fijian Crested Iguana was found during a recent population survey of a remnant dry forest area. The baby iguana brings the total documented number to 31.

""We found a new baby the other night and have named him Savuti” said Kim Lovich, curator of reptile at San Diego Zoo Global. “To protect him from being predated by cats we have moved him into a captive environment until he is bigger when we plan to put him back into the forest.”

The Fijian Crested iguana was considered extinct on Malolo Island until 2010, and a number of surveys have been taken since then to document the species that continue to survive in the few acres of dry forest left.

“We are avid that the little bit of dry forest that we have on our lease is maintained and preserved “said Steve Anstey, Group General Manager, Ahura Resorts. “Dry forests are one of the most endangered eco systems on the planet and it is crucial that all efforts are made to protect the small areas that remain and help revegitate it.”

Ahura Resorts, working closely with researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey, Taronga Zoo in Australia and the San Diego Zoo, have identified the major threats affecting the iguana population, including controlling the feral cat and rat population and keeping some iguanas in a protected breeding facility as the resorts.

Considered one of the world’s 25 most endangered Primates, yellow-tailed woolly monkeys are among the rarest monkeys on earth. As their habitat began to slowly disappear in the forests of South and Central America, their number dropped dramatically and the creatures are now threatened with extinction.

But as one of the Israeli researchers recently wrote, “saving these monkeys would make us more human.” And that’s exactly why TiME, an Israeli-founded organization, is raising money – to preserve their habitat in Peru.

In recent years, the only place where the population of yellow-tailed woolly monkeys increased has been El Toro, in the Amazonas region of Peru. There, their population increased by 30 percent, thanks to the intensive efforts of wildlife experts with the Neotropical Primate Conservation (NPC).

But the El Toro habitat is located on privately owned lands, and pressure is mounting to replace these forests with commercial farms. To avoid this, Israel’s “TiME” (This is My Earth) launched a crowd-funding campaign, allowing donors from all over the world to purchase these lands and protect the monkeys.

“In order to ensure a safe future for this species, it is absolutely critical to create a reserve for the yellow-tailed woolly monkeys, to ensure their survival,” TiME said in a statement.

So far, the crowd-funding campaign – run through Indiegogo’s “generosity” platform – has raised $14,000 of $25,000, with one more week to go. This initial amount would be enough to purchase about 70 hectares of land, and a total of $100,000 could help the group buy more land in the area (donations are also accepted on TiME’s website).

“By saving monkeys, our species shows that we humans can do better”

Founded last year by Israelis Prof. Alon Tal of Tel Aviv University and Dr. Uri Shanas of Haifa University, TiME is a nonprofit organization comprised of environmentalists and scientists from various countries, working together to halt the sharp decline in global biodiversity.

Environmental activist Tal is also the founder of Israel’s Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, and the co-founder of EcoPeace, among other organizations.

The Peruvian monkey is just one campaign TiME is currently running, with additional campaigns focusing on wildlife in Belize and Kenya. Donors vote on which project they’d like to focus on every year, and the Peruvian monkey was voted the most important for the coming year.

“Humans increasingly realize how much of our DNA we share with the animals on this planet,” Tal recently wrote in a Huffington Post column. “We also must learn to share critical places, like the El Toro forest in Peru, with the only other creatures with which we share creation… By saving monkeys and their home, our species shows that we humans can do better.”

0,"I heard them long before I could see them. Vocal and gregarious, a kaleidoscope of color bursting from exceedingly high trees. Unlike a songbird’s pleasing melody, a parrot’s squawk is at times irritating. Along a deserted road in the Colombian Amazon, near the town of Puerto Inírida in the department of Vaupés, I manage to watch some 100 macaws devour seeds, flirt, and play tag. They swoop low from branch to branch. To my advantage, the trees have few leaves and offer an amazing view, a rare experience during my bird-watching time in this country. Parrots are masters at camouflage. Their striking shades of green match their preferred environment. Seed and nut eaters, they spend the majority of time in trees, and on more than one occasion, I have watched a large number of them fly directly into a canopy and simply disappear.

Even parrots, with bright red or yellow markings, are difficult to see when they land on treetops and mingle with dead leaves or red berries that provide a backdrop of different colors. Parrots are also highly impatient and seem to never remain still. Colombia is home to 54 species of parrots that include macaws, parakeets, and parrotlets. Contrary to popular belief that parrots reside solely in the Amazonian rainforests, these incredible birds are found in regions across Colombia and even large cities. They thrive on the coast and forest lowlands, and their habitats are diverse — they are found anywhere from sea level in the jungle to as high as 3,000 metres in the Andes. Five parrots are endemic to Colombia, and another two species are being investigated to confirm whether they are native. A geographic location near the Equator ensures ideal weather and provides reliable, year-round supply of food for our green-feathered friends. With a preference to nest in vacant tree holes and hide from predators, birds have developed a close relationship with the forest. So Colombia’s biodiversity and vast swaths of forest provide a perfect habitat. But habitats are under siege from oil and gas exploration, illegal gold mining, logging, and industrial agricultural expansion.

Several of this country’s finest and rarest species are now threatened with extinction.This blight has caught the attention of international conservation organizations that partner with the ProAves foundation, a Colombian nonprofit headquartered in Bogotá. The primary aim of Fundación ProAves is to protect endangered birds and their habitats across Colombia. With public donations funding a full-time staff, the conservation programs have resulted in the creation of the largest private reserve system in Colombia, protecting 68% of all threatened birds, including a parrot corridor located in the Central Cordillera of the Andes that covers 7,500 hectares. This continuous string of reserves protects four endangered parrot species plus the habitat for various plants, endangered frogs, spectacled bears, and mountain tapirs. One of these reserves, El Mirador in the Quindió department, seeks to protect the Indigo-winged parrot (Hapalopsittaca fuertesi).

Vocal and gregarious, a kaleidoscope of color bursting from exceedingly high trees. Unlike a songbird’s pleasing melody, a parrot’s squawk is at times irritating. Along a deserted road in the Colombian Amazon, near the town of Puerto Inírida in the department of Vaupés, I manage to watch some 100 macaws devour seeds, flirt, and play tag. They swoop low from branch to branch. To my advantage, the trees have few leaves and offer an amazing view, a rare experience during my bird-watching time in this country. Parrots are masters at camouflage. Their striking shades of green match their preferred environment. Seed and nut eaters, they spend the majority of time in trees, and on more than one occasion, I have watched a large number of them fly directly into a canopy and simply disappear.

Even parrots, with bright red or yellow markings, are difficult to see when they land on treetops and mingle with dead leaves or red berries that provide a backdrop of different colors. Parrots are also highly impatient and seem to never remain still. Colombia is home to 54 species of parrots that include macaws, parakeets, and parrotlets. Contrary to popular belief that parrots reside solely in the Amazonian rainforests, these incredible birds are found in regions across Colombia and even large cities. They thrive on the coast and forest lowlands, and their habitats are diverse — they are found anywhere from sea level in the jungle to as high as 3,000 metres in the Andes. Five parrots are endemic to Colombia, and another two species are being investigated to confirm whether they are native. A geographic location near the Equator ensures ideal weather and provides reliable, year-round supply of food for our green-feathered friends. With a preference to nest in vacant tree holes and hide from predators, birds have developed a close relationship with the forest. So Colombia’s biodiversity and vast swaths of forest provide a perfect habitat. But habitats are under siege from oil and gas exploration, illegal gold mining, logging, and industrial agricultural expansion.

Several of this country’s finest and rarest species are now threatened with extinction.This blight has caught the attention of international conservation organizations that partner with the ProAves foundation, a Colombian nonprofit headquartered in Bogotá. The primary aim of Fundación ProAves is to protect endangered birds and their habitats across Colombia. With public donations funding a full-time staff, the conservation programs have resulted in the creation of the largest private reserve system in Colombia, protecting 68% of all threatened birds, including a parrot corridor located in the Central Cordillera of the Andes that covers 7,500 hectares. This continuous string of reserves protects four endangered parrot species plus the habitat for various plants, endangered frogs, spectacled bears, and mountain tapirs. One of these reserves, El Mirador in the Quindió department, seeks to protect the Indigo-winged parrot (Hapalopsittaca fuertesi). Since it is one of the rarest birds on the planet — spotted only in Colombia — and does not migrate, it depends on the regional mistletoe berry. With no known sightings for almost a century after its only Andean habitat was logged and cut down in 1911, the Indigo-winged parrot was once thought extinct.

0,"There are many ‘bird islands’ in Indonesia that one should not be surprised to hear about multiple islands named exactly the same – ‘Pulau Burung’ (bird island) – in the archipelago. These tiny islands (each of which could be navigated on foot in a matter of an hour or two) are wetlands thickly populated by mangroves. Their jungle-meets-the-ocean location makes them romantic, and trekking on these islands is a wonderful experience. Some of these islands are located very close to the capital city, among Pulau Seribu (The Thousand Islands) chain that is accessible by boat from the Jakarta harbour in one or two hours.

I have been visiting one such island in the past three months: Pulau Dua or Dua Island. Before I tell you anything about the place, let me inform you that Pulau Dua is technically not an island but a mango-shaped piece of land jutting out into the Java Sea on the northwestern coast of Java. Its geographical structure is peninsular in nature, and the wetlands lie a bit secluded from the rest of the village called Kasemen in the Banten Province. These probably give Pulau Dua the dubious island status.

How to Get There

It takes two to two and half hours from Jakarta to get to Pulau Dua. Get into the Jakarta-Merak highway from the city and keep driving for about one and a half to two hours. Exit Serang Timur (East Serang) and keep driving straight in the town. Look for the signboard directing to the right toward Sawah Luhur at a traffic signal. Keep driving for about 20-30 minutes and you end up at a concretised road. Take a sharp left turn and drive for about 300 metres until you see a house sandwiched by two stationery shops.

Park your car near the shop. Cross the road and start your 4km walk to the wetlands along the narrow alleys. On your way you can see fish ponds, rice paddies and a number of storks welcoming you to the aviary.

If you feel this walk is a bit tiring, you may want to get into the stationery shop and get some drinks. Chances are likely you may meet someone willing to take you there on ojek (motorcycle taxi service). Alternatively, you may also ask the shopkeeper for some assistance. These villagers are very well behaved and are not yet driven by lure of money as the guides in popular tourist destinations.

My guide at this place is a man named Humaiti who was shy enough not to openly talk about his rate per day and motorcycle hire charge. You may contact him at +6285966618880. I normally give him US$10-12 for three hours.

Getting Into the Wetlands

The aviary is fenced though there is no proper gate to prevent people from entering it without permission. At the entrance is the tourist office whose caretaker often gets very late for work. Humaiti knows him well and calls him to seek his permission to enter the jungle though this doesn’t seem to be an indispensable formality.

Some parts of the jungle are spacious enough for a smooth walk, while the rest are dense and will need the help of a stick to avoid thorny shrubs and branches. You may also need to overcome wet parts dotted with tiny coral rocks. During my second visit, this part proved to be even more challenging as an overnight rain had razed a huge tree to the ground. Humaiti and I hurdled over the bark of the fallen tree, at the same time stepping our feet on rocks to avoid immersing them into the wetland.

Thick canopies all above you mean that it’s not going to be an easy job spotting the species. But then a never-ending medley of chirpings and songs give a clear-cut idea of the presence of hundreds of species that you have already read about. These sounds were my best inspiration for trekking far into the jungle and seeking possible vantage points to spot the birds stealthily.

There it is, shush shush from Humaiti and a measured turning of the head to the left. A hermit heron perched atop a twig. Its fiery red eyes are an instant arrest of your attention. The grey head and plumes and the pink-hued lanky legs speak for themselves, it’s the Black Crowned Night Heron. That was the first realisation of my research that I had done prior to the visit. A few shots when the heron obliged and posed for me before taking to wings and disappear. I saw a few more but they were quite far and partially hidden by the foliage.

We moved on, brushing aside leaning twigs and leaves on our way. Occasionally spotting the blue sea to our right through the gaps between the trees, there’s a bit of cackle up above. I raised my head and spotted the silhouette of a darter against a sky that was still lighting up. It wasn’t easy to focus on the bird as my vision was through a small gap between the foliage. Slowly I became adept in this kind of wildlife photography: to search for birds between the gaps and focus on them in the best way possible. Holding a Canon 5 D with a Sigma 150-500 mm mounted on it is a heavy task, and to get a clear focus without a tripod is even more taxing.

During my second visit very recently, I was able to get dramatic silhouettes of darters before the sun rose up completely. I cherished that moment, not just getting the shot but also the silence around me and Humaiti. The early morning air was a great thrill.

We trekked further, coming across some Muslim tombs hidden among the vegetation. Humaiti explained to me that the area was used as a cemetery before the government made it a protected place. We also came across ruins of a building. Even Humaiti doesn’t have any clue to it. Though not really part of my visit these things provided some sort of additional perks to the trekking experience.

We finally came to the vantage spot Humaiti was talking about. It was an open space from where you get unobstructed views of some trees situated in a pond and the swamp around it. Goodness me!

There were a dozen species or more than that as tiny birds may not be spotted easily.

I loved to watch the Milky Stork family sitting very united, so were the darters and some Great White egrets. I saw grey-coloured birds behind the Milky Storks that appeared to be Grey Egrets, but I was not sure. I couldn’t get a clear shot of them. The herons were here and there. Teals shared space with the bigger birds. All of a sudden, all the birds took to the skies, apparently caused by some commotion that neither Humaiti nor I could figure out. After crisscrossing the sky, they once again settled down on those same branches where they were perching. I took the opportunity to capture their commotion, still clueless what made them flutter their wings abruptly.

I remembered a saying – when there is danger in the jungle every animal comes to know about it quickly, but not a single human being does so.

I spent one full hour at this spot before moving on toward the seaside. Humaiti pointed out swampy lands where the sun never reaches. He told me how the place often gets flooded during rainy season. The partial views of the sea were one of the most admirable during these treks. We reached the beach, took a look at the fishermen and their boats in the distance and had views of the nearby islands, Pulau Panjang in particular, another bird island.

Finally, we trekked back. Surprisingly, I was able to meet with the heron and the darter, which I had spotted soon after my entrance, perched on the same place.

Now a new Israeli-led conservationist project will ensure this rare primate species will have a protected land area in the Peruvian Andes, safe from deforestation and poaching.

This Is My Earth (TiME) – an Israeli-founded non-profit organization based in New York– recently crowdfunded $30,000 to purchase privately-owned land in the Peruvian Andes to create a nature reserve for over 300 species.

“Within less than a year, we’ve managed to show that it’s possible to save species and protect the earth through crowdsourcing, thanks to lots of caring people,” said TiME co-founder Prof. Uri Shanas of the Biology and Environment Department at the University of Haifa’s Oranim Campus.

TiME’s members include environmental leaders and renowned scientists from around the world.

The crowdsourced project will see TiME purchase the nature reserve habitat in the Peruvian Andes, currently privately-owned land.

This habitat is home to over 300 species of birds, lizards, and mammals, among them many of which appear on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Among the vulnerable species found at the site include the Peruvian night monkey, the spectacled bear, the long-whiskered owlet, the white-bellied spider monkey, the Royal sunangel and jaguars.

“According to Peruvian law, the land can only be sold to locals (members of the Yambrasbamba Campesino community). Accordingly, the land will be purchased in the community’s name by a local conservation organization, Neotropical Primate Conservation, managed by Sam and Noga Shanee. The Shanees have lived in the area for years, working to help save species in danger of extinction. They will manage the site together with the local community, and in the spirit of TiME, research and educational activities will be integrated in the purchased area,” said Alon Tal, veteran environmental activist in Israel and a co-founder of TiME.

“The rate of deforestation in the rainforest is among the highest in the world,” said Shanas. “This specific site serves as an important corridor between two existing reserves. Breaking the chain of forests in this area could dissect the region, leaving small animal populations unable to survive. Although this is a small area of land, we have been motivated by this success. We really hope that this proof of concept will help us recruit more supporters and members over the coming year.”",Conservationists buy land in Peru to save endangered species,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlzcmFlbDIxYy5vcmcvY29uc2VydmF0aW9uaXN0cy1idXktbGFuZC1pbi1wZXJ1LXRvLXNhdmUtZW5kYW5nZXJlZC1zcGVjaWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.israel21c.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Yellow-Tail2.jpg,2017-01-31,"{'sent': '’s top 25 most endangered primates.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['25']}}","The world’s yellow-tailed woolly monkey population is critically endangered and repeatedly features on a list of the world’s top 25 most endangered primates.

During his years as a doctor at the Dutch trading post in Nagasaki, Siebold built up a huge collection of Japanese animals, plants, artworks, and maps. These allowed him to write some of the most influential early modern works on Japan—and led to his deportation from Japan on suspicion of spying.

The Many Faces of the Doctor

Philipp Franz von Siebold (1796–1866) arrived in Japan in 1823, where he was assigned to work as a physician at the Dutch trading mission on the small island of Dejima in Nagasaki. Then just 27 years old, Siebold was to spend almost six years in Japan. During that time, he introduced the latest European medical discoveries to numerous Japanese students of rangaku (“Dutch” learning) at Narutaki-juku, the small school he established next to his surgery, and immersed himself in a study of Japanese botany. He also carried out market surveys with a view to boosting trade between Japan and the Netherlands, and had special instructions from the Dutch government to collect political and military intelligence on Japan. Beneath the public face of the doctor and natural scientist, there was much more to Siebold than most people realized.

Siebold was born into the German aristocracy, and chose to follow a medical career from an early age. He opened a medical practice after graduating from Würzburg University, but soon left the political and economic stagnation of his homeland behind in search of better opportunities elsewhere. At the time, the Dutch government was looking for a doctor to work in its trading enclave and was also eager to gather intelligence in Japan, where the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted to trade by the shōgun’s government. It wanted someone who could find out more about everything from plants to daily life, culture, the state of the nation and its borders, and military affairs. Siebold, from the Kingdom of Bavaria in the German Confederation, was the ideal candidate.

The Strange-Talking Hollander of the Mountains

As a Bavarian, Siebold had grown up speaking a variety of German quite different from the Low Germanic dialects spoken across northern Germany and the Netherlands, and it was some time before he felt comfortable speaking Dutch. When he arrived in Japan, the Japanese interpreter who interviewed him was suspicious of his impenetrable way of speaking and interrogated him closely on where he was from. Only Dutchmen were allowed to enter Japan at the time. It was left to the Dutch opperhoofd (chief factor) to save the day by explaining that the new arrival was “one of the mountain Hollanders (yama Orandajin), and speaks a strange dialect.” This inspired act of quick thinking was enough to get Siebold safely past the shōgun’s border guards.

In 1824, Siebold received permission from the shōgun’s representatives in Nagasaki and became the first foreigner to set up a small private teaching academy (juku) in Japan. It was located in a villa on land belonging to a Japanese interpreter in Narutaki on the outskirts of Nagasaki. The name of the new academy soon became well known among Japan’s scholars of Dutch learning. Doctors and others eager to find out about the latest developments in Western medicine flocked to Nagasaki to learn from Siebold. Narutaki-juku was a two-story wooden building with a garden planted with medicinal herbs and other plants gathered by Siebold and his students from all over Japan.

Siebold assigned each of his students to study a particular area in each field and had them submit reports to him in Dutch. Mima Junzō compiled a treatise on childbirth, based on the work of earlier Japanese writers. Totsuka Seikai and Ishii Sōken submitted a translation of a four-part Japanese treatise on the ancient East Asian use of moxibustion as a medical treatment. Many of the Japanese who studied at Siebold’s juku became pioneers of Western modern medicine and biology in Japan.

Gathering Intelligence

Siebold’s students came from all over Japan. Through his interactions with them, Siebold was able to gather a huge amount of information about the country. As well as being a base for his teaching, Naruyaki-juku was also the headquarters of Siebold’s efforts to collect as much intelligence as he could about Japan.

Siebold never accepted charges for his medical services. His patients often left artworks or handicrafts out of gratitude. The Dutch king had apparently promised Siebold an allowance of 12,000 guilders (around ¥250 million in today’s money) to build up a collection of Japanese artworks. Among his many other responsibilities, he was also an art collector who bought directly for the royal household.

Spying in Edo?

At regular intervals, the head of the Dutch trading mission in Nagasaki traveled to visit the shōgun at his castle in Edo (modern Tokyo). After traveling in procession from distant Nagasaki, the Dutch traders would pay obeisance to the shōgun, presenting gifts and swearing loyalty. This official procession to Edo presented Siebold with a rare opportunity to find out more about the shōgun’s capital, and one he was determined not to miss. At the time, foreigners were strictly forbidden from roaming about the country, and the Dutch were rarely allowed outside the confines of their small trading post. In 1826, Siebold took part in the procession led by Johan Willem de Sturler, the opperhoofd at the time. Along with a team of Japanese interpreters, Siebold took several of his juku students as his personal assistants. The artist Kawahara Keiga was also in the entourage, and was responsible for keeping a pictorial record of the scenery and customs they encountered on their long journey.

The Dutch mission always stayed at the Nagasakiya in Nihonbashi, a unique inn that catered specifically for envoys from the Dutch mission. Siebold met numerous people during his stay at the inn. Particularly significant was his meeting with the well-connected and well-informed Mogami Tokunai. Mogami was an explorer who had helped to map what is now Hokkaidō and some of the surrounding islands during the late eighteenth century. More recently, his protégé Mamiya Rinzō had undertaken major surveying expeditions in Sakhalin and the surrounding area. Siebold begged Mogami for his maps of Ezo (modern Hokkaidō) and Karafuto (Sakhalin). Like many people at the time, he wanted to know for sure whether Sakhalin was an island or was connected to the Asian landmass. Japanese law strictly forbade allowing maps of Japan to pass into foreign hands, so Mogami was careful to whisper his reply: “I can’t give you the maps. But I can lend them to you for a while. But you must promise not to tell anyone else . . .”

Many people visited the inn specifically to meet Siebold. One of them was Takahashi Kageyasu, the shōgun’s senior official in charge of documents, who visited Nagasakiya on numerous occasions. The maps of Japan drawn by Inō Tadataka and others still showed gaps along the northern coastlines that Takahashi wanted to check against Siebold’s copy of A Voyage Around the World by Krusenstern, who had led the first Russian circumnavigation of the world. Takahashi offered to give Siebold a copy of one of the latest maps of Japan in return for Krusenstern’s book. The map was a chart that showed the Japanese coastline all the way to Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands.

Besides his collecting and teaching activities, Siebold also found time to put down personal roots in Japan. He became intimate with a local courtesan Taki, known professionally as Sono Ōgi and the two had a daughter together called Ine. The girl grew up to become famous as the first female doctor to practice Western medicine in Japan.

The Siebold Incident and Deportation

In 1828, a major scandal broke out that led to Siebold’s being expelled from the country. A Dutch trading ship about to leave Nagasaki for the Dutch East Indies was swamped by storms and ran aground. During the attempt to rescue the foundering vessel, Japanese officials discovered many of Siebold’s most treasured secrets already stowed on board, including maps of Japan, plans of Edo Castle, and surveys of Sakhalin. Most of these items were things Siebold had collected by various means during his trip to Edo. Taking any of them out of the country was strictly forbidden. The detailed map of Sakhalin that he had received from Takahashi was a particular problem.

Official suspicion soon fell on Takahashi himself. Takahashi had known that the government would regard copying the map and giving it to Siebold as a serious crime, but he was convinced that his deal with Siebold was in the country’s best interests. For Takahashi, it was a crime of conviction. Takahashi was arrested and admitted that he had given the forbidden items to Siebold. Siebold himself insisted that he was interested in the maps only as part of his studies of Japan’s fauna and flora, and denied that he was a spy. Takahashi was reprimanded and Siebold’s collection confiscated. After interrogation, Siebold was banished from the country.

Perry and Siebold: Two Differing Approaches

Siebold returned to the Netherlands in 1830 and took up residence in Leiden. Drawing on the huge collection of materials he had brought back, he published the colossal study Nippon in 1832, in addition to a study of the flowers and of Japan. This second book, Flora Japonica, records that Siebold, who loved hydrangea, gave the scientific name H. otaksa to a species of the flower that bloomed near Narutaki-juku after his wife. A subsequent work on the fauna of Japan introduced people in Europe to the Japanese giant salamander.

Not long after Siebold’s hurried departure, Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in Uraga in 1853 bearing a letter from US President Millard Fillmore. Although Siebold’s intelligence on Japan was highly useful to Perry, the American was suspicious of the Dutch presence in Japan. He refused all offers of Dutch assistance and was adamant that the United States would open Japan to trade in its own way.

Kobayashi Jun’ichi, deputy head of the Edo-Tokyo Museum and one of the organizers of the exhibition Revisiting Siebold, says the two men had very different approaches to opening: “Perry knew Siebold, but he chose not to follow his approach and decided to open Japan to international trade as quickly as possible, backed by the threat of military force. As a result, the bakufu [shogunate] collapsed and Japan’s isolation policy came to an end. Although their ultimate aims may have been the same, Siebold wanted to open the country gradually through an increase in trade.”

Although Siebold may have lost out to Perry in terms of opening Japan to international trade, in an academic sense his contribution to Japanese studies in the West had much greater significance. His writings and private collection were responsible for introducing many European people to Japan for the first time, including at the Paris Expo in 1900. For many years, his collection of Japanese objects and curiosities was open to the public from his house in Leiden, paving the way for the japonisme movement that swept through Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One hundred and fifty years after his death, Siebold continues to be an important figure—particularly in Japan. His contributions to Japanese studies in Europe and Western learning in Japan deserve to be remembered and celebrated.

0,"Rare and endangered northern bettongs have been found in far north Queensland in an area where it was believed the animal had died out, environmental group WWF says.

The northern bettong is one of northern Australia's rarest marsupials and its numbers have dramatically dropped in recent decades.

For more than 10 years, the only place they were known to exist was Lamb Range, south-west of Cairns.

WWF northern bettong project coordinator Jess Koleck said three bettongs had been photographed by a sensor camera in Mount Lewis National Park near Port Douglas, north of Cairns, in an area about 75 kilometres north-west of Lamb Range.

The bettongs were detected in a two-square-kilometre section of the national park.

""After searching for a year and a half, and walking for hundreds of kilometres in rugged bush, this was our eureka moment,"" Ms Koleck said.

""It means we don't have all our eggs in one basket. If a major fire or disease outbreak greatly reduced the Lamb Range population, there are at least some survivors to the north.""

The newly discovered population is thought to be small, but WWF believes more work needs to be done to accurately determine its size.

It is collaborating with James Cook University and the Queensland Government on the project, establishing more than 100 cameras in the wild to search for the creatures, which have an average body length of just over 30 centimetres and weigh only around 1 kilogram.

The five-year monitoring program also involves cage trapping bettongs to estimate the size of their population.

Cameras have been placed about a kilometre apart in rows with baits containing peanut butter, oats, vanilla and truffle oil placed nearby, as truffles make up a large part of the animal's diet.

""Looking through a mountain of images has been a slow and tedious process, but we were all celebrating when there on the screen were northern bettongs from three different camera points,"" Ms Koleck said.

Aussie wildlife guerrilla soldier Steve Irwin would have turned 55 today and we miss him like anything.

Robbie Williams ‘gives up Brits dressing room’ to The 1975’s 100-piece choir

The man who David Attenborough called ‘a born communicator’ — and who was called a ‘modern-day Noah’ by the CEO of RSPCA Queensland — died in 2006 after being stabbed by a stingray.

It came as a sad blow to the dual worlds of wildlife conservation and TV entertainment, but his spirit lives on in his enthusiastic children Bindi, 18, and Robert, 16, who are carrying on his animal-championing legacy.

While we can’t bake him a cake shaped like a crocodile (his favourite animal), we can celebrate his passion and sense of fun, so here are some the greatest things he ever came out with…

1. ‘Crocodiles are easy. They try to kill and eat you. People are harder. Sometimes they pretend to be your friend first.’

2. ‘When I talk to the camera, mate, it’s not like I’m talking to the camera, I’m talking to you because I want to whip you around and plunk you right there with me.’

3. ‘The only animals I’m not comfortable with are parrots, but I’m learning as I go. I’m getting better and better at ’em. I really am.’

4. ‘Inside the house was just snakesville. Crikey, mate, it was chockablock full of snakes.’ On his childhood home, populated by animals

Steve loved animals more than anyone could reasonably expect (Picture: Australia Zoo via Getty Images)

5. ‘I have no fear of losing my life. If I have to save a koala or a crocodile or a kangaroo or a snake, mate, I will save it.’

6. ‘Yeah, I’m a thrill seeker, but crikey, education’s the most important thing.’

7. ‘They’re not short! They’re normal shorts. I could get the short shorts out of the closet.’ On his shorts

8. ‘Her karma helps my karma. Together, we’re not stressed. We’re pretty passive, pretty laid-back.’ On his rhinoceros iguana, Rebecca

9. ‘[Bindi] had a front tooth hanging off with a bit of meat and blood there and she said “Daddy can you get this off?”. So I got the long-nosed pliers and went in there.’

10. ‘There are 23 species of crocodile. Seventeen of those species are rare or endangered. They’re on the way out, no matter what anyone does or says, you know.’

11. ‘We don’t own the planet Earth, we belong to it. And we must share it with our wildlife.’

13. ‘I think it’s a heck of a lot safer than a kid watching or playing a video game where you’re killing all the time.’ On the influence of his TV shows on children

14. ‘Oh, mate! Honestly, I loved that. You know, I’m Australian, and we have got the worst sense of humor. We are cruel to each other. South Park was excellent, really.’ On the episode of South Park which took the Mickey out of him

We’re sure Steve’s son Robert will come out with loads more bits of genius himself as he follows in his father’s very bouncy footsteps.

“The way we’re exploring this is not much different from how Humboldt or Wallace or Darwin got to these places 200 years ago,” José Padial explained one morning last February, as gauzy light slanted into a forest clearing deep in Peru’s remote Vilcabamba Range. His team had just slashed through a mile of steep jungle with machetes, collecting dozens of specimens—from iridescent lizards to unremarkable brown frogs—many of which appeared to be new to science. Padial had almost trampled on a bushmaster, one of the hemisphere’s most dangerous snakes, and now heard rumors that some members of the local Asháninka community were plotting to block him from leaving their territory with specimens he had government permission to collect. Camped just below 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) in a damp patch of cloud forest, the herpetologist was two weeks into his expedition but still several days from his goal—the isolated grasslands atop one of South America’s least explored mountain ranges. His most reliable source of navigating the team’s route there were some low-resolution images he’d printed from Google Earth.

Not that any trail map—or trail—existed. Few humans had ever set foot on the upper reaches of the Vilcabamba Range, a northeastern spur of the Andes that juts like an archipelago into the sea of Amazon jungle. And fewer still in the half-century since two wealthy New Yorkers, Brooks Baekeland and Peter Gimbel, became the first to do so, dropping by parachute onto a 10,500-foot-high grassy plateau in 1963. Lured by stories of Incan gold, ruins, “Indian taboos” and “sacrificial lakes in the sky,” the explorers instead encountered a primeval landscape of soggy Sphagnum bog, hilly prairie, and stands of pygmy bamboo. With two companions, they spent more than two months bushwhacking down to the Amazon basin, surviving blinding wasp stings and spooked natives with bows drawn. National Geographic’s title of the account suggested a fairytale: “By Parachute into Peru’s Lost World.” Baekeland, the grandson of the inventor of Bakelite plastic, would later recall the pioneering trek “as though in a nightmare.”

“Part of me wonders if we should have parachuted into the upper part of Vilcabamba,” Padial wrote on the expedition’s Tumblr blog before leaving Pittsburgh, where the 39-year-old Spaniard serves as the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s assistant curator of amphibians and reptiles. He knew that reaching the highlands by foot—during the height of the rainy season—would be a slog. He’d tried before, in 2008, but never made it above 1,800 meters (6,000 feet). Improvising a route through steep, tangled jungle and schlepping tents, tarps, cooking pots, camera gear, solar panels, and food for at least a dozen people between successive base camps required ample trailblazers and porters. Padial expected to have little trouble finding local Asháninka willing to work, and offered more than twice the going wage. Still, he struggled to recruit just six of them. The cold, lofty terrain, the time away from families—most able-bodied workers simply didn’t care for the job description. One porter bruised his knee after a week and went home. Another, a 14-year-old named “John Clever,” shot a kinkajou, a raccoon-like creature one night, and after gutting and smoking the animal until morning, descended with it and never returned.

Scientific exploration in the remotest parts of the world is impossible to script. Every one of Padial’s expeditions has involved some unanticipated mishap, some checked ambition. The previous year, while exploring a rugged swath of Amazonian jungle along Peru’s border with Brazil, his team showed up at an Asháninka community with 20 days’ worth of gear and provisions, and permits from local officials granting access through the territory. The community welcomed them, offered shelter for one night, and then, refused to let them pass. Complications like this come with the territory, however, and for Padial and the other biologists are the cost of achieving the ultimate goal: finding something no human has ever seen. “We all have this draw of early explorers,” he told me. “We want to go to those places where no one has been before, and be the first to find these animals.”

There is scientific importance to such a quest, of course. Each discovery brings new perspective about the planet’s biological diversity, and helps us understand how much we are losing every time we decide to bulldoze or clear-cut an area. “At the least, we leave a record behind of what there was there at a time,” Padial says. Simply knowing what lives where also helps to fill gaps in the tree of life, the genealogical relationships among species. Every undiscovered organism out there, Padial explains, is a missing link in our understanding of evolution as a whole, as species are the entities that actually evolve.

“If you don’t discover these species and give them a name, they pass unnoticed. They don’t exist.”

The Vilcabamba is filled with unnamed species, Padial believes. Biologists have long suspected that its range of elevations and wide variety of habitat types harbor a tremendous diversity of animals and plants. The few scientific expeditions ever to have penetrated its vast, untrammeled wilderness encountered several new species in “unexpected habitats or in surprising abundance,” according to one account. Logging, natural gas and oil exploration, and agriculture now threaten to fracture this pristine picture, and Padial hopes that by shedding light on the region’s richness, this expedition—officially titled the Carnegie Discoverers Expedition to Vilcabamba—might begin to make the case for its protection.

The team members play cards by the light of their headlamps. Andy Isaacson

In camp, Padial poured himself a cup of rainwater-brewed coffee, and then gathered his team around an improvised table made of sticks to devise a way forward. Smoke billowed from the cooking fire, nestled against the base of a tree trunk, over which moss-covered logs had been stacked to dry. Padial laid out his Google Earth printouts and a topographic map. The satellite images showed a birds-eye view of the densely forested ridgeline they’d been tracing, the same ridgeline that continued to rise sharply above them to 2,500 meters (8,000 feet), zigzagging for a couple miles, and then sloping gradually toward a hilly prairie at around 3,200 meters (10,500 feet).

It was impossible to tell how long it might take to get there, but they had ten days to try. The team—six biologists (Spanish and Peruvian), a cook (also a Peruvian biologist), and Padial’s girlfriend, a Mexican dancer and filmmaker—was used to the uncertainties and deprivations of expedition life, anyway. Most had joined Padial on previous amphibian and reptile surveys. They hadn’t showered for days, and wore damp underwear and socks. By past standards of luxury, the French-press coffee maker that Padial had secured this time represented something five-star. More importantly, they’d heard the Vilcabamba highlands concealed a herpetological Lost City of the Incas, an irresistible quarry: frogs, toads, lizards, and snakes found nowhere else on Earth.

Padial had been looking for lost places ten years earlier, when he first spotted the 110-mile long mountain range while flying around South America on Google Earth. A rocky massif fringed with green, the Vilcabamba called to mind the tabletop mountains, called tepuis—the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World—that loom above the Venezuelan jungle like islands in the sky and host species found nowhere else on Earth. “It looked high and isolated,” Padial recalls. “I thought, ‘Wow, it would be amazing to go there.’”

The Vilcabamba Range emerges out of the steamy Amazonian lowlands, at an elevation of around 450 meters (1,500 feet), and climbs to a jagged, central crest above 4,200 meters (14,000 feet). The local native groups—the Asháninka, Matsiguenga, Nomatsiguenga, and Yine—never settled the lofty interior, finding it too cold, wet, and lacking good soil and game. It remains largely virgin, free of roads, and enjoying token protection within the boundaries of Otishi National Park and two indigenous reserves. Cut off from the eastern slope of the Andes by the Apurimac and Ene rivers, a main source of the Amazon, and moated by deep valleys and gorges on all sides, its isolation has set the stage for a wide range of endemic flora and fauna to evolve. A frog living at 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) in the Vilcabamba cloud forest would have a long way to hop across several thousand vertical feet, through several foreign habitats, to reach familiar turf across the Apurimac. No chance. “The species that live in the upper area have probably been isolated from the rest of their relatives for a very long time,” Padial explained. Exactly how long these organisms have been isolated is one of the things he and the others aim to figure out.

The mountains are in a rich neighborhood already, ecologically speaking. The tropical Andes is considered one of the world’s 35 biodiversity “hotspots,” boasting the highest percentage of endemic plant and vertebrate species—creatures like the yellow-eared parrot (Ognorhynchus icterotis) and spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus). A recent survey of Manu National Park and its buffer zone, along the eastern slope of the Andes in southeastern Peru, counted 287 reptile and amphibian species (as well as more than 1,000 species of birds—around 10 percent of the world’s total) living there alone: the most diversity found in any protected area on the planet.

Lying 100 miles northwest of Manu as the parrot flies, the Vilcabamba Range, in contrast, remains terra incognita. Tough to access, no other area in the Andes of even remotely comparable size is still so poorly known to biologists. It has never been all that welcoming. Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, the Ene-Apurimac Valley was the heartland of the Shining Path, the Maoist guerrillas who terrorized Peru. Nowadays, the area is the world’s largest producer of coca, whose leaves are refined into paste at clandestine camps in the forest. Just south of Padial’s route, drug mules by the hundreds cross the Vilcabamba by foot, with medics and armed escorts. Encounters with traffickers can be tragic: Members of a Bolivian scientific team were slain in that country’s Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in 1986 after their aircraft inadvertently landed beside a clandestine coca-paste factory.

The few research efforts undertaken in the Vilcabamba Range over the years have managed to paint a picture of exceptional biodiversity. In the late 1960s, American ornithologists John Terborgh and John Weske mounted a series of landmark expeditions to study bird community structure along an altitudinal gradient from 600 to 3,520 meters (2,000 to 11,500 feet)—basically what Padial hoped to mimic for amphibians and reptiles. They recorded 405 species on the mountains’ western slopes alone. (It’s estimated that the Vilcabamba Range may contain more than half of all bird species known from Peru.) Then, in 1997, Conservation International and Smithsonian Institution surveys found many new species, including a pale grey tree rat the size of a domestic cat. Their report declared the area “a special place in relation to biodiversity.”

Padial’s first expedition there was sort of a misadventure. In 2008, he and his former Ph.D. advisor, Ignacio de la Riva, a biologist from Spain’s National Museum of Natural Sciences, led a team that attempted to reach the highlands by following a river upstream from Kimbiri, a tropical town along the Apurimac. Mapping a distance of five miles, Padial figured they could get there in two days of solid hiking. The terrain, however, proved far steeper, muddier and harder to penetrate than one could glean from a satellite image. After two weeks, exhausted and hungry, they turned back.

Padial knew better this time. He spent two years planning the expedition, securing funds from Carnegie Museum donors and permits from Peruvian government agencies. He’d negotiated delicately with the residents of Marontuari, the Asháninka community at the base of the ridge, gamely sipping their alcoholic homebrew of fermented yucca root from a hollowed gourd as they spoke about the threats to their territory from encroaching coca plantations and a planned hydroelectric dam, as well as their reservations about Padial himself. “They are very suspicious about what we do with the samples,” he says. “To them, it’s just weird, the whole idea of conservation—that someone goes and collects these animals that no one pays attention to. If you put money into something, [they figure] you’re going to get something.”

Rather than clamber upriver, his plan this time was to drive an hour into the Vilcabamba up a dirt road from Pichari, a sleepy town along the Apurimac, until it dead-ended in Marontuari. Bushwhacking from there to the highlands, his team would pitch successive base camps—where flat ground permitted—as the environment transitioned from lowland montane forest to cloud forest, elfin forest, and finally, the Puna grasslands, a treeless region found across the central Andes between 3,200 and 4,000 meters (10,500 and 13,000 feet).

When Baekeland’s team parachuted there in the 1960s, they glimpsed an Andean spectacled bear and a Peruvian puma, but little else. Three decades later, the biologists working with Conservation International—landing by helicopter—spotted guinea pigs, numerous grass mice, and a large arboreal rodent (family Abrocomidae) that resembled one known only from bones excavated from pre-Columbian burial sites at Machu Picchu, farther south. They collected just four species of reptiles and amphibians—three frogs and one lizard—but all appeared new to science.

For Padial, the promise of scientific discovery is what had lured him to herpetology. As an undergraduate in Spain, studying biology, he volunteered on a couple of field expeditions in the Bolivian jungle and kept finding it a struggle to identify the amphibians and reptiles he observed. Even today, no general field guide yet exists for reptiles and amphibians of the Amazon. While some 7,500 species of amphibians have been identified worldwide, untold thousands remain at large. Since 1985, the total number of recognized species has increased by more than 60 percent—a new species of amphibian is described in the scientific literature every 2.5 days. Yet knowledge of their diversity and distribution pales in comparison to what scientists understand about birds and mammals. “It’s just amazing how much there is to do,” Padial says.

In the past decade, he’s launched several successful, globe-spanning expeditions, including three trips to Mauritania that resulted in the first species accounts of amphibians and reptiles for that country, as well as a pioneering excursion into Peru’s Alto Purús National Park, a wild, poorly known patch of Amazonian rainforest home to several uncontacted nomadic tribes, that yielded several new species.

Putting animals on the map of science can serve a conservation goal, too. The Vilcabamba Range stands as one of the last intact tropical montane forests left in South America, a species-rich belt that once ran the length of the eastern Andes, from northern Venezuela south to Bolivia. Yet along its lower flanks, the elevation holding the most biodiversity, the forest is being destroyed at an alarming rate to make way for coca and coffee plantations. Illegal logging also chips away. Much of the interior is within the bounds of two indigenous reserves and Otishi National Park, but the park’s staff, which includes eight rangers charged with policing 1,100 square miles (an area the size of United States’ Yosemite National Park), have few resources to combat encroachment, not to mention drug traffickers traipsing around with weapons. Perhaps by shedding a light on the unique and extraordinary life in the Vilcabamba, scientific efforts like Padial’s could help Otishi acquire the resources needed for more robust protection, like those afforded to Manu National Park. And maybe somewhere high in “Peru’s Lost World” there lives a charismatic, endemic species of frog yet to be discovered that could become an emblem for conservation.

Throughout the expedition, the scientists often encountered animals by happenstance—a lizard found skittering between campfire logs, a frog startled during a walk to pee. But since many amphibians are nocturnal, the best chance of finding them is to go probing after dark. One evening at Camp 2, as with most nights, Padial and the others strapped on headlamps and set out to collect. He wore rubber boots, square-rimmed glasses, and a collared shirt with pens tucked into the breast pocket. The group fanned out along with trail, walking slowly. They scanned leaves and tree trunks and poked at the wet leaf litter with sticks. Soon, Padial’s light reflected off the eyes of a small brown frog perched haplessly atop a leaf. He snatched the animal up, and holding it under the beam of his headlamp by its legs, gave it a quick taxonomic spot check.

Padial specializes in New World “direct developers” (Terrarana), a sprawling group of frog families ranging from Texas to northern Argentina. Instead of laying eggs in water that hatch into tadpoles, Terrarana frogs deposit their eggs in moist dirt, or moss, out of which emerge fully formed juveniles. Most of the frogs and toads in the Vilcabamba were of this type, as the steep slopes allow for few ponds or standing water.

Padial could tell immediately that the frog belonged to the genus Pristimantis, a large group of mostly terrestrial direct developers. But he was looking for traits that might help place the frog more precisely on the family tree. Did it have an exposed tympanum (ear drum)? Sticky toe pads? Was its belly transparent or pigmented, glandular or smooth? What kind of dot pattern colored the inner thigh for signaling the opposite sex? A few days earlier, Padial had collected a frog that at first glance resembled one he’d collected on a previous trip to the Amazon. But on closer inspection, he noticed its sharper snout and transparent peritoneum, the spider web like membrane covering the organs that on some frogs is pigmented. “Those are like the differences between a chimp and a human, like being fully covered by hair or not,” Padial explained. “I think it was a new species.”

He plopped the Pristimantis into a clear plastic bag along with some leaves to keep the frog moist. Searching for and catching animals was the fun part—Padial had been doing that since he was a kid, hunting snakes near his grandfather’s house on the outskirts of Granada, Spain. Later came the humdrum tasks: measuring frogs, counting scales, and analyzing anatomy, bone structure, mating calls, genes, distribution patterns and climate data. “You need music for that,” Padial confessed. The team’s forest lab amounted to a stick table covered by a rain poncho, surrounded by bags containing frogs, toads and lizards. Each specimen was first euthanized with a dose of Lidocaine, the numbing drug used by dentists, and tagged with a number. With tweezers, the researchers would then extract a tiny sample of thigh tissue for later genetic analysis, and finally inject formalin to fix the animal’s shape.

With data from his two Vilcabamba expeditions, combined with findings from the CI-Smithsonian surveys in the ’90s—the herpetological specimens collected then had yet to be fully analyzed—Padial hoped to assemble the best existing catalog of amphibians and reptiles in the Vilcabamba Range.

Although Padial and his team made important discoveries on the way up, in a sense this was all a means to an end. The ultimate goal was to survey the Vilcabamba’s upper reaches, a haven for endemic species. On the third week, an advance team that included Padial, a Asháninka father and son from Marontuari, and Angel Castellano, an Otishi park ranger, managed to hack a way through to 2,760 meters (9,055 feet). Their track wound past twisted branches carpeted with epiphytic mosses, and sprawling tree root systems that required vertical rock-climbing maneuvers. Passing over gaps in the vegetation where losing one’s footing could mean falling off a precipice, it made the well-maintained Pacific Crest Trail look like the Champs-Élysées by comparison.

Along the exposed ridge top, the cloud forest became a bushy elfin forest of tree ferns, bamboo, and reedy grasses. During breaks in the fog, creeping up from the valley, you could make out the jagged crest of the Vilcabamba Range, still some distance above. The change in scenery came with a host of new creatures; species like the cartoonishly bloated cane toad and electric blue poison-dart frog the team collected around Camp 1 were nowhere to be found. “It’s like going from Florida to Oregon—two different worlds,” Padial said of the transition. The biologists stumbled across what is likely an undocumented species of snake with vertical pupils and a black belly, and a tan-colored frog with orange eyes that is completely different from anything they’d found before. “We knew that if we could reach high altitude in this area we would find lots of new stuff,” he says.

Finding new frogs wasn’t like reaching a lost Incan city, admittedly. For the most part, the herpetologists reacted to each of their discoveries with the kind of enthusiasm a beachcomber might greet a curious shell or weird bit of flotsam.

But if there was any trophy Padial wanted from the Vilcabamba—a feather in his cap—it was a species of marsupial frog from the genus Gastrotheca, which carry their brood in dorsal pouches like eggs in a backpack. He knew that no Gastrotheca species from the area had yet been named, but he felt certain one must exist. “I would bet that the one here is probably cool,” he said. Camping in a humid dell a thousand feet below the grasslands, Padial and the others began hearing the unique tak-ta-tak call of a marsupial frog over the drizzle. The call would start and stop at random times, like a taunt.

One night after a meal of quinoa soup and dried meat, Padial went out looking with Giuseppe Gagliardi, a biologist at the Peruvian Amazon Research Institute. Gagliardi, who has lived all his life in Iquitos on the banks of the Amazon River, has a special knack for spotting frogs, and would have taken home first prize on the expedition had there been such a count.

At this higher, colder elevation, frogs and especially lizard populations were a fraction of what they were in the Amazon lowlands, but as the two walked through foliage dripping wet from fog and daily downpours, Padial sensed even lower frog activity than expected, probably due to the moonlight that filtered through the canopy. “We are always concerned about how many times the moon is going to be glowing when we plan the expedition,” he explained.

Gagliardi let out a forceful whistle, which sometimes stimulates frogs to vocalize. Not long after, they homed in on a Gastrotheca calling from high in a tree. Gagliardi took off his backpack and began to shimmy up the tree, breaking off decaying branches and bromeliads as he climbed. Suddenly, the calls stopped. Gagliardi paused and dangled there for a few minutes, but the frog never called again.

A month earlier, when Padial first arrived in Pichari at the start of the expedition, the director of Otishi National Park had introduced him to local military officials, who, in a gesture of goodwill and good public relations, offered to airlift the scientists by helicopter into the remote, central grasslands of the Vilcabamba Range. It was hard to refuse such a gift. But over the course of the expedition, nailing down that ride proved to be a relentless distraction. The general who’d extended the offer was reassigned, the military had other priorities, and the only means of receiving news from Pichari was a cell signal at 8,600 feet in the wilderness. Now, with possibly just two days of bushwhacking ahead of them before reaching the Puna—it was impossible to say for sure just how long it would be—word came that the helicopter was on.

Padial was torn. His team had spent three weeks gradually advancing up the mountain by then, erecting camps and hauling provisions. They’d already made a comprehensive inventory of the reptiles and amphibians living between 900 and 2,900 meters (3,000 and 9,500 feet), which had never been done before. With another thousand feet of thick forest to go, they were poised to break tree line, beyond which they’d face a much clearer path towards the Vilcabamba’s highest elevations. Flying there by helicopter would depend on both the fickle generosity of a local military commander and even more capricious weather. Padial had misgivings about packing everything up and hiking down. It was a gamble.

Still, time was running out, and the path ahead by foot was anything but certain. In a few days, he would lose three members of his team to prior commitments, and after Angel, the park ranger, sliced his leg with a machete, he was down to only two trailblazers. With hot showers and a rotisserie chicken meal beckoning below, Padial decided to wager on the airlift.

A few afternoons later, with clean clothes and high spirits, the team arrived at a walled-off military compound on the outskirts of Pichari. The airspace above the Apurímac valley was sunny and clear, although high in the Vilcabamba the skies appeared ominous.

“Buenissima,” Padial said, taking it all in. “I can’t believe it.” Then he corrected himself. “Well, I’ll believe it once we put our feet on that marshy grassland.” After posing for a group photo with the smiling regional general, the scientists boarded the Mil Mi-17 helicopter parked on the airfield.

The helicopter rose above Pichari, and banked around the Apurímac, ascending toward the Vilcabamba crest. The Asháninka, Efrain and his son Wilbur, snapped pictures with their cell phones as the helicopter flew over Marontuari and traced the Pichari River, following the ridgeline the team had spent weeks hiking. Beyond that, the virgin interior of the Vilcabamba unfurled below like a green shag rug, creased with steep-walled canyons and punctuated by waterfalls. As the helicopter climbed to nearly 4,000 meters (12,500 feet), it encountered a thick, chalky cloud ceiling that blanketed the upper mountains. The pilot maneuvered to find a visible path through into the highland plateau, where Padial had provided GPS coordinates for a couple of sites that, at least from satellite pictures, appeared suitable for setting up a camp. But the clouds were impenetrable. The helicopter flew in a wide circle to gain altitude: still more clouds. Stymied, the co-pilot signaled to Padial that they would have to abort the flight.

The next morning, and for the rest of that day, it poured in Pichari. With each dreary hour, Padial began to lose hope that the weather would allow another attempt in the helicopter. The military also let it be known that the ride offer had an expiration—24 hours. At daybreak the following morning, with clouds choking the upper slopes of the mountains—a familiar sight nearly every day of the four-week expedition—the team began packing for home.

Padial was crestfallen—they’d come so frustratingly close. He was annoyed at having put all his chips on the military’s shaky promise of a ride. “We lost a week in which we could’ve ascended,” he said.

Seated over ginger noodle soup that night from a street vendor in Pichari, he tried to cast the whole experience in a happier light. “The good part is that scientifically we found a lot of stuff, some beautiful new samples,” he said. Padial estimated that the expedition had yielded 14 species that are new to science, including an iguanid lizard with a sharp spiny crest, a beautiful green arboreal snake with a large bold black spot on each side of its head, and two species of Terrarana frogs belonging to a poorly known group that lives in leaf litter on the forest floor.

“It could’ve been a lot worse,” he conceded. “There could have been an accident. Someone could’ve fallen into the river.” Padial admitted to feeling relief after the team passed back through Marontuari without an incident, as he’d heard some unhappy residents were plotting to block his exit in protest.

The 30-minute helicopter flyover—offering a view of Vilcabamba’s rugged interior that few have ever witnessed—only whet Padial’s appetite even further. “I was like, ‘Wow, this is even more astonishing than I thought!’” he said over dinner. “The landscape is so much more impressive than you can see on the maps.”

Padial felt that despite falling short of his goal—a comprehensive inventory of reptiles and amphibians of the Vilcabamba from top to bottom—the expedition had demonstrated, or perhaps confirmed, something important: the Vilcabamba Range is home to many new species and many more awaiting discovery. This knowledge, he hoped, might motivate other researchers to search the area for different kinds of organisms, and over time, raise the profile of Otishi National Park as a place of unique and extraordinary biodiversity—a place worthy of future protection.

Padial’s team managed to walk out of the jungle with a bunch of specimens and tissue samples, as well as audio and video recordings, of very rare species that had never been recorded, photographed, or analyzed genetically before. All of that novel material would eventually be deposited in public collections and made available to anyone. With it, he and other researchers could begin building phylogenetic trees of species from the Vilcabamba Range, inferring when these animals split from relatives, how environmental changes have affected them, and how they got there in the first place.

Padial also believed that his efforts made a case for the value of going out and traipsing through nature in search of novel organisms—for the merit of old-fashioned fieldwork—at a time when our collective attention, and funding for science, has pivoted toward endeavors deemed relevant for technological progress: robotics, gene sequencing, and the like.

“We can tell the scientific community to leave their comfy chairs and do more fieldwork—and provide more funding for it—because we’re far from knowing what’s living out there,” he told me. “If you can still go to a place so close to a paved road and find 10 to 14 new species of frogs and reptiles in a couple of weeks, imagine how much there is still to do.”

And of course Padial continues to heed the call himself. Shortly after returning to Pittsburgh from Peru, in early March, he emailed to say that he’d already managed to secure funding to go back to the Vilcabamba in 2017.

“This time during the dry season,” he added.

“The way we’re exploring this is not much different from how Humboldt or Wallace or Darwin got to these places 200 years ago,” José Padial explained one morning last February, as gauzy light slanted into a forest clearing deep in Peru’s remote Vilcabamba Range. His team had just slashed through a mile of steep jungle with machetes, collecting dozens of specimens—from iridescent lizards to unremarkable brown frogs—many of which appeared to be new to science. Padial had almost trampled on a bushmaster, one of the hemisphere’s most dangerous snakes, and now heard rumors that some members of the local Asháninka community were plotting to block him from leaving their territory with specimens he had government permission to collect. Camped just below 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) in a damp patch of cloud forest, the herpetologist was two weeks into his expedition but still several days from his goal—the isolated grasslands atop one of South America’s least explored mountain ranges. His most reliable source of navigating the team’s route there were some low-resolution images he’d printed from Google Earth.

Not that any trail map—or trail—existed. Few humans had ever set foot on the upper reaches of the Vilcabamba Range, a northeastern spur of the Andes that juts like an archipelago into the sea of Amazon jungle. And fewer still in the half-century since two wealthy New Yorkers, Brooks Baekeland and Peter Gimbel, became the first to do so, dropping by parachute onto a 10,500-foot-high grassy plateau in 1963. Lured by stories of Incan gold, ruins, “Indian taboos” and “sacrificial lakes in the sky,” the explorers instead encountered a primeval landscape of soggy Sphagnum bog, hilly prairie, and stands of pygmy bamboo. With two companions, they spent more than two months bushwhacking down to the Amazon basin, surviving blinding wasp stings and spooked natives with bows drawn. National Geographic’s title of the account suggested a fairytale: “By Parachute into Peru’s Lost World.” Baekeland, the grandson of the inventor of Bakelite plastic, would later recall the pioneering trek “as though in a nightmare.”

“Part of me wonders if we should have parachuted into the upper part of Vilcabamba,” Padial wrote on the expedition’s Tumblr blog before leaving Pittsburgh, where the 39-year-old Spaniard serves as the Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s assistant curator of amphibians and reptiles. He knew that reaching the highlands by foot—during the height of the rainy season—would be a slog. He’d tried before, in 2008, but never made it above 1,800 meters (6,000 feet). Improvising a route through steep, tangled jungle and schlepping tents, tarps, cooking pots, camera gear, solar panels, and food for at least a dozen people between successive base camps required ample trailblazers and porters. Padial expected to have little trouble finding local Asháninka willing to work, and offered more than twice the going wage. Still, he struggled to recruit just six of them. The cold, lofty terrain, the time away from families—most able-bodied workers simply didn’t care for the job description. One porter bruised his knee after a week and went home. Another, a 14-year-old named “John Clever,” shot a kinkajou, a raccoon-like creature one night, and after gutting and smoking the animal until morning, descended with it and never returned.

Scientific exploration in the remotest parts of the world is impossible to script. Every one of Padial’s expeditions has involved some unanticipated mishap, some checked ambition. The previous year, while exploring a rugged swath of Amazonian jungle along Peru’s border with Brazil, his team showed up at an Asháninka community with 20 days’ worth of gear and provisions, and permits from local officials granting access through the territory. The community welcomed them, offered shelter for one night, and then, refused to let them pass. Complications like this come with the territory, however, and for Padial and the other biologists are the cost of achieving the ultimate goal: finding something no human has ever seen. “We all have this draw of early explorers,” he told me. “We want to go to those places where no one has been before, and be the first to find these animals.”

There is scientific importance to such a quest, of course. Each discovery brings new perspective about the planet’s biological diversity, and helps us understand how much we are losing every time we decide to bulldoze or clear-cut an area. “At the least, we leave a record behind of what there was there at a time,” Padial says. Simply knowing what lives where also helps to fill gaps in the tree of life, the genealogical relationships among species. Every undiscovered organism out there, Padial explains, is a missing link in our understanding of evolution as a whole, as species are the entities that actually evolve.

“If you don’t discover these species and give them a name, they pass unnoticed. They don’t exist.”

The Vilcabamba is filled with unnamed species, Padial believes. Biologists have long suspected that its range of elevations and wide variety of habitat types harbor a tremendous diversity of animals and plants. The few scientific expeditions ever to have penetrated its vast, untrammeled wilderness encountered several new species in “unexpected habitats or in surprising abundance,” according to one account. Logging, natural gas and oil exploration, and agriculture now threaten to fracture this pristine picture, and Padial hopes that by shedding light on the region’s richness, this expedition—officially titled the Carnegie Discoverers Expedition to Vilcabamba—might begin to make the case for its protection.

In camp, Padial poured himself a cup of rainwater-brewed coffee, and then gathered his team around an improvised table made of sticks to devise a way forward. Smoke billowed from the cooking fire, nestled against the base of a tree trunk, over which moss-covered logs had been stacked to dry. Padial laid out his Google Earth printouts and a topographic map. The satellite images showed a birds-eye view of the densely forested ridgeline they’d been tracing, the same ridgeline that continued to rise sharply above them to 2,500 meters (8,000 feet), zigzagging for a couple miles, and then sloping gradually toward a hilly prairie at around 3,200 meters (10,500 feet).

It was impossible to tell how long it might take to get there, but they had ten days to try. The team—six biologists (Spanish and Peruvian), a cook (also a Peruvian biologist), and Padial’s girlfriend, a Mexican dancer and filmmaker—was used to the uncertainties and deprivations of expedition life, anyway. Most had joined Padial on previous amphibian and reptile surveys. They hadn’t showered for days, and wore damp underwear and socks. By past standards of luxury, the French-press coffee maker that Padial had secured this time represented something five-star. More importantly, they’d heard the Vilcabamba highlands concealed a herpetological Lost City of the Incas, an irresistible quarry: frogs, toads, lizards, and snakes found nowhere else on Earth.

Padial had been looking for lost places ten years earlier, when he first spotted the 110-mile long mountain range while flying around South America on Google Earth. A rocky massif fringed with green, the Vilcabamba called to mind the tabletop mountains, called tepuis—the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World—that loom above the Venezuelan jungle like islands in the sky and host species found nowhere else on Earth. “It looked high and isolated,” Padial recalls. “I thought, ‘Wow, it would be amazing to go there.’”

The Vilcabamba Range emerges out of the steamy Amazonian lowlands, at an elevation of around 450 meters (1,500 feet), and climbs to a jagged, central crest above 4,200 meters (14,000 feet). The local native groups—the Asháninka, Matsiguenga, Nomatsiguenga, and Yine—never settled the lofty interior, finding it too cold, wet, and lacking good soil and game. It remains largely virgin, free of roads, and enjoying token protection within the boundaries of Otishi National Park and two indigenous reserves. Cut off from the eastern slope of the Andes by the Apurimac and Ene rivers, a main source of the Amazon, and moated by deep valleys and gorges on all sides, its isolation has set the stage for a wide range of endemic flora and fauna to evolve. A frog living at 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) in the Vilcabamba cloud forest would have a long way to hop across several thousand vertical feet, through several foreign habitats, to reach familiar turf across the Apurimac. No chance. “The species that live in the upper area have probably been isolated from the rest of their relatives for a very long time,” Padial explained. Exactly how long these organisms have been isolated is one of the things he and the others aim to figure out.

The mountains are in a rich neighborhood already, ecologically speaking. The tropical Andes is considered one of the world’s 35 biodiversity “hotspots,” boasting the highest percentage of endemic plant and vertebrate species—creatures like the yellow-eared parrot (Ognorhynchus icterotis) and spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus). A recent survey of Manu National Park and its buffer zone, along the eastern slope of the Andes in southeastern Peru, counted 287 reptile and amphibian species (as well as more than 1,000 species of birds—around 10 percent of the world’s total) living there alone: the most diversity found in any protected area on the planet.

Lying 100 miles northwest of Manu as the parrot flies, the Vilcabamba Range, in contrast, remains terra incognita. Tough to access, no other area in the Andes of even remotely comparable size is still so poorly known to biologists. It has never been all that welcoming. Throughout the 1980s and ’90s, the Ene-Apurimac Valley was the heartland of the Shining Path, the Maoist guerrillas who terrorized Peru. Nowadays, the area is the world’s largest producer of coca, whose leaves are refined into paste at clandestine camps in the forest. Just south of Padial’s route, drug mules by the hundreds cross the Vilcabamba by foot, with medics and armed escorts. Encounters with traffickers can be tragic: Members of a Bolivian scientific team were slain in that country’s Noel Kempff Mercado National Park in 1986 after their aircraft inadvertently landed beside a clandestine coca-paste factory.

The few research efforts undertaken in the Vilcabamba Range over the years have managed to paint a picture of exceptional biodiversity. In the late 1960s, American ornithologists John Terborgh and John Weske mounted a series of landmark expeditions to study bird community structure along an altitudinal gradient from 600 to 3,520 meters (2,000 to 11,500 feet)—basically what Padial hoped to mimic for amphibians and reptiles. They recorded 405 species on the mountains’ western slopes alone. (It’s estimated that the Vilcabamba Range may contain more than half of all bird species known from Peru.) Then, in 1997, Conservation International and Smithsonian Institution surveys found many new species, including a pale grey tree rat the size of a domestic cat. Their report declared the area “a special place in relation to biodiversity.”

Padial’s first expedition there was sort of a misadventure. In 2008, he and his former Ph.D. advisor, Ignacio de la Riva, a biologist from Spain’s National Museum of Natural Sciences, led a team that attempted to reach the highlands by following a river upstream from Kimbiri, a tropical town along the Apurimac. Mapping a distance of five miles, Padial figured they could get there in two days of solid hiking. The terrain, however, proved far steeper, muddier and harder to penetrate than one could glean from a satellite image. After two weeks, exhausted and hungry, they turned back.

Padial knew better this time. He spent two years planning the expedition, securing funds from Carnegie Museum donors and permits from Peruvian government agencies. He’d negotiated delicately with the residents of Marontuari, the Asháninka community at the base of the ridge, gamely sipping their alcoholic homebrew of fermented yucca root from a hollowed gourd as they spoke about the threats to their territory from encroaching coca plantations and a planned hydroelectric dam, as well as their reservations about Padial himself. “They are very suspicious about what we do with the samples,” he says. “To them, it’s just weird, the whole idea of conservation—that someone goes and collects these animals that no one pays attention to. If you put money into something, [they figure] you’re going to get something.”

Rather than clamber upriver, his plan this time was to drive an hour into the Vilcabamba up a dirt road from Pichari, a sleepy town along the Apurimac, until it dead-ended in Marontuari. Bushwhacking from there to the highlands, his team would pitch successive base camps—where flat ground permitted—as the environment transitioned from lowland montane forest to cloud forest, elfin forest, and finally, the Puna grasslands, a treeless region found across the central Andes between 3,200 and 4,000 meters (10,500 and 13,000 feet).

When Baekeland’s team parachuted there in the 1960s, they glimpsed an Andean spectacled bear and a Peruvian puma, but little else. Three decades later, the biologists working with Conservation International—landing by helicopter—spotted guinea pigs, numerous grass mice, and a large arboreal rodent (family Abrocomidae) that resembled one known only from bones excavated from pre-Columbian burial sites at Machu Picchu, farther south. They collected just four species of reptiles and amphibians—three frogs and one lizard—but all appeared new to science.

For Padial, the promise of scientific discovery is what had lured him to herpetology. As an undergraduate in Spain, studying biology, he volunteered on a couple of field expeditions in the Bolivian jungle and kept finding it a struggle to identify the amphibians and reptiles he observed. Even today, no general field guide yet exists for reptiles and amphibians of the Amazon. While some 7,500 species of amphibians have been identified worldwide, untold thousands remain at large. Since 1985, the total number of recognized species has increased by more than 60 percent—a new species of amphibian is described in the scientific literature every 2.5 days. Yet knowledge of their diversity and distribution pales in comparison to what scientists understand about birds and mammals. “It’s just amazing how much there is to do,” Padial says.

In the past decade, he’s launched several successful, globe-spanning expeditions, including three trips to Mauritania that resulted in the first species accounts of amphibians and reptiles for that country, as well as a pioneering excursion into Peru’s Alto Purús National Park, a wild, poorly known patch of Amazonian rainforest home to several uncontacted nomadic tribes, that yielded several new species.

Putting animals on the map of science can serve a conservation goal, too. The Vilcabamba Range stands as one of the last intact tropical montane forests left in South America, a species-rich belt that once ran the length of the eastern Andes, from northern Venezuela south to Bolivia. Yet along its lower flanks, the elevation holding the most biodiversity, the forest is being destroyed at an alarming rate to make way for coca and coffee plantations. Illegal logging also chips away. Much of the interior is within the bounds of two indigenous reserves and Otishi National Park, but the park’s staff, which includes eight rangers charged with policing 1,100 square miles (an area the size of United States’ Yosemite National Park), have few resources to combat encroachment, not to mention drug traffickers traipsing around with weapons. Perhaps by shedding a light on the unique and extraordinary life in the Vilcabamba, scientific efforts like Padial’s could help Otishi acquire the resources needed for more robust protection, like those afforded to Manu National Park. And maybe somewhere high in “Peru’s Lost World” there lives a charismatic, endemic species of frog yet to be discovered that could become an emblem for conservation.

Throughout the expedition, the scientists often encountered animals by happenstance—a lizard found skittering between campfire logs, a frog startled during a walk to pee. But since many amphibians are nocturnal, the best chance of finding them is to go probing after dark. One evening at Camp 2, as with most nights, Padial and the others strapped on headlamps and set out to collect. He wore rubber boots, square-rimmed glasses, and a collared shirt with pens tucked into the breast pocket. The group fanned out along with trail, walking slowly. They scanned leaves and tree trunks and poked at the wet leaf litter with sticks. Soon, Padial’s light reflected off the eyes of a small brown frog perched haplessly atop a leaf. He snatched the animal up, and holding it under the beam of his headlamp by its legs, gave it a quick taxonomic spot check.

Padial specializes in New World “direct developers” (Terrarana), a sprawling group of frog families ranging from Texas to northern Argentina. Instead of laying eggs in water that hatch into tadpoles, Terrarana frogs deposit their eggs in moist dirt, or moss, out of which emerge fully formed juveniles. Most of the frogs and toads in the Vilcabamba were of this type, as the steep slopes allow for few ponds or standing water.

Padial could tell immediately that the frog belonged to the genus Pristimantis, a large group of mostly terrestrial direct developers. But he was looking for traits that might help place the frog more precisely on the family tree. Did it have an exposed tympanum (ear drum)? Sticky toe pads? Was its belly transparent or pigmented, glandular or smooth? What kind of dot pattern colored the inner thigh for signaling the opposite sex? A few days earlier, Padial had collected a frog that at first glance resembled one he’d collected on a previous trip to the Amazon. But on closer inspection, he noticed its sharper snout and transparent peritoneum, the spider web like membrane covering the organs that on some frogs is pigmented. “Those are like the differences between a chimp and a human, like being fully covered by hair or not,” Padial explained. “I think it was a new species.”

He plopped the Pristimantis into a clear plastic bag along with some leaves to keep the frog moist. Searching for and catching animals was the fun part—Padial had been doing that since he was a kid, hunting snakes near his grandfather’s house on the outskirts of Granada, Spain. Later came the humdrum tasks: measuring frogs, counting scales, and analyzing anatomy, bone structure, mating calls, genes, distribution patterns and climate data. “You need music for that,” Padial confessed. The team’s forest lab amounted to a stick table covered by a rain poncho, surrounded by bags containing frogs, toads and lizards. Each specimen was first euthanized with a dose of Lidocaine, the numbing drug used by dentists, and tagged with a number. With tweezers, the researchers would then extract a tiny sample of thigh tissue for later genetic analysis, and finally inject formalin to fix the animal’s shape.

With data from his two Vilcabamba expeditions, combined with findings from the CI-Smithsonian surveys in the ’90s—the herpetological specimens collected then had yet to be fully analyzed—Padial hoped to assemble the best existing catalog of amphibians and reptiles in the Vilcabamba Range.

Although Padial and his team made important discoveries on the way up, in a sense this was all a means to an end. The ultimate goal was to survey the Vilcabamba’s upper reaches, a haven for endemic species. On the third week, an advance team that included Padial, a Asháninka father and son from Marontuari, and Angel Castellano, an Otishi park ranger, managed to hack a way through to 2,760 meters (9,055 feet). Their track wound past twisted branches carpeted with epiphytic mosses, and sprawling tree root systems that required vertical rock-climbing maneuvers. Passing over gaps in the vegetation where losing one’s footing could mean falling off a precipice, it made the well-maintained Pacific Crest Trail look like the Champs-Élysées by comparison.

Along the exposed ridge top, the cloud forest became a bushy elfin forest of tree ferns, bamboo, and reedy grasses. During breaks in the fog, creeping up from the valley, you could make out the jagged crest of the Vilcabamba Range, still some distance above. The change in scenery came with a host of new creatures; species like the cartoonishly bloated cane toad and electric blue poison-dart frog the team collected around Camp 1 were nowhere to be found. “It’s like going from Florida to Oregon—two different worlds,” Padial said of the transition. The biologists stumbled across what is likely an undocumented species of snake with vertical pupils and a black belly, and a tan-colored frog with orange eyes that is completely different from anything they’d found before. “We knew that if we could reach high altitude in this area we would find lots of new stuff,” he says.

Finding new frogs wasn’t like reaching a lost Incan city, admittedly. For the most part, the herpetologists reacted to each of their discoveries with the kind of enthusiasm a beachcomber might greet a curious shell or weird bit of flotsam.

But if there was any trophy Padial wanted from the Vilcabamba—a feather in his cap—it was a species of marsupial frog from the genus Gastrotheca, which carry their brood in dorsal pouches like eggs in a backpack. He knew that no Gastrotheca species from the area had yet been named, but he felt certain one must exist. “I would bet that the one here is probably cool,” he said. Camping in a humid dell a thousand feet below the grasslands, Padial and the others began hearing the unique tak-ta-tak call of a marsupial frog over the drizzle. The call would start and stop at random times, like a taunt.

One night after a meal of quinoa soup and dried meat, Padial went out looking with Giuseppe Gagliardi, a biologist at the Peruvian Amazon Research Institute. Gagliardi, who has lived all his life in Iquitos on the banks of the Amazon River, has a special knack for spotting frogs, and would have taken home first prize on the expedition had there been such a count.

At this higher, colder elevation, frogs and especially lizard populations were a fraction of what they were in the Amazon lowlands, but as the two walked through foliage dripping wet from fog and daily downpours, Padial sensed even lower frog activity than expected, probably due to the moonlight that filtered through the canopy. “We are always concerned about how many times the moon is going to be glowing when we plan the expedition,” he explained.

Gagliardi let out a forceful whistle, which sometimes stimulates frogs to vocalize. Not long after, they homed in on a Gastrotheca calling from high in a tree. Gagliardi took off his backpack and began to shimmy up the tree, breaking off decaying branches and bromeliads as he climbed. Suddenly, the calls stopped. Gagliardi paused and dangled there for a few minutes, but the frog never called again.

A month earlier, when Padial first arrived in Pichari at the start of the expedition, the director of Otishi National Park had introduced him to local military officials, who, in a gesture of goodwill and good public relations, offered to airlift the scientists by helicopter into the remote, central grasslands of the Vilcabamba Range. It was hard to refuse such a gift. But over the course of the expedition, nailing down that ride proved to be a relentless distraction. The general who’d extended the offer was reassigned, the military had other priorities, and the only means of receiving news from Pichari was a cell signal at 8,600 feet in the wilderness. Now, with possibly just two days of bushwhacking ahead of them before reaching the Puna—it was impossible to say for sure just how long it would be—word came that the helicopter was on.

Padial was torn. His team had spent three weeks gradually advancing up the mountain by then, erecting camps and hauling provisions. They’d already made a comprehensive inventory of the reptiles and amphibians living between 900 and 2,900 meters (3,000 and 9,500 feet), which had never been done before. With another thousand feet of thick forest to go, they were poised to break tree line, beyond which they’d face a much clearer path towards the Vilcabamba’s highest elevations. Flying there by helicopter would depend on both the fickle generosity of a local military commander and even more capricious weather. Padial had misgivings about packing everything up and hiking down. It was a gamble.

Still, time was running out, and the path ahead by foot was anything but certain. In a few days, he would lose three members of his team to prior commitments, and after Angel, the park ranger, sliced his leg with a machete, he was down to only two trailblazers. With hot showers and a rotisserie chicken meal beckoning below, Padial decided to wager on the airlift.

A few afternoons later, with clean clothes and high spirits, the team arrived at a walled-off military compound on the outskirts of Pichari. The airspace above the Apurímac valley was sunny and clear, although high in the Vilcabamba the skies appeared ominous.

“Buenissima,” Padial said, taking it all in. “I can’t believe it.” Then he corrected himself. “Well, I’ll believe it once we put our feet on that marshy grassland.” After posing for a group photo with the smiling regional general, the scientists boarded the Mil Mi-17 helicopter parked on the airfield.

The helicopter rose above Pichari, and banked around the Apurímac, ascending toward the Vilcabamba crest. The Asháninka, Efrain and his son Wilbur, snapped pictures with their cell phones as the helicopter flew over Marontuari and traced the Pichari River, following the ridgeline the team had spent weeks hiking. Beyond that, the virgin interior of the Vilcabamba unfurled below like a green shag rug, creased with steep-walled canyons and punctuated by waterfalls. As the helicopter climbed to nearly 4,000 meters (12,500 feet), it encountered a thick, chalky cloud ceiling that blanketed the upper mountains. The pilot maneuvered to find a visible path through into the highland plateau, where Padial had provided GPS coordinates for a couple of sites that, at least from satellite pictures, appeared suitable for setting up a camp. But the clouds were impenetrable. The helicopter flew in a wide circle to gain altitude: still more clouds. Stymied, the co-pilot signaled to Padial that they would have to abort the flight.

The next morning, and for the rest of that day, it poured in Pichari. With each dreary hour, Padial began to lose hope that the weather would allow another attempt in the helicopter. The military also let it be known that the ride offer had an expiration—24 hours. At daybreak the following morning, with clouds choking the upper slopes of the mountains—a familiar sight nearly every day of the four-week expedition—the team began packing for home.

Padial was crestfallen—they’d come so frustratingly close. He was annoyed at having put all his chips on the military’s shaky promise of a ride. “We lost a week in which we could’ve ascended,” he said.

Seated over ginger noodle soup that night from a street vendor in Pichari, he tried to cast the whole experience in a happier light. “The good part is that scientifically we found a lot of stuff, some beautiful new samples,” he said. Padial estimated that the expedition had yielded 14 species that are new to science, including an iguanid lizard with a sharp spiny crest, a beautiful green arboreal snake with a large bold black spot on each side of its head, and two species of Terrarana frogs belonging to a poorly known group that lives in leaf litter on the forest floor.

“It could’ve been a lot worse,” he conceded. “There could have been an accident. Someone could’ve fallen into the river.” Padial admitted to feeling relief after the team passed back through Marontuari without an incident, as he’d heard some unhappy residents were plotting to block his exit in protest.

The 30-minute helicopter flyover—offering a view of Vilcabamba’s rugged interior that few have ever witnessed—only whet Padial’s appetite even further. “I was like, ‘Wow, this is even more astonishing than I thought!’” he said over dinner. “The landscape is so much more impressive than you can see on the maps.”

Padial felt that despite falling short of his goal—a comprehensive inventory of reptiles and amphibians of the Vilcabamba from top to bottom—the expedition had demonstrated, or perhaps confirmed, something important: the Vilcabamba Range is home to many new species and many more awaiting discovery. This knowledge, he hoped, might motivate other researchers to search the area for different kinds of organisms, and over time, raise the profile of Otishi National Park as a place of unique and extraordinary biodiversity—a place worthy of future protection.

Padial’s team managed to walk out of the jungle with a bunch of specimens and tissue samples, as well as audio and video recordings, of very rare species that had never been recorded, photographed, or analyzed genetically before. All of that novel material would eventually be deposited in public collections and made available to anyone. With it, he and other researchers could begin building phylogenetic trees of species from the Vilcabamba Range, inferring when these animals split from relatives, how environmental changes have affected them, and how they got there in the first place.

Padial also believed that his efforts made a case for the value of going out and traipsing through nature in search of novel organisms—for the merit of old-fashioned fieldwork—at a time when our collective attention, and funding for science, has pivoted toward endeavors deemed relevant for technological progress: robotics, gene sequencing, and the like.

“We can tell the scientific community to leave their comfy chairs and do more fieldwork—and provide more funding for it—because we’re far from knowing what’s living out there,” he told me. “If you can still go to a place so close to a paved road and find 10 to 14 new species of frogs and reptiles in a couple of weeks, imagine how much there is still to do.”

And of course Padial continues to heed the call himself. Shortly after returning to Pittsburgh from Peru, in early March, he emailed to say that he’d already managed to secure funding to go back to the Vilcabamba in 2017.

“This time during the dry season,” he added.

0,"THE national president of the Australian Veterinary Association got a rude shock when he was bitten by a venomous snake for the first time in four decades.

And not just any snake — an eastern brown, considered the world’s second most venomous land snake.

“In 41 years I would have handled thousands of snakes but I’ve never been bitten by a venomous snake or (venomous) spider,” said Dr Robert Johnson.

The vet was hospitalised for four days after he was bitten on the arm by an injured adult Eastern brown he was treating at his South Penrith Veterinary Clinic on March 6.

“It’s usually shorter than that but I had some complications; it’s all okay now, I’m fine,” assured Dr Johnson, 63, who was back at work on Monday.

He was lucky.

From December 2001 to January 2013 five per cent of the total 260 people bitten by brown snakes nationally died, according to the Emergency Care Institute, whose primary role is to improve outcomes for patients presenting at hospital emergency departments across NSW.

The snake that bit Dr Johnson had been brought in to him by a professional snake handler with an injured tail.

“My snake keeper and the nurse straight away knew what to do and applied a pressure bandage and I knew to stay calm,” said Dr Johnson.

“The paramedics and the hospital (Nepean) did an amazing job. Thank you to everyone for all their good wishes.”

Commenting on the seriousness of his injury, Dr Johnson offered this take-home message: “Stay calm. Have a plan. Know your first aid, and get cracking — get to the hospital. Don’t delay.”

He said the majority of people bitten by snakes were snake handlers.

SNAKE AND SPIDER BITES NEPEAN-BLUE MOUNTAINS

NSW Ambulance treated 34 patients for suspected snake or spider bites in the Nepean Blue Mountains region in the six months to February 28.

The paramedic services’ spokesman said they had responded to 530 snake and spider bites across NSW from September 1 to February 28, including 38 suspected funnel-web bites.

In the western Sydney region, 28 patients were treated for suspected snake or spider bites by NSW Ambulance.

Local incidents included a 10-year-old girl being bitten on the toe by a spider at Tregear (January 14); a 45-year-old man being bitten by a spider at Faulconbridge (December 20); and a 46-year-old woman being bitten by a spider at North St Marys (January 16).

The NSW Ambulance spokesman said first aid for snake and spider bites “varies depending on the species”.

NSW AMBULANCE TIPS

For snakes and funnel-web spiders:

■ If bitten, call 000.

■ If the bite is on a limb, apply a pressure immobilisation bandage. The bandage should not cut off the circulation;

■ If the bite is not on a limb, apply direct, firm pressure to the bite site with your hands. Keep the patient still and discourage them from walking around; and

■ Never cut or excise the wound. Do not attempt to suck out the venom and don’t apply a tourniquet.

And not just any snake — an eastern brown, considered the world’s second most venomous land snake.

“In 41 years I would have handled thousands of snakes but I’ve never been bitten by a venomous snake or (venomous) spider,” said Dr Robert Johnson.

The vet was hospitalised for four days after he was bitten on the arm by an injured adult Eastern brown he was treating at his South Penrith Veterinary Clinic on March 6.

“It’s usually shorter than that but I had some complications; it’s all okay now, I’m fine,” assured Dr Johnson, 63, who was back at work on Monday.

He was lucky.

From December 2001 to January 2013 five per cent of the total 260 people bitten by brown snakes nationally died, according to the Emergency Care Institute, whose primary role is to improve outcomes for patients presenting at hospital emergency departments across NSW.

The snake that bit Dr Johnson had been brought in to him by a professional snake handler with an injured tail.

“My snake keeper and the nurse straight away knew what to do and applied a pressure bandage and I knew to stay calm,” said Dr Johnson.

“The paramedics and the hospital (Nepean) did an amazing job. Thank you to everyone for all their good wishes.”

Commenting on the seriousness of his injury, Dr Johnson offered this take-home message: “Stay calm. Have a plan. Know your first aid, and get cracking — get to the hospital. Don’t delay.”

He said the majority of people bitten by snakes were snake handlers.

0,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Last year, the Bramble Cay melomys, an Australian rodent, was declared extinct. Its habitat, a grassy island in the Great Barrier Reef, was wrecked by rising sea levels and conservation neglect. While it was the first mammal whose disappearance was attributed to climate change, many other species are on the brink of extinction due to human-made threats, including shifting tides, habitat destruction, hunting, and war.

The loss of a whole species we may never have personally encountered can feel abstract. Next of Kin: Seeing Extinction through the Artist’s Lens, now on view at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH), aims to create an emotional engagement. The exhibition by artist Christina Seely in collaboration with the Canary Project, an ecologically focused collective, features Seely’s photography alongside objects from Harvard’s Museum of Comparative Zoology, part of the HMNH complex. The latter are recontextualized within a contemplative narrative of vanishing biodiversity.

“The whole of the exhibition was designed as a kind of space of reverence that offers an emotional bridge between art and science within this natural history museum context,” Seely told Hyperallergic. “It really is both a space to mourn and deal with the emotions that accompany the facts related to contemporary extinction, but also an experience that helps the viewer connect to the stories of these animals.”

It’s an exhibition that rewards extended time in the gallery, too. Seely created a series of 10 light box Next of Kin Portraits of taxidermy endangered animals on view in HMNH. They gradually light up and fade, so that at one moment the face of a jaguar is barely visible in mirrored glass, while at another point it gazes directly into your eyes. A sound piece by Matthew Patterson-Curry grows more cacophonous as the portraits become more distinct, with human-made noise giving way to the calls of extinct birds. On a nearby wall are Seely’s Species Impact daguerreotypes of animals currently under threat due to climate change in the arctic and tropics, including the snowy owl and American flamingo. As with the light boxes, it’s impossible to look at the daguerreotypes without seeing yourself reflected.

“The immersive experience and elements of discovery are designed to help the viewer slow down and engage with the space, linger, and want to learn more,” Seely explained. “Each piece is centered around evoking a profound sense of empathy with our ‘next of kin,’ so the use of the mirrored surfaces, the direct eye contact with the animals, and the poetics in the texts and sculptural installations are key to inspiring connection.”

The nine sculptural installations, made with Ed Morris and Susannah Sayler of the Canary Project, feature physical remains of animals both extinct and endangered. Horns of a giant sable antelope, which is critically endangered by military conflict and a restricted range in Angola, have stunning curves and ridges. The tiny egg of an extinct heath hen is protected by a huge mound of cotton that visually reinforces the preciousness of the diminutive artifact. (The final heath hen, nicknamed “Booming Ben” for its call, which could carry further than a gunshot, died on Martha’s Vineyard in 1932.) Boxes of bones from the great auk hint at how populous the flightless bird once was, until the predator-free species encountered humans, who took advantage of its fatal trust and stuffed pillows with its feathers. A great auk was last seen in 1844 on Iceland’s Eldey Island.

Other objects require more attention to perceive, such as a North Island giant moa visible only through bird-shaped slats. On the front of its black box is an unlabeled peephole, through which you can glimpse a small Mappin’s moa feather. The wingless moas were an older loss, eradicated centuries ago due to overhunting in New Zealand. Nearby, a poem by W. S. Merwin, called “Far Company,” acts as a eulogy for them: “At times now from some margin of the day / I can hear birds of another country / not the whole song but a brief phrase of it / out of a music that I may have heard … ”

While exploring Next of Kin, under the gaze of Seely’s light box animals and the artificial eyes of a “herd” of animal heads, I was reminded of the Room of Extinct and Endangered Animals at the Grande Galerie de l’Évolution in Paris. Unlike the rest of the French museum, which is brightly lit and lively with schoolchildren racing around the displays, that gallery is darkly illuminated, with taxidermy specimens including the extinct Tasmanian tiger and Schomburgk’s deer of Thailand positioned like specters in glass cabinets. Some, such as the only surviving black emu skeleton, are so obliterated they’re down to fragments. There’s a feeling of being in a hallowed chamber that acknowledges the death of these animals in a way that most natural history dioramas do not.

After visiting Next of Kin, I found that the experience of it followed me through the Harvard museum, where I noticed the Siberian tiger and African hunting dog that had appeared in Seely’s light boxes among the crowds of taxidermy. One of the institution’s historic rooms, the Great Mammal Hall, has changed little since it was built in 1872, with gargantuan whale skeletons suspended over cases and cases of specimens, including one tall enough for a full-size giraffe. Museums with 19th-century displays like this are sometimes perceived as obsolete, especially as science and natural history institutions move towards more interactive, modern exhibitions. Yet Next of Kin argues that these collections remain essential, for a better understanding of the ongoing human impact on the Earth’s environment and our failures in the past.

“The exhibition is in conversation with the whole of the museum and its collections, so it uses the language of museum conservation — say, in the use of materials, boxes, jars, and labeling that are used to store and conserve specimens — and of course the actual animals that can be found in neighboring halls,” Seely stated. “At the same time, the exhibition subverts what the viewer expects to find, leaving questions unanswered, versus the expected answers they tend to find in other spaces focused on a different way of talking about or explaining science.”

0,"Pressed against the exhibit’s glass, parents and children “ooh” as the leopard Nelkan prowls across a log to rest. Despite his nocturnal nature, the big cat has become one of the Greenville Zoo’s star attractions since he arrived from Berlin last year.

But many guests aren’t aware of Nelkan’s true purpose. “This is an important move for the species, as it will introduce another bloodline into the North American population,” says Greenville Zoo administrator Jeff Bullock.

The Amur leopard is one of the world’s rarest big cat species, with just 70 in the wild and 200 in captivity. Their numbers have been dwindling for decades due to poaching for their fur, as well as the loss of natural habitat and diseases.

In 2016, there were 14 Amur leopard births, three of which happened in zoos across North America, according to Bullock. Nelkan, an 11-year-old male, has been paired with the zoo’s 7-year-old female Amur leopard, Jade, to boost that number.

The cats are part of the Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 1981 to help ensure the survival of selected species, most of which are threatened or endangered.

The program, which protects nearly 500 species, ensures that captive populations remain genetically able to reproduce without taking animals from the wild. In this way, a captive population is bred in the event it is needed for a reintroduction program to save the species from extinction in the wild.

“Some animals only exist in captivity and more only exist in the wild because they’ve been boosted by captive bred animals,” Bullock said. “Our zoo, like many others, is much more than just a collection of animals and more important than ever.”

The Greenville Zoo, which houses an estimated 176 SSP animals, has fostered several births of threatened or endangered species since 2000. The ocelot couple Oz and Evita welcomed their second set of kittens in March. Bullock says Nelkan and Jade should produce at least one cub before 2018.

All creatures great and small

Over the past century, zoos have played a crucial role in saving hundreds of species from extinction. While most of the work has stemmed from breeding, more and more zoos are funding conservation in the field or even starting their own conservation programs. Bullock said the Greenville Zoo has spent more than $300,000 on conservation over the last seven years.

In 2010, the zoo’s conservation committee launched the Quarters for Conservation program to meet accreditation standards by creating a funding source for local and global conservation efforts.For each admission purchase, visitors receive a token representing 25 cents of their admission fee. Visitors use their tokens to vote for one of five highlighted conservation programs at a kiosk located at the zoo’s entrance.

“The conservation projects change yearly and the amount each project receives is directly related to the number of votes it receives from our zoo guests,” Bullock said.

In addition to funding from the general admission fee, the zoo allocates $3 from each annual membership fee to a fund for conservation. Each year, 50 percent of the program’s funds go directly to staff-selected projects, which currently include restoration of the Fijian crested iguana on the island of Monuriki; and efforts to help the Sumatran orangutan, Chilean flamingo, Amur leopard, and Angolan Colobus monkey.

“Quarters for Conservation gives our more than 300,000 annual visitors a way to connect with these conservation programs, and feel the power to make a difference,” Bullock said.

The program’s remaining funds are used to support grants to nonprofits, individuals, and educational entities with shared interests in conservation and research, and a small percentage is set aside for on-site conservation, research, and administration.

In 2011, the Greenville Zoo established a grant program for conservation efforts in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia that awards between $300 and $1,000 to recipients. The zoo also established a grant program for international efforts that awards up to $3,000.

The zoo has since funded more than 20 projects. It plans to award $12,910 to nine projects this year, according to Nikolay Kapustin, veterinarian and deputy zoo administrator. The request will go before Greenville City Council later this month.

Brad Lock, assistant curator of herpetology at Zoo Atlanta, has received more than $5,000 from the Greenville Zoo since 2013 to restore oak tree habitat for the critically endangered arboreal alligator lizard in central Guatemala.

“We’ve planted 60,000 trees, and it wouldn’t haven’t been possible without the Greenville Zoo’s support,” said Lock, director of Guatemalan programs for the International Reptile Conservation Foundation. “They’ve got the right attitude about conservation.”

Conservation in action

In 2008, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums estimated zoos and aquariums were spending around $252 million on conservation efforts every year, including captive breeding inside the institutions and supporting work in the field.

Some zoos are taking creative approaches to conservation, including efforts to educate the public about the plight of the world’s endangered species. For instance, the Greenville Zoo partnered with Furman University in 2014 to launch a free conservation lecture series.

The series, held periodically at the Children’s Museum in downtown Greenville, has since featured presentations about various critically endangered species ranging from Mexican gray wolves to orangutans to okapi.

“The goal is to help the public understand the importance of being responsible stewards of the planet,” said Kapustin. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a student or businessperson from downtown. We just want everyone to come out to the lectures.”

Many zoos also educate conservation workers in foreign countries or send keepers abroad to contribute their skills and knowledge to zoos and preserves helping to improve conditions and reintroductions all over the world. For instance, the Greenville Zoo has launched a scholarship program to send staff on overseas conservation missions.

Jennifer Stahl, a zookeeper, was awarded about $2,000 in 2016 to visit Malaysia’s Melaka Zoo and Night Safari. While there, she spent two weeks renovating exhibits, participating in orangutan conservation efforts, and teaching foreign handlers training techniques.

“It was an eye-opening trip, because I realized we can impact international conservation,” Stahl said. “They’re trying to protect animals from extinction like us, but they need money. Luckily, we’re able to help through our Quarters for Conservation program.”

The future of conservation

In 2015, the AZA called on zoos to spend at least 3 percent of their operating budgets on conservation. The call comes after scientists have warned that human activities are pushing life on Earth toward a mass extinction event.

According to the World Wildlife Fund, global populations of vertebrates have dropped by a staggering 52 percent from 1970 to 2010; during the same time, the number of humans on the planet has grown by nearly 3 billion.

Now the Greenville Zoo is attempting to step up its conservation goals.

The city’s 2017-2018 budget proposal includes an increase in zoo admission. The cost to enter would increase by $1 and individual memberships would increase by $10. Some of the funds would go to Quarters for Conservation, allowing the program to collect 50 cents instead of 25 cents from each admission and $5 dollars instead of $3 for each membership.

City Council is set to give final approval on May 22. If approved, the increased rates would take effect on July 1. “Our zoo can become a force for conservation,” said Kapustin. “The proposed increases would double our conservation fund and provide more money for various research projects across the globe.”

The city’s $185.4 million budget proposal also calls for a $1 million investment in the zoo’s master plan. The money, which comes from the city’s tourism tax, is part of a $3 million pledge to complete the plan’s first phase, which costs an estimated $15 million.

The first phase includes a 10,000-square-foot tiger exhibit with a glass viewing wall, tiger training wall, overlooks, waterfalls, streams, and artificial rockwork and exhibit spaces for Asian bears, siamangs, and birds.

The zoo is considering Sumatran or Malayan tigers for the exhibit, according to Bullock. Each of the tiger subspecies are thought to number less than 500 in the wild as they’re in high demand in many parts of Asia and Indonesia for traditional medicine.

“We identified the Sumatran and Malayan tigers as the species that could have the largest impact on conservation,” said Bullock. “Our guests might see some cubs running around here at some point in the future.”

He also said the zoo is exploring sponsorship opportunities with Clemson University so researchers can study the tigers. The exhibit would feature a research lab and holding area beside the den. It would have glass windows for observing.

Phase one of the zoo’s master plan also calls for upgrades to the lion exhibit that meet the AZA’s required standards for breeding. The zoo plans to obtain a female lion for breeding purposes sometime in the future, according to Bullock.

African lion populations have declined 43 percent in the last two decades due to habitat loss, difficulty finding prey, and conflicts with humans. Certain subspecies were protected under U.S. law in 2015, months after the killing of Cecil the lion stoked global outrage.

The master plan also includes a “Blue Ridge Backyard” exhibit, which could house a bear, otters, wolves, and other regional animals. “Many people don’t know about our region’s animals,” said Bullock. “The exhibit will give us an opportunity to discuss conservation, because our animals are running out of places to go due to the region’s rapid growth.”

From Greenville to Guyana

Guyana’s people call the country’s inland “the bush.” It encompasses tens of thousands of square miles of South American rain forest and savannah, and it’s home to more wildlife than people.

“It’s very pristine in most of the country unlike certain Latin American areas where there is intense habitat loss,” said Kapustin. “There is a great sense of awareness of the need for sustainable practices within Guyana natural areas.”

Kapustin has been to the country’s interior on numerous occasions. During his time as senior veterinarian for the Jacksonville Zoo in 2006, Kapustin traveled more than 2,000 miles to the Guyana Zoo, which is located in the capital of Georgetown, to transport two jaguars and one giant otter to Jacksonville.

Guyana had previously signed an agreement with the Jacksonville Zoo for a cooperative conservation initiative focused on wildlife surveys; support for policy, legislation, and development; and environmental education at the Guyana Zoo.

Kapustin has since maintained his relationships and collaborations with the zoo. He hopes to bring some of them to Greenville. “It would be great to participate in efforts to assist with garnering more awareness of conservation practices and identifying baseline wildlife information there,” Kapustin said.

Currently, Kapustin is working to identify conservation efforts in Guyana that he and his colleagues could participate in through staff scholarships. Some of those possible efforts include education and capacity building at the Guyana Zoo, which according to Kapustin, is key to increasing environmental awareness among the country’s urban population.

Other possible efforts could include collaborative work to protect the country’s jaguars.

“I’m looking forward to possibly continuing and identifying wildlife studies there in which we could participate for the benefit of their native wildlife management. They have some they are currently doing already,” Kapustin said.

Globally, jaguars are declining due to habitat loss and conflict with humans. As a result, they are listed as a near-threatened species. Guyana represents one of 18 Latin American countries that houses jaguars.

The Ministry of Natural Resource and other agencies have collaborated with international organizations over the years to survey Guyana’s jaguars, educate the public, and mitigate conflicts between jaguars and people.

Kapustin said conservation efforts could also span to other South American countries.

“Our efforts may dovetail in some efforts with Brazil,” said Kapustin. “Obviously, adjacent countries such as this have wildlife, like giant anteaters, that traverse the borders and can inhabit either country so there is nice continuity of such corridors and shows how wildlife can connect countries in such fashion.”

Despite his nocturnal nature, the big cat has become one of the Greenville Zoo’s star attractions since he arrived from Berlin last year.

But many guests aren’t aware of Nelkan’s true purpose. “This is an important move for the species, as it will introduce another bloodline into the North American population,” says Greenville Zoo administrator Jeff Bullock.

The Amur leopard is one of the world’s rarest big cat species, with just 70 in the wild and 200 in captivity. Their numbers have been dwindling for decades due to poaching for their fur, as well as the loss of natural habitat and diseases.

In 2016, there were 14 Amur leopard births, three of which happened in zoos across North America, according to Bullock. Nelkan, an 11-year-old male, has been paired with the zoo’s 7-year-old female Amur leopard, Jade, to boost that number.

The cats are part of the Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program developed by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums in 1981 to help ensure the survival of selected species, most of which are threatened or endangered.

The program, which protects nearly 500 species, ensures that captive populations remain genetically able to reproduce without taking animals from the wild. In this way, a captive population is bred in the event it is needed for a reintroduction program to save the species from extinction in the wild.

“Some animals only exist in captivity and more only exist in the wild because they’ve been boosted by captive bred animals,” Bullock said. “Our zoo, like many others, is much more than just a collection of animals and more important than ever.”

The Greenville Zoo, which houses an estimated 176 SSP animals, has fostered several births of threatened or endangered species since 2000. The ocelot couple Oz and Evita welcomed their second set of kittens in March. Bullock says Nelkan and Jade should produce at least one cub before 2018.

All creatures great and small

Over the past century, zoos have played a crucial role in saving hundreds of species from extinction. While most of the work has stemmed from breeding, more and more zoos are funding conservation in the field or even starting their own conservation programs. Bullock said the Greenville Zoo has spent more than $300,000 on conservation over the last seven years.

In 2010, the zoo’s conservation committee launched the Quarters for Conservation program to meet accreditation standards by creating a funding source for local and global conservation efforts.For each admission purchase, visitors receive a token representing 25 cents of their admission fee. Visitors use their tokens to vote for one of five highlighted conservation programs at a kiosk located at the zoo’s entrance.

“The conservation projects change yearly and the amount each project receives is directly related to the number of votes it receives from our zoo guests,” Bullock said.

In addition to funding from the general admission fee, the zoo allocates $3 from each annual membership fee to a fund for conservation. Each year, 50 percent of the program’s funds go directly to staff-selected projects, which currently include restoration of the Fijian crested iguana on the island of Monuriki; and efforts to help the Sumatran orangutan, Chilean flamingo, Amur leopard, and Angolan Colobus monkey.

“Quarters for Conservation gives our more than 300,000 annual visitors a way to connect with these conservation programs, and feel the power to make a difference,” Bullock said.

The program’s remaining funds are used to support grants to nonprofits, individuals, and educational entities with shared interests in conservation and research, and a small percentage is set aside for on-site conservation, research, and administration.

In 2011, the Greenville Zoo established a grant program for conservation efforts in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia that awards between $300 and $1,000 to recipients. The zoo also established a grant program for international efforts that awards up to $3,000.

The zoo has since funded more than 20 projects. It plans to award $12,910 to nine projects this year, according to Nikolay Kapustin, veterinarian and deputy zoo administrator. The request will go before Greenville City Council later this month.

Brad Lock, assistant curator of herpetology at Zoo Atlanta, has received more than $5,000 from the Greenville Zoo since 2013 to restore oak tree habitat for the critically endangered arboreal alligator lizard in central Guatemala.

“We’ve planted 60,000 trees, and it wouldn’t haven’t been possible without the Greenville Zoo’s support,” said Lock, director of Guatemalan programs for the International Reptile Conservation Foundation. “They’ve got the right attitude about conservation.”

Conservation in action

In 2008, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums estimated zoos and aquariums were spending around $252 million on conservation efforts every year, including captive breeding inside the institutions and supporting work in the field.

Some zoos are taking creative approaches to conservation, including efforts to educate the public about the plight of the world’s endangered species. For instance, the Greenville Zoo partnered with Furman University in 2014 to launch a free conservation lecture series.

The series, held periodically at the Children’s Museum in downtown Greenville, has since featured presentations about various critically endangered species ranging from Mexican gray wolves to orangutans to okapi.

“The goal is to help the public understand the importance of being responsible stewards of the planet,” said Kapustin. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a student or businessperson from downtown. We just want everyone to come out to the lectures.”

Many zoos also educate conservation workers in foreign countries or send keepers abroad to contribute their skills and knowledge to zoos and preserves helping to improve conditions and reintroductions all over the world. For instance, the Greenville Zoo has launched a scholarship program to send staff on overseas conservation missions.

Jennifer Stahl, a zookeeper, was awarded about $2,000 in 2016 to visit Malaysia’s Melaka Zoo and Night Safari. While there, she spent two weeks renovating exhibits, participating in orangutan conservation efforts, and teaching foreign handlers training techniques.

“It was an eye-opening trip, because I realized we can impact international conservation,” Stahl said. “They’re trying to protect animals from extinction like us, but they need money. Luckily, we’re able to help through our Quarters for Conservation program.”

0,"The thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus) was declared extinct in 1936. But anecdotal reports of sightings of the marsupial inspired a recent media frenzy, leading to speculation that some might still be living in the forests of northern Queensland’s Cape York Peninsula.

A biological survey conducted via camera traps had been planned for the region before news of the reported sightings spread. The aim of the survey is to find out why so many of Australia’s native marsupials – and those of Cape York in particular – are disappearing. They also hope to figure out if there are any as-yet undocumented mammals living there, such as a small, endangered rat-kangaroo called the northern bettong (Bettongia tropica).

A bettong expert says cattle ranching, invasive animals, and changing fire management regimes may be hurting native mammals in Australia.

The researchers caution that the possibility of finding evidence of thylacines living in Cape York is vanishingly small. But, if the near-impossible happens and they do manage to document some, they say news of the rediscovery likely won’t be released until protections are enacted.

The 1980s rock band Cinderella had its biggest hit with the song, “Don’t Know What You Got (Till it’s Gone),” riffing off the age-old proverb. Of course, Cinderella’s song is about a love affair, but the sentiment could speak as easily to the state of the thylacine, once the world’s largest marsupial carnivore. Representing its own family, capable of opening its mouth 80 degrees, and striped like a tiger (or maybe the tiger is striped like a thylacine), the last one died in 1936 after a decades-long campaign to wipe out the animal as sheep-killing vermin. But true to human nature, people only really began to love the thylacine after it was gone. The species has since taken on a potent afterlife by capturing the public’s imagination and inspiring thousands of reported sightings of an animal that’s supposed to be dead and gone. It has become a favorite of cryptozoologists – people who believe creatures from folklore or history are still roaming the world undocumented – and of those interested in bringing back species from the dead via their DNA.

So, it’s not exactly surprising that when a team of scientists – serious scientists with impressive careers and credentials – announced they were planning to look for thyalcines (Thylacinus cynocephalus) in Cape York Peninsula on mainland Australia the news went global and the Internet a little wild.

But the media largely failed to report some important points: the survey was planned long before the thylacine became a part of it; the sightings of the purported thylacine were more than thirty years old; the survey is taking place in mainland Australia where the thylacine is believed to have gone extinct over a thousand years ago (not Tasmania where the last known individual was shot by a hunter in 1930); and those involved are keen in tamping down any expectation of them bringing home evidence of living, breathing, extinction-defying thylacines.

“We’ve always said that we think the probability of encountering a thylacine is very, very remote,” said Bill Laurance, a professor with James Cook University well known and long respected for his work on tropical ecosystems around the world.

“People are just going batshit over this thing and the reporting made it sound as though the thylacine was practically, just waiting out there,” he added.

Laurance is working on the survey with Sandra Abell, also a professor at James Cook University and one of the world’s foremost experts on bettongs, small marsupial rat-kangaroos that are threatened with extinction – but have received zero press compared to the thylacine.

To illustrate the chances of finding actually finding thylacines, Abell pointed to a study published soon after their survey announcement that calculated the chances of a thylacine surviving: 1 in 1.6 trillion.

“So my task is huge but tongue in cheek I say challenge accepted!” Abell, who will be leading the survey on the ground, wrote in an email. “If they are there we have a good chance of getting them on camera, if they aren’t nothing is lost.”

According to the study – entitled “The thylacine is (still) extinct” – the most optimistic view is that the thylacine survived on Tasmania unrecorded until the 1950s, but then – again most optimistically – met its end.

“There are a whole set of assumptions built into models like this,” Laurance said, “but I think it interjects a needed note of sobriety.”

Laurance and Abell are not saying there is any physical evidence that thylacines survive on Cape York today; what they do say is that two sightings from the 1980s are intriguing enough to investigate. This is, after all, what scientists do: investigate.

Seeing red

Hundreds – if not thousands – of people have claimed to have seen thyalcines since their extinction, but what really got Laurance and Abell’s attention was the purported eye shine of these mystery animals.

“Eye shine is a very distinctive characteristic when an animal is looking directly at you,” explained Laurance who has done spotlighting of animals at night around the world. “Species have species-specific eye shine features and they are even age specific in some species.”

This all started in March, when Brain Hobbs, a former tourism operator, went public with a story that he saw four thylacine-like animals on Cape York – two adults and two pups – in 1983 with red eye shine.

Red is key. If indeed the animals in question had red eye shine then what Hobbs saw was probably not dingoes, dogs or feral pigs, according to Laurance and Hobbs. Known animals in the Cape York rainforest with red eye shine include Lumholtz’s tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) and the green ring-tail possum (Pseudochirops archeri), neither of which any experienced outdoors person would mistake for a thylacine.

“You got a guy who’s claiming credibly, on-the-record, both in an extended taped conversation and then later when I spoke to him at length in a very open-ended, very careful interview, who says that he’s got four individuals, twenty feet away looking straight at him. He’s dead certain, dead, dead certain, they were red eye shines,” said Laurance. “He says they are canid-sized animals and he saw distinctive lateral striping beginning from behind the front haunch going back to the backend of the animal. You know, that was when we said look.”

No one knows what color eye shine thyalcines actually had – it may not have been red. But Hobbs’ story – if true – means he wasn’t looking at an animal that researchers would most expect to be mistaken for a thylacine on Cape York.

The other sighting is from a ranger, Patrick Shears, who worked in Cape York during the 1970s and 1980s. He did not get the color of the eye shine, but he did see the animal at close range one night. He said indigenous people in the area know of it and call it the “moonlight tiger.”

Laurance said such sightings are “compelling” enough to “[make] the hair on the back of your neck stand up.”

Of course, this doesn’t mean Hobbs and Shears actually saw undead thylacines. Abell said it’s possible they were dingo-dog hybrids. Another option may be foxes. Fox can have red eye shine – and south of Cape York, thylacine sightings are often just foxes, especially those with mange, which makes them look striped like the thylacine. However, Laurance and Abell said to date there is little evidence that foxes can survive in Cape York.

“It’s just way too warm for them there – they suffer from all kinds of diseases,” Laurance explained.

Feral cats are another possibility. But Laurance said, contrary to media reports, feral cats are not that common in some parts of Australia, including Cape York.

“I’ve done a lot of field work – three years of field surveys across a lot of these different regions – and you just don’t find many feral cats,” he said, adding that he didn’t think experienced observers like Hobbs and Shears would confuse a cat for a thylacine.

“We still regard this as highly unlikely,” he cautioned. “Cops will tell you that human observers are just inherent unreliable.”

However, he added, those observers who are “the most unshakable and detailed…are the most credible.”

For Laurance, Hobbs and Shears fit this latter category.

But what they saw could still fall under any number of things. It’s possible they saw a new, undescribed species. It’s also possible that they did see thylacines, but the animals are since gone. Scientists believe that thylacines went extinct on the mainland around a millennium ago in part due to competition from bigger and more adaptable dingoes, which humans brought to Australia 4,000 years ago (there are no dingoes in Tasmanian and experts say that’s why it was able to persist there so much longer). But dingos are present on Cape York, making it harder to imagine the thylacine’s survival there. And, perhaps even more worryingly, small mammals on the peninsula are vanishing, which means that if thylacines somehow survived in this unexplored wilderness until the 1980s – they may not have been able to hold on during the last thirty years given ongoing prey decline.

But even if the team doesn’t rediscover the thylacine, it has much to discover.

Just as excited for bettongs

The primary objective of Abell and Laurance’s survey has always been to gather better data to answer the question: why are so many of Australia’s native mammals vanishing? But the thylacine news has usurped this objective, swamping out news of all the other species the researchers are looking for.

One species the team hopes to document is the northern bettong (Bettongia tropica). Currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN Red List, Abell said it’s only known from two locations, including one population she recently helped discover on Mount Spurgeon. Abell said she would be “as excited” to find the northern bettong in Cape York as the thylacine. Admittedly, she is probably alone in this sentiment, but it shows just how keen the researchers are to document any animal on the peninsula that hasn’t been cataloged yet, especially threatened ones.

Indeed, the team has a list of 74 mammal species they will be looking for on the Cape York Peninsula, some of them native and endangered and some invasive and potentially damaging to local wildlife. Whatever they find – thylacine or not – it will help them better understand what’s behind the mammal decline in northern Australia.

Researchers have put forward a number of ideas on why mammals are declining, including cattle grazing, invasive plants, drought, changes in fire regimes and predator pressure from animals like fox, cats and dingoes. Abell said that in the case of northern bettongs, she feels that habitat changes due to fire regimes and cattle grazing is key. However, she added that one possibility that that needs more exploration is disease.

What the addition of the thylacine has changed – aside from media coverage – is the intensification of the survey and some of the specific areas that will be explored.

“There are huge areas of the Cape that are still very poorly explored biologically,” Laurance said, adding that the thylacine sightings have provided a “rationale” for using helicopters to get into some of the most remote areas of the peninsula. A number of ranchers in the area employ helicopters to wrangle cattle.

Cape York is arguably the wildest place in Australia and the least explored, so if thylacines – or an undiscovered population of northern bettongs – are hiding out anywhere, it’s most likely here.

“There are weird things popping up. There’s two or three species being found every year on Cape York peninsula – new species of frogs and lizards,” Laurance said.

Heading out next month, the team plans to strategically place around 50 camera traps on the ground along with scent baits to attract carnivores. They will leave out the traps for two to four weeks before collecting them again. They also plan to do spotlighting on foot to see what they can find in person.

“[Sandra Abell] and I have both discovered or rediscovered presumed extinct populations of things, or gigantic range extensions of things,” said Laurance, adding, “new stuff is being found.”

Indeed, in 2013 wildlife photographer, John Young, got photographic evidence of the night parrot, a species in Australia that no one had confirmed since 1912. The night parrot came back from the dead after being “gone” for a longer time than the thylacine has. However, it’s also easier for a bird to stay hidden than a good-sized carnivore – and the night parrot was never officially declared extinct as credible sightings trickled in over the decades.

All this is to say, while it’s not likely the thylacine will be discovered – it’s not impossible either. After all, what would scientists have pegged the chances of a fisher pulling up from the sea a coelacanth, a fish that was supposed to have gone extinct 66 million years before?

Maybe 1 in 1.6 trillion?

Abell promised that if thyalcines are still roaming Cape York, “I will find them.”

And if they aren’t?

“I [will] still have important data that will be useful and help inform my projects on declining mammals.”

What if the unimaginable happens?

Around a thousand years ago, the thylacine was wiped out from most of mainland Australia. Victims of humans, dingoes and ongoing prey decline, most thylacine populations winked out like cities going dark. But we know that even as that happened, a population survived offshore in Tasmania for nearly a thousand years.

Now let’s say – hypothetically – a small population also survived in the wilds of Cape York.

Let’s say this Cape York population became adept at avoiding humans and dingoes; let’s say it only came out at night and stuck to well-known paths where it could hide from predators and competitors with ease; let’s say, in a sense, these animals learned to become living ghosts – this is not contrary to the literature on thylacines, which considers them nocturnal and shy. And as the peninsula filled up with cattle – as forests were felled – this small population retreated to the refugia of still-standing forests and continued, there, to hunt, to breed, to survive – unnoticed by the ever-spreading Homo sapiens.

Let’s say, however, that many aboriginal people knew this animal persisted, but held their tongues – knowing it was rare and threatened. Plus, when they talked, few outsiders believed them. Let’s say a few wilderness-lovers like Hobbs and Shears saw these animals, these thyalcines – but kept it quiet for decades because they didn’t want to be labeled as kooks (because that’s what happens when someone says they’ve seen a thylacine).

Now let’s say, against all odds, this small remnant population somehow squeezed through the last few decades – until a troupe of scientists showed up with camera traps, bait, and a local knowledge of just where these sightings occurred. Let’s say one moonlit night, a young animal, tiger-striped and pouched, walks along its silent trail until it crosses a laser that triggers the camera – and boom. Photographic proof. The thylacine is back.

Now, what the hell happens?

“Silence would be the best indicator that we actually discovered something interesting, whether it was the thylacine or something else,” Laurance said. He explained that if they got a good photo there would likely be a “government lockdown” on the news for months.

“There would be some really serious behind-the-scenes discussions and you’d probably go out and put out a bunch of hair traps to make sure you’ve got DNA samples just to verify it. And then it would be some really serious thinking about what to do about it.“

Scientists would try and answer basic questions under a veil of silence: what the thing actually is (Abell said if they do find a thylacine it would probably be a subspecies or even a different thylacine species than the one that existed in Tasmania), where exactly it occurs, and how threatened it is. Protection would come immediately.

“My first concern would be to ensure that in the short term the habitat is protected and security provided to prevent too many people trying to get access to the area,” Abell said.

Then would begin quiet negotiations with stakeholders, in this case likely indigenous groups, landowners, cattle ranchers, and maybe even mining concessions.

“My main concern is to make sure it doesn’t turn into some kind of a circus,” Laurance said.

And the end result? Both Laurance and Abell said a World Heritage Site designation could be a real possibility. And once the world knew, the region would have to figure out how to deal with a meteoric rise in people wanting to show up and have their own encounter with the moonlight tiger.

And then everyone will have to figure out how you protect a species that will suddenly become the most famous and desirable animal on the planet – overnight.

“But that’s ‘if’ built upon ‘if’ built upon ‘if’ built upon ‘if’ built upon ‘if’. There are a whole series of ‘if’s that would have to align,” cautioned Laurance, who told New Scientist that he thought the actual chances of rediscovering the thylacine were one to two percent. Not one in 1.6 trillion.

“We’re not talking about Loch Ness Monster here, we’re not talking about yetis, something that has never been documented. We’re talking about something that was known to have [existed],” he said.

If the discovery happened, it, according to Laurance, would be “world changing” in how scientists view extinction. He said it would also give the world a much-needed dose of optimism when it comes to our global mass extinction crisis, and would likely spur a frenzy searches for other supposedly vanished species.

But for all the excitement, all the hope, all the hype, all the fun what-ifs, Laurance wants to make sure people really understand that the thylacine is most likely still extinct. It’s easier, probably, to explain various sightings – even those experienced by veterans – than to assume an animal of this size survived a thousand years undocumented in Australia.

“I had this documentary guy came to my house, he said ‘what do you think the likelihood of this is?’,” Laurance said. “And I said ‘somewhere between exceedingly unlikely and vanishingly unlikely.’ And he was really disappointed. And I said, ‘well that’s just the truth. That’s the reality’. If you want to do a documentary on this you’d better make it like the Blair Witch Project because you’re probably not going to see the witch.”

In Cinderella’s song, the rock band sings, “Now I know what I got / It’s just this song.” That’s probably all we have left of the thylacine – just remnants: a few stuffed dead animals, some written accounts, our overactive imaginations. Perhaps the best lesson from all this will be that we lost the thylacine due to ignorance, greed, and cruelty – so maybe we should be doing a lot more to save other species on the edge, like the vaquita, the saola, the Hula painted frog, and the giant ibis.

But while there’s wilderness, there’s hope. Hope that every night when we go to sleep and dream, some mysterious mammals – tiger-striped and large-mawed – emerge from their dens and go hunting, their breath vanishing in the cool night air.

But anecdotal reports of sightings of the marsupial inspired a recent media frenzy, leading to speculation that some might still be living in the forests of northern Queensland’s Cape York Peninsula.

A biological survey conducted via camera traps had been planned for the region before news of the reported sightings spread. The aim of the survey is to find out why so many of Australia’s native marsupials – and those of Cape York in particular – are disappearing. They also hope to figure out if there are any as-yet undocumented mammals living there, such as a small, endangered rat-kangaroo called the northern bettong (Bettongia tropica).

A bettong expert says cattle ranching, invasive animals, and changing fire management regimes may be hurting native mammals in Australia.

The researchers caution that the possibility of finding evidence of thylacines living in Cape York is vanishingly small. But, if the near-impossible happens and they do manage to document some, they say news of the rediscovery likely won’t be released until protections are enacted.

The 1980s rock band Cinderella had its biggest hit with the song, “Don’t Know What You Got (Till it’s Gone),” riffing off the age-old proverb. Of course, Cinderella’s song is about a love affair, but the sentiment could speak as easily to the state of the thylacine, once the world’s largest marsupial carnivore. Representing its own family, capable of opening its mouth 80 degrees, and striped like a tiger (or maybe the tiger is striped like a thylacine), the last one died in 1936 after a decades-long campaign to wipe out the animal as sheep-killing vermin. But true to human nature, people only really began to love the thylacine after it was gone. The species has since taken on a potent afterlife by capturing the public’s imagination and inspiring thousands of reported sightings of an animal that’s supposed to be dead and gone. It has become a favorite of cryptozoologists – people who believe creatures from folklore or history are still roaming the world undocumented – and of those interested in bringing back species from the dead via their DNA.

So, it’s not exactly surprising that when a team of scientists – serious scientists with impressive careers and credentials – announced they were planning to look for thyalcines (Thylacinus cynocephalus) in Cape York Peninsula on mainland Australia the news went global and the Internet a little wild.

But the media largely failed to report some important points: the survey was planned long before the thylacine became a part of it; the sightings of the purported thylacine were more than thirty years old; the survey is taking place in mainland Australia where the thylacine is believed to have gone extinct over a thousand years ago (not Tasmania where the last known individual was shot by a hunter in 1930); and those involved are keen in tamping down any expectation of them bringing home evidence of living, breathing, extinction-defying thylacines.

“We’ve always said that we think the probability of encountering a thylacine is very, very remote,” said Bill Laurance, a professor with James Cook University well known and long respected for his work on tropical ecosystems around the world.

“People are just going batshit over this thing and the reporting made it sound as though the thylacine was practically, just waiting out there,” he added.

Laurance is working on the survey with Sandra Abell, also a professor at James Cook University and one of the world’s foremost experts on bettongs, small marsupial rat-kangaroos that are threatened with extinction – but have received zero press compared to the thylacine.

To illustrate the chances of finding actually finding thylacines, Abell pointed to a study published soon after their survey announcement that calculated the chances of a thylacine surviving: 1 in 1.6 trillion.

“So my task is huge but tongue in cheek I say challenge accepted!” Abell, who will be leading the survey on the ground, wrote in an email. “If they are there we have a good chance of getting them on camera, if they aren’t nothing is lost.”

According to the study – entitled “The thylacine is (still) extinct” – the most optimistic view is that the thylacine survived on Tasmania unrecorded until the 1950s, but then – again most optimistically – met its end.

“There are a whole set of assumptions built into models like this,” Laurance said, “but I think it interjects a needed note of sobriety.”

Laurance and Abell are not saying there is any physical evidence that thylacines survive on Cape York today; what they do say is that two sightings from the 1980s are intriguing enough to investigate. This is, after all, what scientists do: investigate.

Seeing red

Hundreds – if not thousands – of people have claimed to have seen thyalcines since their extinction, but what really got Laurance and Abell’s attention was the purported eye shine of these mystery animals.

“Eye shine is a very distinctive characteristic when an animal is looking directly at you,” explained Laurance who has done spotlighting of animals at night around the world. “Species have species-specific eye shine features and they are even age specific in some species.”

This all started in March, when Brain Hobbs, a former tourism operator, went public with a story that he saw four thylacine-like animals on Cape York – two adults and two pups – in 1983 with red eye shine.

Red is key. If indeed the animals in question had red eye shine then what Hobbs saw was probably not dingoes, dogs or feral pigs, according to Laurance and Hobbs. Known animals in the Cape York rainforest with red eye shine include Lumholtz’s tree kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi) and the green ring-tail possum (Pseudochirops archeri), neither of which any experienced outdoors person would mistake for a thylacine.

“You got a guy who’s claiming credibly, on-the-record, both in an extended taped conversation and then later when I spoke to him at length in a very open-ended, very careful interview, who says that he’s got four individuals, twenty feet away looking straight at him. He’s dead certain, dead, dead certain, they were red eye shines,” said Laurance. “He says they are canid-sized animals and he saw distinctive lateral striping beginning from behind the front haunch going back to the backend of the animal. You know, that was when we said look.”

No one knows what color eye shine thyalcines actually had – it may not have been red. But Hobbs’ story – if true – means he wasn’t looking at an animal that researchers would most expect to be mistaken for a thylacine on Cape York.

The other sighting is from a ranger, Patrick Shears, who worked in Cape York during the 1970s and 1980s. He did not get the color of the eye shine, but he did see the animal at close range one night. He said indigenous people in the area know of it and call it the “moonlight tiger.”

Laurance said such sightings are “compelling” enough to “[make] the hair on the back of your neck stand up.”

Of course, this doesn’t mean Hobbs and Shears actually saw undead thylacines. Abell said it’s possible they were dingo-dog hybrids. Another option may be foxes. Fox can have red eye shine – and south of Cape York, thylacine sightings are often just foxes, especially those with mange, which makes them look striped like the thylacine. However, Laurance and Abell said to date there is little evidence that foxes can survive in Cape York.

“It’s just way too warm for them there – they suffer from all kinds of diseases,” Laurance explained.

Feral cats are another possibility. But Laurance said, contrary to media reports, feral cats are not that common in some parts of Australia, including Cape York.

“I’ve done a lot of field work – three years of field surveys across a lot of these different regions – and you just don’t find many feral cats,” he said, adding that he didn’t think experienced observers like Hobbs and Shears would confuse a cat for a thylacine.

“We still regard this as highly unlikely,” he cautioned. “Cops will tell you that human observers are just inherent unreliable.”

However, he added, those observers who are “the most unshakable and detailed…are the most credible.”

For Laurance, Hobbs and Shears fit this latter category.

But what they saw could still fall under any number of things. It’s possible they saw a new, undescribed species. It’s also possible that they did see thylacines, but the animals are since gone. Scientists believe that thylacines went extinct on the mainland around a millennium ago in part due to competition from bigger and more adaptable dingoes, which humans brought to Australia 4,000 years ago (there are no dingoes in Tasmanian and experts say that’s why it was able to persist there so much longer). But dingos are present on Cape York, making it harder to imagine the thylacine’s survival there. And, perhaps even more worryingly, small mammals on the peninsula are vanishing, which means that if thylacines somehow survived in this unexplored wilderness until the 1980s – they may not have been able to hold on during the last thirty years given ongoing prey decline.

But even if the team doesn’t rediscover the thylacine, it has much to discover.

Just as excited for bettongs

The primary objective of Abell and Laurance’s survey has always been to gather better data to answer the question: why are so many of Australia’s native mammals vanishing? But the thylacine news has usurped this objective, swamping out news of all the other species the researchers are looking for.

The revolt led by the Ulama of India in 1857 & the Ulama of CVE in 2017

“The scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets.”[1]

160 years ago, in this very month of May, a significant world event took place. The Indian Revolt of 1857-58 was a major uprising in India against the rule of the occupying British East India Company which functioned as a sovereign power on behalf of the British Crown.

The revolt is known by many names, including the Sepoy Mutiny, the Indian Mutiny, the Great Rebellion, the Revolt of 1857 and the Indian Insurrection.

Resistance against British occupation began much earlier with the likes of Tipu Sultan and his father in Mysore between 1767-1799. In 1803, the son of Shah Waliullah, Abdul Aziz Shah, declared the first fatwa (edict) calling for armed Jihād against the occupying forces which was then taken on by his friend and student, Sayyid Ahmed Brelwi (1786-1831). Nevertheless, the uprising in 1857 is regarded as India’s First War of Independence because of its having spread nationally and not restricted to just certain provinces as previous revolts had been.

Background

While the British East India Company had established a presence in India for “trading purposes” as far back as 1612, its victory in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of its firm foothold in India.

The revolt of 1857 came about as a result of a number of factors relating to the mistreatment and oppression inflicted upon both Muslims and Hindus in India by the British. The Sepoys, who were local Muslim and Hindu soldiers, were recruited into the East India Company’s army. In line with the colonialist policy, Christian missionaries were exported to states occupied by the British to promote the “British Values” of its time, vis-à-vis ‘Christianity’, as was also the case in Africa as part of its global crusade to “Christianise” the world. A famous saying, often attributed to the African social activist and Kenya’s first Prime Minister (1963-1964) Jomo Kenyatta, comes to mind in highlighting this issue:

“When the Missionaries arrived, the Africans had their land and the Missionaries had the bible. They taught us how to pray with our eyes closed. When we opened them, they had our land and we had the Bible.”[2]

Although the missionaries were active in India right from the outset, by 1857 many Sepoy soldiers were convinced that the East India Company was masterminding mass conversions of Muslims and Hindus to Christianity.[3] The level of British oppression crossed the limit of tolerance when new ammunition cartridges for rifles were issued. The new cartridges were made out of paper and pre-greased.[4] To access the powder from the cartridges, the Sepoys were instructed to bite it open. However, there was a sinister purpose to this, it was widely reported that the grease used was sourced from beef and pork fat, thereby intentionally setting out to insult and offend both Hindus and Muslims respectively.

It was clear to the imperialists that some sort of rebellion over the cartridges was imminent. During April 1857, there was unrest and fires at Agra, Allahabad and Ambala. The spark, however, that would light the flames of resistance came from Meerut when some Sepoys refused the cartridges and were publicly humiliated and imprisoned with heavy sentences. On 10 May 1857, a group of Sepoys attacked and freed their brethren from prison. The Sepoys and those civilians who joined their cause escaped and made their way to the ancient capital and the then present seat of the Mughal Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, who was in Delhi. The growing resistance force petitioned Bahadur Shah Zafar to lead them against the imperialists, which he eventually and reluctantly accepted.[5] Despite having significant loss of power from preceding centuries, the Mughal name still carried great prestige in the hearts of the Muslims. The British underestimated this and were oblivious to just how many were willing to rally under the Mughal banner.

However, what aided the cause significantly and tipped the balance were the noble Ulama of India. For the first time since the edict issued by Abdul Aziz Shah another edict for armed Jihād was issued. This carried the signature of thirty-four Ulama of the highest eminence. Prominent among them were great luminaries such as Maulana Qasim Nanotawi, who later became one of the founders of the prestigious Dār al-ʿUlūm Deoband, Maulana Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi and Hafiz Zamin Shaheed who fought the imperial army under the leadership of Haji lmdadullah at Shamli Field.[6] The people were moved when they saw that their Ulama were at the forefront in showing resistance to the occupying forces. The mood of retaliation against the supercilious British dominance had extended right across India. The Ulama had inspired the civilian population to rise up.

For the British colonialists, the revolt posed a considerable threat to their power, and was contained only with the defeat suffered by the mujāhidīn in Gwalior on 20 June 1858. Although the resistance, which was being fought and spiritually led by the Ulama, made many gains early on, in the end the barbarity of the British in suppressing the uprising was unprecedented and their superior weaponry and brutality in defending their hegemony proved too much for the brave Muslims. Perhaps most damning of all was the role played by those Muslims who sided with the British imperialists in bringing the revolt to an end. Lord Canning (then Governor General) commented on one particular Indian Prince, saying: “If (he) joins the rebels, I will pack off tomorrow”. Later he was to comment:

“The Princes acted as the breakwaters to the storm which otherwise would have swept us in one great wave.”[7]

The Ulama became the main target of the British oppression and persecution. The word ‘Maulvi’ became synonymous with ‘rebel’ in British eyes. At least 100,000 were killed of which a great proportion were the Ulama.[8] Right across India, in the Punjab, Ambala, Multan, Peshawar, Agra, Jhelum, Aurangabad and many other places, “mutineers” were tied to the barrels of cannons and blown away whilst others were hanged.

The lengthy Mughal dynasty now came to an end. Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar was exiled to Burma in 1858 while his three sons were executed. Bahadur Shah Zafar died four years later in Rangoon, aged 87.

The rebellion proved to be an important watershed in Indian and British Empire history and led to the dissolution of the East India Company. The Government of India Act 1858 meant that India was now to be administered directly by the British government in the new

Points to Note

The Ulama that were involved in the 1857 revolt knew very well the consequences of their actions, however they were driven by the Islamic teachings in enjoining what is good by standing up for justice, and repelling what is evil by fighting oppression and tyranny. Their objective was to replace the corrupt, imperialist administration by establishing a government based on principles of equality and justice.

The ḥadīth “the scholars are the inheritors of the Prophets” is often regarded as being about knowledge only, but what is knowledge if it does not transform a person’s outward action? Knowledge and action go hand in hand and are often mentioned together in various verses in the Qur’ān.

An interesting point that followed the revolts were the cases brought against many Ulama. The sedition cases were generally known as ‘the Wahabi Cases’ or the ‘Ambala Conspiracy Case’. What is of note is that while many Muslims today divide themselves based on their Aqīdah (Creed), it makes no difference to our detractors. For the British imperialists it did not matter what the Aqīdah of those Ulama in India actually was; for them, they were all the same—an obstacle to their continued oppressive hegemony. The pejorative “Wahabi” used against them entered into the British imagination and is recycled by some even until today.

Unfortunately, some “Ulama” today are involved in programmes and actions that make them stand on the wrong side of justice and history. Many are involved in the misnamed global Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programmes and, in doing so, provide tacit approval for the crimes of oppressive regimes across the world suppressing popular grassroots movements for self-determination. Some have gone to considerable lengths to demonise non-violent activists and groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood, supporting the likes of Sisi’s “deformation of Islām” project.[9] There have even been recent reports of concern from Egypt of Muslim scholars being arrested for holding harmless, mainstream beliefs, such as that Christians are disbelievers in Islām.[10] In India some sectarian “Ulama” have even supported India’s extreme Hindu nationalist government’s decision to ludicrously place Peace TV founder Dr Zakir Naik on an Interpol list![11]

In the UK we have some self-styled “Ulama” and “Imams” being used as proponents of our equivalent of CVE, PREVENT, albeit shrinking in number as the toxicity of the policy is better and better known. Though no one will argue that there is anything wrong in wanting to prevent actual violence, CVE programmes such as PREVENT fit into an ideological construct which sees too much ‘Muslim-ness’ as a threat to the public or to “Western” liberal values and, therefore, equates religious conservatism with violent extremism. As such, normative Islamic beliefs and concepts seen through the lens of national security and thus criminalised in a pre-crime space, with the aim of creating a state-approved, diluted and obedient version of Islām that coincidentally shields oppressive regimes from criticism and condemnation.

Perhaps some Ulama involved in these programmes believe that they are preserving their Islamic organisations and institutions. To these scholars, I say that history is indeed a wonderful teacher if only people took note. When we look at the example of Muslim Spain, we see that the Nasrids in Granada also believed in saving themselves at the expense of helping their brethren. For nearly 200 years, Granada was the last Muslim “stronghold” ruled by the Nasrids as a vassal state of Christian kingdoms until 1492 when Granada was taken. Muslims paid a yearly tribute to the Christians in order to remain in Granada. The first of the Nasrid rulers Muhammad I accepted King Fernando III of Castile as his sovereign and in 1248 helped him, as his vassal, against his fellow Muslims to conquer Seville as well as other Muslim cities.[12] Despite the odd conflict, successive Nasirid rulers by and large collaborated with the Christians to suppress Muslim “rebels” as part of the “Countering Violent Extremism” policy of that time. While their Christian overlords allowed them to continue to survive and build in the end the result of joining hands with them against their own brethren was total devastation. When the Nasrids were of no further use to the Christian kings they were removed and the ensuing inquisition, torture, mass conversions and expulsions which followed completely eliminated Muslims from the face of the Iberian Peninsula.

It is a sad indictment that the great legacy of the noble Ulama of India’s freedom struggle is today tainted by a minority of those who claim to be their “heirs” who, rather than resisting, work hand in hand with those committing injustice. What is the price they are being asked to pay? For the Ulama of 1857, they paid the ultimate price with their life. However the Ulama here today are simply being asked to reject these discriminatory and unjust policies without threat to life or limb, for most of them.

The noble Ulama who fought colonialists are not only seen as heroes by Muslims, but even their foes recognised them as such. The British Army General, Sir Mowbray Thompson, who fought against Muslims in the uprisings of 1857, wrote in his memoir:

“If to fight for one’s country, plan and mastermind wars against mighty occupying powers are (acts of) patriotism, then undoubtedly the maulvis (i.e. the Ulama) were the loyal patriots of their country and their succeeding generations will remember them as heroes.”

As for the Ulama of the CVE programmes, unless they change tact, rather than being seen as heroes, they will be remembered more like the Abū Raghāls of their time.[13]

In the UK we have some self-styled “Ulama” and “Imams” being used as proponents of our equivalent of CVE, PREVENT, albeit shrinking in number as the toxicity of the policy is better and better known. Though no one will argue that there is anything wrong in wanting to prevent actual violence, CVE programmes such as PREVENT fit into an ideological construct which sees too much ‘Muslim-ness’ as a threat to the public or to “Western” liberal values and, therefore, equates religious conservatism with violent extremism. As such, normative Islamic beliefs and concepts seen through the lens of national security and thus criminalised in a pre-crime space, with the aim of creating a state-approved, diluted and obedient version of Islām that coincidentally shields oppressive regimes from criticism and condemnation.

Perhaps some Ulama involved in these programmes believe that they are preserving their Islamic organisations and institutions. To these scholars, I say that history is indeed a wonderful teacher if only people took note. When we look at the example of Muslim Spain, we see that the Nasrids in Granada also believed in saving themselves at the expense of helping their brethren. For nearly 200 years, Granada was the last Muslim “stronghold” ruled by the Nasrids as a vassal state of Christian kingdoms until 1492 when Granada was taken. Muslims paid a yearly tribute to the Christians in order to remain in Granada. The first of the Nasrid rulers Muhammad I accepted King Fernando III of Castile as his sovereign and in 1248 helped him, as his vassal, against his fellow Muslims to conquer Seville as well as other Muslim cities.[12] Despite the odd conflict, successive Nasirid rulers by and large collaborated with the Christians to suppress Muslim “rebels” as part of the “Countering Violent Extremism” policy of that time. While their Christian overlords allowed them to continue to survive and build in the end the result of joining hands with them against their own brethren was total devastation. When the Nasrids were of no further use to the Christian kings they were removed and the ensuing inquisition, torture, mass conversions and expulsions which followed completely eliminated Muslims from the face of the Iberian Peninsula.

It is a sad indictment that the great legacy of the noble Ulama of India’s freedom struggle is today tainted by a minority of those who claim to be their “heirs” who, rather than resisting, work hand in hand with those committing injustice. What is the price they are being asked to pay? For the Ulama of 1857, they paid the ultimate price with their life. However the Ulama here today are simply being asked to reject these discriminatory and unjust policies without threat to life or limb, for most of them.

The noble Ulama who fought colonialists are not only seen as heroes by Muslims, but even their foes recognised them as such. The British Army General, Sir Mowbray Thompson, who fought against Muslims in the uprisings of 1857, wrote in his memoir:

“If to fight for one’s country, plan and mastermind wars against mighty occupying powers are (acts of) patriotism, then undoubtedly the maulvis (i.e. the Ulama) were the loyal patriots of their country and their succeeding generations will remember them as heroes.”

As for the Ulama of the CVE programmes, unless they change tact, rather than being seen as heroes, they will be remembered more like the Abū Raghāls of their time.[13]

[13] Abū Raghāl: In the year of the Prophet’s (sall Allāhu ʿalayhi wa sallam) birth the army of Abraha descended on Makkah. Abraha was a Christian ruler in Yemen who had built a big church, al-Qullays. He sought to destroy the Ka’ba in Makkah, making al-Qullays the centre of worship and trade for all of Arabia. To do this, he set out to destroy the Ka’ba and eliminate any opposition. In order to do this, however, he needed a guide to lead his army for the best route to Makkah. A man called Abū Raghāl from the city of Tā’if agreed to be the guide against his own people and against his co-religionists for a lowly wage. As the army of Abraha got to the gates of Makkah, Abū Raghāl died and the army of Abraha was destroyed. The Arabs of that time would often curse the grave of Abū Raghāl for being a traitor to his own people and to his own religion for mere dinars. Treachery is such a heinous crime that Abū Raghāl’s name has been immortalised on account of this lowly act.","[{'DATE', 'Ramadan'}, {'the Ulama of India', 'ORG'}, {'1857', 'DATE'}, {'DATE', '2017'},

0,"The Greenville Zoo plans to donate $12,910, which was raised through its Quarters for Conservation program, to nine local and international conservation projects.

These projects will receive funding from the zoo:

Greenville’s Lake Conestee Nature Park will receive $910 to monitor native reptiles and amphibians.

Clemson University researcher Jill Newman will receive $1,000 to continue her work to understand the state’s green salamander population, and model the species’ vulnerability to anticipated climate change.

The Georgia Sea Turtle Center will receive $3,000 to assess the impacts of climate change and habitat quality on the ecology of rattlesnakes.

The International Reptile Conservation Foundation will receive $3,000 to restore oak tree habitat for the critically endangered arboreal alligator lizard in central Guatemala.

Save Our Saluda, a citizens group that works to protect and restore water resources in the Saluda Watershed, will receive $1,000 to create an interactive map of the Upper Saluda Watershed.

Coral Reef CPR will receive $1,000 to further assess the conservation status of endangered reef sharks in the Maldives.

Virginia Technical College researcher Brandon Semel will receive $1,000 to help develop conservation efforts for Madagascar’s lemurs.

Creature Conserve will receive $1,000 to monitor giant otter populations at the Karanambu Lodge in Guyana during the dry season.

People, Lions, and the Environment will receive $1,000 to stop illegal lion killings around protected areas in western Tanzania.

Jeff Bullock, Greenville Zoo administrator, said the zoo has collected more than $100,000 in the last three years through its Quarters for Conservation program.

“Quarters for Conservation gives our more than 300,000 annual visitors a way to connect with these conservation programs,” he said.

In 2010, the zoo launched the program to meet accreditation standards by creating a funding source for local and global conservation efforts. For each admission purchase, visitors receive a token representing 25 cents of their admission fee. Visitors use their tokens to vote for one of five highlighted conservation programs at a kiosk located at the zoo’s entrance.

In addition to funding from the general admission fee, the zoo allocates $3 from each annual membership fee to a restricted fund for conservation.

“The conservation projects change yearly and the amount each project receives is directly related to the number of votes it receives from our zoo guests,” Bullock said.

Each year, 50 percent of the program’s funds go to the kiosk projects, which include the restoration of the Fijian crested iguana on the island of Monuriki and efforts to help the Sumatran orangutan, Chilean flamingo, Amur leopard, and Angolan Colobus monkey.

Those funds will go before City Council later this year, according to Bullock.

The remaining funds are used to support grants to nonprofits, individuals, and educational entities with shared interests in conservation, and a small percentage is set aside for on-site conservation, research, and administration.

The zoo has since funded more than 20 conservation projects across the globe.

We have perhaps the smallest pub in the world and the world’s biggest’ fish and chip restaurant.

The Cleethorpes seafront is flanked by Victorian gardens and what appears to be a castle is in fact a Victorian folly. Two WW1 forts, Forts Haile Sand and Bull Sand, still stand guard in the estuary.

An abundance of wild birds, a leisure centre and the wild open space of the unique Humberston Fitties.

Visitors will tell you their many reasons why they keep coming back to our resort, so maybe we residents need reminding why Cleethorpes is the best.

So here's 10 things about Cleethorpes to be proud of.

1. The Prom

From a snooze in a deck chair or a stroll along the prom to a donkey ride or a paddle in the tide, Cleethorpes beach ticks all those boxes for a great family day out, even if you end up with sandy toes and salty kisses! And although now a fish and chip restaurant you can still stroll along the Cleethorpes Pier. It originally cost £8,000 to build and was officially opened on August Bank Holiday Monday 1873.

2. The Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway

Catch a ride on the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway 15 in gauge trains. It's the No.1 tourist attraction in North East Lincolnshire as voted by visitors on Tripadvisor. Established in 1948, the award-winning Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway has been delighting old and young visitors alike for generations. Sit back and enjoy a four mile return journey along the Humberside coast on one of Britain’s oldest seaside miniature railways. And relax with a refreshing pint or two in The Signal Box Inn – the smallest pub on the planet. Or why not try Platform One Café, serving delicious breakfasts, light lunches and refreshments.

3: The boating lake

Catch some greenery at the Cleethorpes Boating Lake. Stroll around the lake, feed the resident ducks or take a pedalo or rowing boat on the water. Great for families, there's a sandy pit and paddling pool and don't forget the Discovery Centre, with exhibitions, a gift shop and a wonderful cafe.

4. The Jungle Zoo

It's a jungle out there and it certainly is at the Jungle Zoo. Whatever the weather or your age, you'll be fascinated by the well loved and well cared for animals cared by owners, Sharon and Craig Gledhill and their team. From snakes and meerkats to monkeys, goats and talking parrots and watch out for Rhino, the Rhinoceros Iguana wandering around, if only we could talk to the animals!

5. The Country Park

For even wider green space go to the Cleethorpes Country Park. It’s an oasis in the middle of town, this 160-acre park was formed in 1988 and has a seven-acre lake. With footpaths and a cycle lane, it even has a dogs swimming pool and a car park.

6. The cinema

Entertainment on the big screen comes in the form a nine-screen cinema complex at the Parkway Cinema. With the latest mainstream releases, special sessions for toddlers, parents with babies, and a senior screen, there is also a bar and coffee shop area. Also showing live shows, plays and a regular comedy store.

7. Fish and chip shops

Well what can we say, who doesn't like fish and chips which is just as well as we have an abundance of them, serving the freshest of fish. Everyone has their favourites, but we now have Pappa's on the Pier, talk about a meal with a view! And you only have to look at the long queues of people outside the likes of The Ocean Fish Bar or Steels Corner house to know Cleethorpes serves only the best!

8. Shopping

Shopping in Cleethorpes is quite an experience from the Wednesday and Saturday outdoor markets to independent shops in Sea View Street to the high street stores in the 'avenue'. Sea View streets also offers an eating and shopping experience to savour from Marples, the Notts Pub, Tillets, Daniella Draper Jewellery, Lost Boys and are just a few of the unique shops, from quality boutiques you will find that unique purchase and there's always something for those bargain hunters.

9. Bistros, restaurants and tearooms.

All that fresh sea air does make you hungry so that must be why Cleethorpes also has an abundance of eateries. From French cuisine and Italian food to Indian, Chinese, tapas, afternoon tea to the traditional cafes serving food all day. For an eating experience second to none, get your taste buds around Petite Delight, the new Nala on the Kingsway, a fine dining family run restaurant, Figs on Alexandra Road, Tale of Two offering first class tapas, to the cool new Copper, Society and People Bar and Kitchen bar.

10. Free entertainment

Nowhere else will you find such free quality entertainment at many different venues in town. From the Kingsway Kiosks with their decade-themed music weekends, to reliving that wartime camaraderie, just take a seat by the seaside, chill out and enjoy. The Cleethorpes Light Railway with their Folk and Cider weekend, 1940s weekend and the Rail Ale and Blues Festival all feature free entertainment. Many pubs host free live performances including 0'North, The Moon on the Water, and Mucky Muldoons. And don't forget to look out for the next Sound of Cleethorpes event featuring, our local talented musicians who perform at many different venues for free.

But don’t take our word for it, get out there, taste, feel and experience what Cleethorpes is all about.",10 reasons why Cleethorpes is the best place when the sun is out,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdyaW1zYnl0ZWxlZ3JhcGguY28udWsvd2hhdHMtb24vZmFtaWx5LWtpZHMvc2FuZHktdG9lcy1zYWx0eS1raXNzZXMtZmlzaC0xMTMyODLSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5ncmltc2J5dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL3doYXRzLW9uL2ZhbWlseS1raWRzL3NhbmR5LXRvZXMtc2FsdHkta2lzc2VzLWZpc2gtMTEzMjgyLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i2-prod.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/cleethorpes-people/article113606.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/10thingskids.jpg,2017-06-20,"{'sent': 'Sign up to FREE email alerts from GrimsbyLive - Daily Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice', 'ents': {'ORG': ['GrimsbyLive - Daily Subscribe']}}","Sign up to FREE email alerts from GrimsbyLive - Daily Subscribe Thank you for subscribing See our privacy notice Invalid Email

We have perhaps the smallest pub in the world and the world’s biggest’ fish and chip restaurant.

The Cleethorpes seafront is flanked by Victorian gardens and what appears to be a castle is in fact a Victorian folly. Two WW1 forts, Forts Haile Sand and Bull Sand, still stand guard in the estuary.

An abundance of wild birds, a leisure centre and the wild open space of the unique Humberston Fitties.

Visitors will tell you their many reasons why they keep coming back to our resort, so maybe we residents need reminding why Cleethorpes is the best.

So here's 10 things about Cleethorpes to be proud of.

1. The Prom

From a snooze in a deck chair or a stroll along the prom to a donkey ride or a paddle in the tide, Cleethorpes beach ticks all those boxes for a great family day out, even if you end up with sandy toes and salty kisses! And although now a fish and chip restaurant you can still stroll along the Cleethorpes Pier. It originally cost £8,000 to build and was officially opened on August Bank Holiday Monday 1873.

2. The Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway

Catch a ride on the Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway 15 in gauge trains. It's the No.1 tourist attraction in North East Lincolnshire as voted by visitors on Tripadvisor. Established in 1948, the award-winning Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway has been delighting old and young visitors alike for generations. Sit back and enjoy a four mile return journey along the Humberside coast on one of Britain’s oldest seaside miniature railways. And relax with a refreshing pint or two in The Signal Box Inn – the smallest pub on the planet. Or why not try Platform One Café, serving delicious breakfasts, light lunches and refreshments.

3: The boating lake

Catch some greenery at the Cleethorpes Boating Lake. Stroll around the lake, feed the resident ducks or take a pedalo or rowing boat on the water. Great for families, there's a sandy pit and paddling pool and don't forget the Discovery Centre, with exhibitions, a gift shop and a wonderful cafe.

4. The Jungle Zoo

It's a jungle out there and it certainly is at the Jungle Zoo. Whatever the weather or your age, you'll be fascinated by the well loved and well cared for animals cared by owners, Sharon and Craig Gledhill and their team. From snakes and meerkats to monkeys, goats and talking parrots and watch out for Rhino, the Rhinoceros Iguana wandering around, if only we could talk to the animals!

5. The Country Park

For even wider green space go to the Cleethorpes Country Park. It’s an oasis in the middle of town, this 160-acre park was formed in 1988 and has a seven-acre lake. With footpaths and a cycle lane, it even has a dogs swimming pool and a car park.

6. The cinema

Entertainment on the big screen comes in the form a nine-screen cinema complex at the Parkway Cinema. With the latest mainstream releases, special sessions for toddlers, parents with babies, and a senior screen, there is also a bar and coffee shop area. Also showing live shows, plays and a regular comedy store.

7. Fish and chip shops

Well what can we say, who doesn't like fish and chips which is just as well as we have an abundance of them, serving the freshest of fish. Everyone has their favourites, but we now have Pappa's on the Pier, talk about a meal with a view! And you only have to look at the long queues of people outside the likes of The Ocean Fish Bar or Steels Corner house to know Cleethorpes serves only the best!

8. Shopping

Shopping in Cleethorpes is quite an experience from the Wednesday and Saturday outdoor markets to independent shops in Sea View Street to the high street stores in the 'avenue'. Sea View streets also offers an eating and shopping experience to savour from Marples, the Notts Pub, Tillets, Daniella Draper Jewellery, Lost Boys and are just a few of the unique shops, from quality boutiques you will find that unique purchase and there's always something for those bargain hunters.

9. Bistros, restaurants and tearooms.

All that fresh sea air does make you hungry so that must be why Cleethorpes also has an abundance of eateries. From French cuisine and Italian food to Indian, Chinese, tapas, afternoon tea to the traditional cafes serving food all day. For an eating experience second to none, get your taste buds around Petite Delight, the new Nala on the Kingsway, a fine dining family run restaurant, Figs on Alexandra Road, Tale of Two offering first class tapas, to the cool new Copper, Society and People Bar and Kitchen bar.

10. Free entertainment

Nowhere else will you find such free quality entertainment at many different venues in town. From the Kingsway Kiosks with their decade-themed music weekends, to reliving that wartime camaraderie, just take a seat by the seaside, chill out and enjoy. The Cleethorpes Light Railway with their Folk and Cider weekend, 1940s weekend and the Rail Ale and Blues Festival all feature free entertainment. Many pubs host free live performances including 0'North, The Moon on the Water, and Mucky Muldoons. And don't forget to look out for the next Sound of Cleethorpes event featuring, our local talented musicians who perform at many different venues for free.

0,"The unusually long, oval egg of the Indonesian maleo may look a lot like a potato, but this bird is no slouch.

When the chicks of these anvil-headed animals hatch, they're almost immediately able to fly.

For years, scientists have wondered why bird species have different egg shapes. Some theorized shapes may protect eggs from shattering or allow them to fit snugly in the nest. Aristotle had even (wrongly) asserted that long, pointy eggs were female while rounder eggs were male.

But no comprehensive studies had ever been conducted to test these ideas, which left Mary Stoddard and colleagues skeptical.

“It has not gone unnoticed that birds have evolved to shapes that are quite diverse in form—everything from a spherical owl egg to a pointy sandpiper egg,” said Stoddard, an ecologist at Princeton University. (Read more about the secrets of evolution in National Geographic magazine.)

In a new study, the team revealed a surprise: Egg shapes evolved as birds themselves evolved for better flight.

View Images Various bird eggs are shown in a still-life portrait. Eggs vary greatly in size and shape. Photograph by Frans Lanting, Nat Geo Image Collection

Taking Flight

First, the scientists had to discover a way to classify eggs in terms of their shape. They focused on two factors: the asymmetry and ellipticity—or ovalness—of an egg.

The team came up with mathematical formulas to describe almost 50,000 eggs from 1,400 species, plotting their shapes on a graph. (Take National Geographic's backyard bird quiz.)

The most oval egg? The maleo. The least sandpiper claimed the title of the most asymmetric egg, thanks to its characteristic pointy tip, according to the study, published this week in the journal Science.

View Images The eggs of a modern ostrich and an extinct elephant bird (left) contrast with a tiny, jellybean-size hummingbird egg. Photograph by Frans Lanting, Nat Geo Image Collection

The researchers then examined whether birds that lay eggs of a certain shape have common diets, nests, and anatomy.

For instance, they analyzed the birds' hand-wing index, a formula that describes a bird’s flight style and efficiency, as well as its ability to migrate from its birth site.

The results showed that birds with the higher hand-wing index—the most efficient and thus best fliers—were the ones with the most asymmetric or elliptical eggs. (Read about the big bang in bird evolution.)

“We were shocked to see that one of the best explanations for egg shape variation was flight ability,” says Stoddard.

“This is something that has not gotten a lot of airtime in the hypotheses that are out there for egg shape variation.”

Dinosaur Clues

This could mean that as a bird's body evolved for better flight, the shape of its egg might have adapted with it.

Stoddard doesn't know why certain shapes correlate to better flying, but she suspects it has to do with properties of the egg membrane, which are more responsible for an egg’s shape than the shell.

The maleo, for example, may have evolved to become a skillful flier, and its egg might have evolved its long, oval shape to accommodate a streamlined body built for instantaneous flight.

Researchers have found that even two-legged predatory dinosaurs called theropods—from which birds evolved—had pointy eggs. (See ""Birds Evolved From Dinosaurs Slowly—Then Took Off."")

“It’s really useful information about nature that up until now has been patchy,” said Claire Spottiswoode, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Cambridge, who wrote a summary of the study.

“It’s also exciting because it inspires a lot of new questions too.”

The Penguin Exception

Based on the team’s theory, one might assume that all flightless birds would have perfectly round and symmetrical eggs. Ostriches have round eggs, for instance.

Ostrich Eggs

However, penguins have pointy eggs associated with well-flying birds. Their working hypothesis is that penguins might have adapted for powerful underwater flight, Stoddard says.

Officials at the Hyogo Park of the Oriental White Stork in Toyooka, Japan have just announced the release of a recently-raised white stork, making it the 100th white stork living free in the wild today.

Conservationists first announced the 12-year milestone on Monday.

The species in Japan became extinct in 1971, due to the city’s fast economic expansion, but after receiving six chicks from Russia in 1985 the facility began breeding the storks in captivity. In 2005, the conservation center began releasing the storks into the wild.

“I couldn’t be happier and hopefully they will continue flying in the skies all over the country and make other people happy too,” Satoshi Yamagishi, chief of the facility, told Japan Today.

By using eyewitness reports and tracking data, the facility is currently keeping a close eye on how the storks are faring in the local wild. However, the great white birds, which have a wing span of up to 7 feet, can reportedly still be found in China and Russia.

Nature renews itself, going from times of stagnation and decay to a flourishing state once more in a cycle that has repeated itself throughout our recorded history. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about it in The Great Gatsby saying, “And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.”

As humans have expanded our reach, building neighborhoods and settlements and cities, we sometimes find ourselves needing to move on, leaving that which we’d constructed long forgotten to the elements. The reasons can be obvious, like a nuclear meltdown forcing the inhabitants of Pripyat, Ukraine from their homes or more mundane, like the abandonment of a diamond mining town of Kolmanskop, Namibia.

But, is a place really abandoned just because humans have left? Not at all! In the absence of people, some places we’ve previously thought of as desolate are actually more populated than ever. The new occupants? Wildlife. Left alone to forage, breed and thrive undisturbed by people, many different kinds of animals and insects are turning dilapidated shopping malls, empty houses and forgotten islands into their own personal Trump Towers. Acting as natural sanctuaries, these places are affording animals, some of whom face endangerment, a place to strengthen their numbers and enjoy lives of freedom.

Desert wasteland or haven for horses?

Abandoned in 1954, Kolmanskop, Namibia was once a flourishing diamond mining town until the mines were eventually exhausted of their riches. The human inhabitants of the town moved on and left what had been their homes, schools and shops to be taken back by the desert and the rare Namib Horse.

Their origin is unknown as these horses are not indigenous to the region but by limiting human intervention, only offering water support during extreme drought, these horses have been able to adapt incredibly well to the unforgiving terrain and grow in numbers over the years in the ruins of this forgotten town.

Arson and safety issues plagued the New World Shopping Mall in Bangkok, Thailand until it was shuttered in 1997. The roofless structure sat empty, collecting rainwater in it’s basement until a 1600 square foot pond formed. Mosquitos began to take up residence, annoying locals around the forgotten structure so much that they introduced some koi and catfish into the pond to combat the problem.

Left to breed uninhibited, the fish flourished in their new environment and turned the mall into their own private aquarium. The future of the fish is unclear as there are questions about the stability of the building, but for now locals visit the fish to throw them food.

While walking around the woods surrounding his summer home in Salo, Finland, photographer Kai Fagerström came upon a derelict house. Not one to miss a chance to snap some unique shots, Fagerström ventured inside to see that the house may have been derelict but it was far from empty.

The house was teeming with animal tenants like badgers, mice, foxes and birds to name just a few. In fact, 12 different species of animals were all living together in harmony under the same roof, becoming the subjects to his photo book The House in the Woods.

In 1986 the residents of Pripyat, Ukraine were forced to abandon their homes as the nearby Chernobyl Power Complex experienced what is considered the worst nuclear meltdown in history. The area has been deemed uninhabitable for the next 20,000 years as radiation levels in the area continue to measure off of the charts, but that hasn’t stopped a large variety of wildlife and insect species from moving in.

In fact, the native animal populations like wild boar, dogs and horses have thrived in the exclusion zone, making the area around Chernobyl a natural refuge in the absence of human occupants. Scientists have only recently been allowed access to study the area and its inhabitants, with the results providing an unsure glimpse at how the thriving populations will be effected by the radiation for generations to come. Only time will tell, but for now the city of Pripyat is populated with a diverse selection of life.

With people only being allowed to enter through special permit over the last 60 years, the area has become the perfect place for a large variety of indigenous and critically endangered wildlife to live undisturbed.

Animals like the endangered white necked crane, vulnerable Amur gorals, the asiatic black bear, Siberian musk dear and the nearly extinct Amur leopard are among the 2,716 different species thought to inhabit the area.

A landmine ridden island is a goldmine for penguins.

blogs.reuters.com

After the dust settled in the Falkland Islands War in 1982, the waters surrounding the area became so overfished that local penguin populations began to decrease dramatically. Ironically, it was this very overfishing and the ravages of the war that preceded it that ended up creating a unique natural habitat for the penguins to start rebuilding their numbers and living freely.

As a deterrent to the British, the Argentinian army laid 20,000 land mines along the coast and pasture lands surrounding the capital that remain to this day. Too light to set them off, the penguin population lives happily and totally undisturbed in this unlikely sanctuary.

Since 2001 the Mass Transit Authority of New York has been participating in a program that retires old subway cars and dumps them along the eastern seaboard to create artificial reefs. Known as Redbird Reef, the cars are stripped of floating materials and then cleaned before they’re dropped into the ocean from barges.

By 2010 the program had placed over 2500 cars into the water in the hopes of giving marine life in the area a home to breed and thrive, including black sea bass, flounder, turtles and barnacles.

If you said there was an entire island populated by rabbits, no-bunny would believe you.

The tiny island known as Okunoshima Island in Takehara, Japan is also colloquially known as Usagi Jima, or “Rabbit Island.” Abandoned after World War II, the island had been home to a poison gas facility.

How the rabbits came to be on the island is a source of debate but with larger animals like cats and dogs being banned from its shores, the bunnies of Usagi Jima are free to roam wild and multiply while taking the occasional carrot from an adoring tourist.

What was once the fourth largest lake in the world, the Aral Sea in Central Asia is now on the verge of being completely dry due to rivers and damns diverting its water elsewhere.

Nature renews itself, going from times of stagnation and decay to a flourishing state once more in a cycle that has repeated itself throughout our recorded history. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote about it in The Great Gatsby saying, “And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.”

As humans have expanded our reach, building neighborhoods and settlements and cities, we sometimes find ourselves needing to move on, leaving that which we’d constructed long forgotten to the elements. The reasons can be obvious, like a nuclear meltdown forcing the inhabitants of Pripyat, Ukraine from their homes or more mundane, like the abandonment of a diamond mining town of Kolmanskop, Namibia.

But, is a place really abandoned just because humans have left? Not at all! In the absence of people, some places we’ve previously thought of as desolate are actually more populated than ever. The new occupants? Wildlife. Left alone to forage, breed and thrive undisturbed by people, many different kinds of animals and insects are turning dilapidated shopping malls, empty houses and forgotten islands into their own personal Trump Towers. Acting as natural sanctuaries, these places are affording animals, some of whom face endangerment, a place to strengthen their numbers and enjoy lives of freedom.

Desert wasteland or haven for horses?

Abandoned in 1954, Kolmanskop, Namibia was once a flourishing diamond mining town until the mines were eventually exhausted of their riches. The human inhabitants of the town moved on and left what had been their homes, schools and shops to be taken back by the desert and the rare Namib Horse.

Their origin is unknown as these horses are not indigenous to the region but by limiting human intervention, only offering water support during extreme drought, these horses have been able to adapt incredibly well to the unforgiving terrain and grow in numbers over the years in the ruins of this forgotten town.

Arson and safety issues plagued the New World Shopping Mall in Bangkok, Thailand until it was shuttered in 1997. The roofless structure sat empty, collecting rainwater in it’s basement until a 1600 square foot pond formed. Mosquitos began to take up residence, annoying locals around the forgotten structure so much that they introduced some koi and catfish into the pond to combat the problem.

Left to breed uninhibited, the fish flourished in their new environment and turned the mall into their own private aquarium. The future of the fish is unclear as there are questions about the stability of the building, but for now locals visit the fish to throw them food.

While walking around the woods surrounding his summer home in Salo, Finland, photographer Kai Fagerström came upon a derelict house. Not one to miss a chance to snap some unique shots, Fagerström ventured inside to see that the house may have been derelict but it was far from empty.

ngm.nationalgeographic.com

The house was teeming with animal tenants like badgers, mice, foxes and birds to name just a few. In fact, 12 different species of animals were all living together in harmony under the same roof, becoming the subjects to his photo book The House in the Woods.

In 1986 the residents of Pripyat, Ukraine were forced to abandon their homes as the nearby Chernobyl Power Complex experienced what is considered the worst nuclear meltdown in history. The area has been deemed uninhabitable for the next 20,000 years as radiation levels in the area continue to measure off of the charts, but that hasn’t stopped a large variety of wildlife and insect species from moving in.

abandonedkansai.wordpress.com

In fact, the native animal populations like wild boar, dogs and horses have thrived in the exclusion zone, making the area around Chernobyl a natural refuge in the absence of human occupants. Scientists have only recently been allowed access to study the area and its inhabitants, with the results providing an unsure glimpse at how the thriving populations will be effected by the radiation for generations to come. Only time will tell, but for now the city of Pripyat is populated with a diverse selection of life.

The saying, “No Man’s Land” need not apply to wildlife.

In place since the Korean War Armistice in 1953, a 250 km long and 4 km wide swath of land known as the Demilitarized Zone separates North and South Korea from coast to coast. With people only being allowed to enter through special permit over the last 60 years, the area has become the perfect place for a large variety of indigenous and critically endangered wildlife to live undisturbed.

news.nationalgeographic.com

Animals like the endangered white necked crane, vulnerable Amur gorals, the asiatic black bear, Siberian musk dear and the nearly extinct Amur leopard are among the 2,716 different species thought to inhabit the area.

A landmine ridden island is a goldmine for penguins.

blogs.reuters.com

After the dust settled in the Falkland Islands War in 1982, the waters surrounding the area became so overfished that local penguin populations began to decrease dramatically. Ironically, it was this very overfishing and the ravages of the war that preceded it that ended up creating a unique natural habitat for the penguins to start rebuilding their numbers and living freely.

As a deterrent to the British, the Argentinian army laid 20,000 land mines along the coast and pasture lands surrounding the capital that remain to this day. Too light to set them off, the penguin population lives happily and totally undisturbed in this unlikely sanctuary.

The occupants of this subway car seem a little fishy.

Since 2001 the Mass Transit Authority of New York has been participating in a program that retires old subway cars and dumps them along the eastern seaboard to create artificial reefs. Known as Redbird Reef, the cars are stripped of floating materials and then cleaned before they’re dropped into the ocean from barges.

By 2010 the program had placed over 2500 cars into the water in the hopes of giving marine life in the area a home to breed and thrive, including black sea bass, flounder, turtles and barnacles.

If you said there was an entire island populated by rabbits, no-bunny would believe you.

The tiny island known as Okunoshima Island in Takehara, Japan is also colloquially known as Usagi Jima, or “Rabbit Island.” Abandoned after World War II, the island had been home to a poison gas facility.

montrealgazette.com

How the rabbits came to be on the island is a source of debate but with larger animals like cats and dogs being banned from its shores, the bunnies of Usagi Jima are free to roam wild and multiply while taking the occasional carrot from an adoring tourist.

This island gets an (elephant) seal of approval.

Formerly a Coast Guard light station until it was abandoned in 1948, Año Nuevo Island in California is teeming with wildlife. Now part of a nature preserve operated by the California State Parks, the island boasts one of the largest northern elephant seal mainland breeding colonies in the world.

It also plays host to cormorants, terns, otters, California sea lions as well as the rare and endangered San Francisco Garter Snake.

0,"Roll over! Fetch! Speak! These are nice tricks for the average house pet to know, but some animals are capable of doing much more. These gifted dogs—and birds!—can surf, tell jokes and help keep your health in check. Here are five incredible animals that give their humans a new lease on life.

Surf’s Up

Ricochet, a 9-year-old golden retriever, has learned to roll with the tide—and help others do it, too.

After dropping out of service-dog training—the San Diego, California, pup wanted to chase everything—the four-legged YouTube sensation now encourages veterans and kids with disabilities to step outside their comfort zone atop a surfboard. Ricochet helps counterbalance the surfboard, standing on the back to keep it steady or serving as a handle for her partner, says owner and trainer Judy Fridono.

The transformations after just one surﬁng session can be astounding. “That is sometimes the ﬁrst time ever the kids have been completely independent,” says Fridono. “It’s a very empowering thing.”

Ricochet is helping kids like West Butner, 11, who has autism and a speech disorder called apraxia. When West ﬁrst met Ricochet, he was afraid of dogs and water and preferred spending his time alone in his bedroom. But the pair developed an immediate bond, and now West is conﬁdent enough to be interviewed on camera for an ESPN segment on Ricochet’s work with kids and veterans.

“Here’s this kid with such a severe diagnosis, who couldn’t speak,” says his mother Lauren Chavez. “He’s completely changed because of Ricochet.”

Owner Fridono discovered Ricochet’s ability when the dog climbed onto a boogie board in a kiddie pool at just 8 weeks old. Amazed at the canine’s calming effect on both kids and adults, Fridono founded Waves of Empowerment, a program for veterans transitioning back into civilian life and children with disabilites, bringing them together to surf with Ricochet.

“We create an environment where it’s a safe social place,” says Fridono. “Clinicians, teachers and doctors treating them are always trying to get them to come back into our world. Ricochet goes into their world, and they’re comfortable with her because she doesn’t have those expectations.”

Free as a Bird

After a three-year stint in the Army as an ammunition specialist during the late 1970s, Christopher Driggins, now 57, found himself still fighting, long after his military career ended. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had taken hold of his life and he withdrew socially. His salvation came in a surprising form: a Goffin’s cockatoo named Cezar.

The Vancouver, Washington, veteran already kept a few birds of his own as a hobby when he learned of a family that no longer wanted their bird. Driggins drove out to the home to find the bird cooped up in a small cage in a garage that reeked of gasoline. He rescued Cezar that day, but Cezar also rescued him.

“I took him with me everywhere,” Driggins says. “He was riding on my shoulder, riding in the car with me on a perch. And I realized I was becoming more sociable.”

With Cezar in tow, people would strike up conversations and help Driggins make connections. Funny one-liners were one of the duo’s specialties. “A lot of people would ask ‘Oh, does your bird talk?’” So Driggins taught Cezar the tongue-in-cheek reply: “Can you fly?”

The more he worked with Cezar and his other birds, the better Driggins felt. “At the end of the day, all I could do was think about the birds,” he says. “What am I going to do for them in the morning? What’s our day going to be like? The next thing I knew, I wasn’t having anxiety when I went to bed. The nightmares started going away.”

Inspired by his bond with Cezar and his newfound zeal for life, Driggins made it his mission to spread that same joy to other veterans. In 2015, he founded Parrots for Patriots, an organization that places rescued birds with veterans seeking companionship. For many service members, a dog or cat that lives only 10 to 15 years can be another source of sadness, but birds can live to be 40 or even 80 years old.

“I know there are hundreds of veterans out there who don’t know what birds can do for them,” he says. “It’s so touching to see other veterans come out of their shell.”

Since its founding, Parrots for Patriots has placed more than 140 birds, rescuing abandoned birds and training them. Driggins teaches many of the birds to salute, something that’s a special surprise for veteran adopters.

Between his own birds and temporarily housing birds before they are adopted, Driggins has a home full of tweeting friends. And he wouldn’t have it any other way.

“They saved my life,” he says. “I’m appreciated every day by them, and without their love and appreciation, I don’t think I would keep moving forward.”

Canine Co-Star

A rare disease brought one teen’s dreams of studying journalism and theater to a halt—until her four-legged “miracle” helped her retake center stage.

(Laura Wood)

By the time Laura Wood was 18 years old, she was fainting up to 40 times each day. She was completely homebound in North Reading, Mass., and relied on her mother and boyfriend for daily tasks.

“I felt alone,” the now 27-year-old says. “They had to put me in a helmet, and pad all the hallways. I had to leave college because I was so sick.”

Doctors could not pinpoint a diagnosis and Wood began losing hope. In 2012, a fainting spell caused her to fall from a three-story balcony, resulting in multiple surgeries. Her depression worsened and she even attempted to take her own life.

Eventually Wood was diagnosed with dysautonomia, a condition that affects the autonomic, or involuntary, nervous system, and often is not immediately apparent. The “invisible” disorder causes her heart rate to spike or drop and her blood pressure to plummet, which is what makes her lose consciousness.

Medication eased her fainting spells but didn’t cure the problem. In search of additional help, she discovered Canine Partners for Life, a Pennsylvania-based organization that matched her with service dog Zeva, a yellow Labrador retriever.

“We clicked immediately,” Wood says.

The self-proclaimed “sassy duo” has lived side-by-side for the last two years. And for two years, Wood has not lost consciousness, not once. When Zeva senses a spell, she stops in front of Wood to make her sit and places her paws across her lap until the threat of fainting passes.

“Now I’m independent again,” she says. “I’m stronger than I have been in years. I’m back doing theater again, which for me, is everything.”

Wood is working to help others ﬁnd their Zeva. She’s writing a book about her experience to encourage others with invisible disorders to pursue help.

“I know it’s hard,” she says. “I just want to help at least one person and show them there is an outlet.”

And after a new study, scientists in Vienna have found that cockatoos are also skilled at making tools.

Researchers were shocked to find that Goffin's cockatoos could spontaneously make hooks to grab a food reward from inside a small tube.

As cockatoos are not specialised to make tools for foraging, the test showed that the species is capable of innovative problem-solving.

This clever cockatoo was able to expertly craft a tool to fish its basket of treats from a plastic tube

In the study, the Goffin's were set two tasks by researchers from the University of Vienna and the Veterinary University Vienna.

First, the birds were confronted with a vertical tube containing a basket with a handle and food reward inside, in addition to a straight piece of pipe cleaner.

In the second, they were faced with a horizontal tube with a reward in the middle and a piece of pipe cleaner that was bent at a 90 degree angle.

In both tasks, the birds were expected to spontaneously adapt the pipe cleaner into a tool that could grab the food.

'Retrieving the reward from the vertical tube thus required the birds to bend a hook into the straight pipe cleaner to fish the basket out of the tube,' Isabelle Laumer said, who conducted the study, according to phys.org.

Goffin's cockatoos do not have a hereditary disposition to create tools for foraging, and they do not bend sticks when they make their nests. The birds used problem-solving to complete the task

She said: 'The horizontal tube required the birds to unbend the bent piece of wire to push the food out of the tube.'

Several birds managed to complete either the hook bending and unbending tasks.

One bird was able to solve both.

One quick cockatoo was able to master both of its assigned tasks - hooking its treats from a horizontal and vertical tube

Scientists wanted to find out if a bird without a hereditary predisposition for creating tools was able to use problem-solving to make them

The study came after the New Caledonian crow Betty in Oxford famously solved a puzzle set by the University of Oxford in 2002.

Betty the crow made her name when she expertly bent a straight piece of wire into a hook to retrieve a bucket of food.

It was believed that Betty was able to spontaneously understand the task and come up with the hooked solution.

Betty the crow stunned the world in 2002 when she seemed to spontaneously shape a piece of garden wire into a hook that would reach a basket of food in the bottom of this tube

New Caledonian crows are specialised tool-makers in the wild - meaning that the ability is innate - but it was thought that Betty displayed innovation in problem-solving.

The study was widely understood as an amazing demonstration of intelligent behaviour in a non-human animal.

However, this conclusion was called into question when researchers from the University of St Andrews found that wild New Caledonian crows used similar bending techniques to make curves in twig tools.

The Goffin's cockatoos have now proved that their species at least is able to create hooks.

Researchers said that because the tasks were solved by a limited number of birds, and because they used individual methods to make the hooks, the study showed that Goffin's cockatoos had to invent a solution to the problem.

'Our results suggest that their hook bending from pliant material does not require strong hereditary predispositions from specialised tool use/manufacture or nest building,' said Alice Auersberg, the head of the Goffin Lan at the Messerli Research Institute in Vienna.

'It seems to indeed arise from more general modes of cognitive processing,' she continued.

0,"The Goffin’s cockatoo, it turns out, is no featherbrain. At the University of Vienna, researchers were astounded and delighted when a crackle of cockatoos fashioned hooks out of green pipe cleaners to extract a tantalizing piece of cashew from a clear tube. The crowning glory of this achievement? Many had likely never seen a hook before.

In a second test, they had to unbend their original pipe cleaner to push food out of a different tube. Several birds mastered one task or the other, and one was even able to solve both problems. Solutions, researcher Isabelle Laumer said in a release from the university, were highly individualized, and their success seemed to have no bearing on their prior experience with similar tasks.

That cockatoos can solve these kinds of problems at all is surprising. In the wild, cockatoos don’t “specialize” in what is called “tool-assisted foraging,” said Alice Auersperg, head of the Goffin Lab where the experiments took place. “Goffin’s cockatoos have to actively invent the solution to the problem, rather than retreating to inborn stereotyped behavioral routines,” she said. “It seems that, at least for now and for this particular species, we can get the innovative aspect of hook bending off the hook.”

The experiments come on the back of experiments conducted with New Caledonian crows. In the early 2000s, a crow named Betty shocked the scientific community when she bent wire into a hook to retrieve a small basket from a tube. Studies since have suggested that this is a common behavior for the species, as similar behaviors were observed in the wild. At that time, the study of cognition in birds was unusual, but now scientists say that crows and parrots seem to be as capable of certain complex thoughts and behaviors as monkeys, apes, and humans, and have similar neuron counts in the corresponding brain regions.

What exactly constitutes tool use among animals has long been the source of some debate. Some scientists are content to describe it as “an object carried or maintained for future use,” while others say that to be a true tool it must have been “modified to fit a purpose” or be “used in some way to cause a change in the environment.” By either definition, tool use has been observed throughout the animal kingdom. In 1990, Jane Goodall, the British primatologist, famously observed a chimpanzee using a blade of grass like a Fun Dip stick to extract termites from their nests. Other chimps and bonobos have fashioned proto-sponges out of leaves and moss to wash themselves, or created shelters from the rain out of leaves. Elephants use branches to swat away flies, dolphins use conch shells to scoop up fish, wild bears use stones to exfoliate. Even bees can be taught to use tools or pull a string to receive a reward.

Actually making tools, as the crows and cockatoos in the experiments appear to, is far rarer and shows even greater cognitive ability. Birds are particularly impressive in this regard. Crows can fashion probes out of twigs or wire to impale larvae, and woodpecker finches adapt cactus spines to help them catch or spear slow-moving insects. This may be the first time Goffin’s cockatoos have been seen altering tools in this way, but they are in good parrot company. The kea, a New Zealand mountain parrot, strips twigs and puts them into traps to trigger them—apparently only because they like the banging noise they make.

Whatever the reason, corvids and parrots put human children to shame when it comes to problem solving of this sort. Most human children fail the same task set to the cockatoos completely up to the age of five, and it’s not until they get to about eight that they’re able to successfully bend the wire.",Clever Cockatoos’ Tool Use Is Off the Hook,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0bGFzb2JzY3VyYS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvY29ja2F0b29zLXRvb2xzLWNyb3dzLXdpcmUtc2NpZW5jZS1jb2duaXRpb27SAVZodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdGxhc29ic2N1cmEuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2NvY2thdG9vcy10b29scy1jcm93cy13aXJlLXNjaWVuY2UtY29nbml0aW9uLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzLzhiYjM0NTQyMzJmNjhkODRkN19jb2NrYXRvby5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/cockatoo.jpg,2017-09-06,"{'sent': 'The Goffin’s cockatoo, it turns out, is no featherbrain.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Goffin']}}","The Goffin’s cockatoo, it turns out, is no featherbrain.

0,"It's beginning to snow as my train nears the small town of Kinosaki Onsen, lending an ethereal veneer to the hills north-west of Kyoto. Arriving at the station, I can see the steamy breath of several people huddled outside, among them Noro Randria, my ""local"" guide. Randria is a young French Madagascan, whose obsession with Japanese culture led her to come to the hot spring resort of Kinosaki to live and work.

Also clopping along nearby are a Japanese couple wearing yukata – a traditional wraparound robe secured around the waist with an ""obi"" band – as well as socks, wooden sandals and warm overcoats.

""The whole of Kinosaki is like one big ryokan or Japanese inn,"" explains Randria, ""with the station like the front door, the roads its hallways and each inn a different room.

DANIEL SCOTT Kinosaki Onsen town.

""So, rather than always have to get changed to walk between their accommodation and Kinosaki's seven bathhouses,"" she adds, ""people slip on yukata, which each ryokan lends guests for free.""

DANIEL SCOTT Bath house in Kinosaki Onsen.

According to legend, the discovery of Kinosaki's hot springs dates back to the Asuka period in the sixth and seventh century when an oriental white stork was witnessed bathing its wounds in the waters.

Officially, though, it was the Buddhist priest Dochi Shonin who first brought attention to the springs during the eighth century Nara period.

A temple dedicated to Shonin, the Onsenji stands at the far end of town on the slopes of Mount Daishiyama, and it's here that most visitors come to give thanks before embarking on their ablutions.

DANIEL SCOTT Mikuniya Dan - Big bath with garden view.

Reached via a cable car, the top of Mount Daisihi normally heralds views over the whole town and nearby coastline, but today the surrounds are dank and mushy.

Yet, back on street-level, even in these wintry conditions, Kinosaki, rebuilt in traditional style following an earthquake in 1925, seems compact and pretty.

Wiry cherry blossom trees line the banks of the central Otanigawa river and three-storey wooden ryokan are interspersed between the sotoyu (public bathhouses).

DANIEL SCOTT Matsuba crab season.

It's now also the November-March Matsuba crab season, a specialty of this region's cuisine along with Tajima beef. There are extravagant representations of crustaceans above shops and restaurants all around town.

Lovely though it is outside, I'm keen to check in to the cosy Mikuniya ryokan, half-way down the main street, and to experience my first Kinosaki bathhouse.

After adorning myself in a yukata, incongruously worn over my thermal underwear and with sneakers as I find the wooden sandals too uncomfortable, I wander self-consciously across town and am drawn first into the grand entrance way of the Goshonoyu bathhouse, adjacent to a shrine.

SHOGO NISHIYAMA Kinosaki Onsen at night.

As I store my shoes in a locker in the foyer, a young Japanese family arrives, Dad and Mum with 10-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter, separating to enter the male and female sections.

Inside the male changing room, I get unchanged and notice how the father leads his very serious-looking son through the bathing ritual, passing on the centuries-old etiquette.

For anybody used to playing competitive team sports same-sex nudity isn't that confronting and it's all so matter-of-fact inside the bathhouse that it shouldn't be an issue.

DANIEL SCOTT Buddhist monk Udo Kohara at Sukyoji Temple Izushi.

However, brandishing nothing bigger than a hand towel for modesty, I'm grateful to slip into the first bath, one of several open cubicles with side rails to hold onto and upwelling bubbles to soothe aches and pains.

Being British of origin I love a bath, indeed it was the only way to get warm in the bad old days of crappy uni accommodation in relentlessly rainy, cold Manchester, and so I take to the onsen experience like a lucky duck, sinking up to my neck in the steaming water.

I also see a long soak as a creative space, doing much of my reading in the tub and often jotting ideas into a notebook and it seems I am not alone.

Over the centuries, Kinosaki has attracted many writers and artists, including 20th-century Japanese author Shiga Naoya, who wrote stories about the town.

At night, Kinosaki has the feel of a fairy tale, with paper lanterns along the riverside, lights reflected in the water and visitors wandering about in their yukata.

Nonetheless, once back in my tatami-matted room at the ryokan, my bones warmed through by bathing, I'm more than happy to have a traditional kaiseki dinner served to me in my room (crab and beef included) and avail myself of the free Wi-Fi to Facetime my wide-eyed daughters.

The next morning I start the day at a second bathhouse, Jizouyu, just down the street, one of four that open at 7am. No sotoyu is further than 400 metres from the next and if you're staying at any Kinosaki ryokan, you're entitled to free entry to all seven.

Jizouyu is already busy in the early morning and while my body rhythms are better suited to a long afternoon soak, my visit prepares me well for a day visiting nearby Izushi, a castle town that prospered during the Edo period, between 1603 and 1868.

After taking in the ruins of the samurai-built castle in the foothills above Izushi, and getting a behind-the-scenes tour of the town's restored Eirakukan kabuki theatre, our next stop is one of its 50 noodle shops.

Izushi's Sara Soba noodles are distinct from the heartier type served elsewhere, are served on small plates made from fine white porcelain and require a delicate hand in the making.

I find this out during a soba noodle making experience under the tutelage of master practitioner, Amemori. While Amemori and my guide Randria make light work of the dough created from 300 grams of buckwheat flour and 150ml of water, my efforts are laughably lumpy.

I'm not much better at Zazen meditation, which I try next, at Sukyoji Temple.

Led by Buddhist monk, Udo Kohara, I try hard to adopt the correct seated and cross-legged posture for this meditative technique and even harder to concentrate on the sounds of nature outside. But I get too fixated on my aching knees and racing thoughts to succeed.

Yet the half-hour meditation does leave me in a contemplative mood and I'm drawn to the monk's gentle spirit and selfless dedication.

Over a tea ceremony I ask Kohara his definition of happiness, that most elusive of 21st-century concerns.

He pauses for a while, then answers:

""In order to become happy,"" he says, ""you have to experience true despair.""

He goes on to explain that for him, the long periods of meditation he undertook as a monk were sometimes extremely painful but that he came to see that the body was ""merely the vessel for the human spirit"".

He therefore understood that he had to accept the pain to work toward being in the best condition to accept death.

Back in Kinosaki, I transfer next door to a more modern ryokan, Enn, and head out to dinner with my guide, remembering the monk's words as I struggle to get comfortable kneeling Japanese-style at the table.

Later we spend an hour in a tiny karaoke bar, where Katsuko Habuchi, the sweet old lady serving us, sings us a Japanese love song and gifts me a hand-fashioned origami stork.

My winter visit to Kinosaki has been timely, allowing me, like that mythical stork of way-back-when, to begin healing the emotional wounds inflicted by multiple losses and separation, and to recognise that sometimes, happiness can be as simple as a warm bath.

Arriving at the station, I can see the steamy breath of several people huddled outside, among them Noro Randria, my ""local"" guide. Randria is a young French Madagascan, whose obsession with Japanese culture led her to come to the hot spring resort of Kinosaki to live and work.

Also clopping along nearby are a Japanese couple wearing yukata – a traditional wraparound robe secured around the waist with an ""obi"" band – as well as socks, wooden sandals and warm overcoats.

""The whole of Kinosaki is like one big ryokan or Japanese inn,"" explains Randria, ""with the station like the front door, the roads its hallways and each inn a different room.

""So, rather than always have to get changed to walk between their accommodation and Kinosaki's seven bathhouses,"" she adds, ""people slip on yukata, which each ryokan lends guests for free.""

DANIEL SCOTT Bath house in Kinosaki Onsen.

According to legend, the discovery of Kinosaki's hot springs dates back to the Asuka period in the sixth and seventh century when an oriental white stork was witnessed bathing its wounds in the waters.

Officially, though, it was the Buddhist priest Dochi Shonin who first brought attention to the springs during the eighth century Nara period.

A temple dedicated to Shonin, the Onsenji stands at the far end of town on the slopes of Mount Daishiyama, and it's here that most visitors come to give thanks before embarking on their ablutions.

DANIEL SCOTT Mikuniya Dan - Big bath with garden view.

Reached via a cable car, the top of Mount Daisihi normally heralds views over the whole town and nearby coastline, but today the surrounds are dank and mushy.

Yet, back on street-level, even in these wintry conditions, Kinosaki, rebuilt in traditional style following an earthquake in 1925, seems compact and pretty.

Wiry cherry blossom trees line the banks of the central Otanigawa river and three-storey wooden ryokan are interspersed between the sotoyu (public bathhouses).

DANIEL SCOTT Matsuba crab season.

It's now also the November-March Matsuba crab season, a specialty of this region's cuisine along with Tajima beef. There are extravagant representations of crustaceans above shops and restaurants all around town.

Lovely though it is outside, I'm keen to check in to the cosy Mikuniya ryokan, half-way down the main street, and to experience my first Kinosaki bathhouse.

After adorning myself in a yukata, incongruously worn over my thermal underwear and with sneakers as I find the wooden sandals too uncomfortable, I wander self-consciously across town and am drawn first into the grand entrance way of the Goshonoyu bathhouse, adjacent to a shrine.

SHOGO NISHIYAMA Kinosaki Onsen at night.

As I store my shoes in a locker in the foyer, a young Japanese family arrives, Dad and Mum with 10-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter, separating to enter the male and female sections.

Inside the male changing room, I get unchanged and notice how the father leads his very serious-looking son through the bathing ritual, passing on the centuries-old etiquette.

For anybody used to playing competitive team sports same-sex nudity isn't that confronting and it's all so matter-of-fact inside the bathhouse that it shouldn't be an issue.

DANIEL SCOTT Buddhist monk Udo Kohara at Sukyoji Temple Izushi.

However, brandishing nothing bigger than a hand towel for modesty, I'm grateful to slip into the first bath, one of several open cubicles with side rails to hold onto and upwelling bubbles to soothe aches and pains.

Being British of origin I love a bath, indeed it was the only way to get warm in the bad old days of crappy uni accommodation in relentlessly rainy, cold Manchester, and so I take to the onsen experience like a lucky duck, sinking up to my neck in the steaming water.

I also see a long soak as a creative space, doing much of my reading in the tub and often jotting ideas into a notebook and it seems I am not alone.

Over the centuries, Kinosaki has attracted many writers and artists, including 20th-century Japanese author Shiga Naoya, who wrote stories about the town.

At night, Kinosaki has the feel of a fairy tale, with paper lanterns along the riverside, lights reflected in the water and visitors wandering about in their yukata.

Nonetheless, once back in my tatami-matted room at the ryokan, my bones warmed through by bathing, I'm more than happy to have a traditional kaiseki dinner served to me in my room (crab and beef included) and avail myself of the free Wi-Fi to Facetime my wide-eyed daughters.

The next morning I start the day at a second bathhouse, Jizouyu, just down the street, one of four that open at 7am. No sotoyu is further than 400 metres from the next and if you're staying at any Kinosaki ryokan, you're entitled to free entry to all seven.

Jizouyu is already busy in the early morning and while my body rhythms are better suited to a long afternoon soak, my visit prepares me well for a day visiting nearby Izushi, a castle town that prospered during the Edo period, between 1603 and 1868.

After taking in the ruins of the samurai-built castle in the foothills above Izushi, and getting a behind-the-scenes tour of the town's restored Eirakukan kabuki theatre, our next stop is one of its 50 noodle shops.

Izushi's Sara Soba noodles are distinct from the heartier type served elsewhere, are served on small plates made from fine white porcelain and require a delicate hand in the making.

I find this out during a soba noodle making experience under the tutelage of master practitioner, Amemori. While Amemori and my guide Randria make light work of the dough created from 300 grams of buckwheat flour and 150ml of water, my efforts are laughably lumpy.

I'm not much better at Zazen meditation, which I try next, at Sukyoji Temple.

Led by Buddhist monk, Udo Kohara, I try hard to adopt the correct seated and cross-legged posture for this meditative technique and even harder to concentrate on the sounds of nature outside. But I get too fixated on my aching knees and racing thoughts to succeed.

Yet the half-hour meditation does leave me in a contemplative mood and I'm drawn to the monk's gentle spirit and selfless dedication.

Over a tea ceremony I ask Kohara his definition of happiness, that most elusive of 21st-century concerns.

He pauses for a while, then answers:

""In order to become happy,"" he says, ""you have to experience true despair.""

He goes on to explain that for him, the long periods of meditation he undertook as a monk were sometimes extremely painful but that he came to see that the body was ""merely the vessel for the human spirit"".

He therefore understood that he had to accept the pain to work toward being in the best condition to accept death.

Back in Kinosaki, I transfer next door to a more modern ryokan, Enn, and head out to dinner with my guide, remembering the monk's words as I struggle to get comfortable kneeling Japanese-style at the table.

Later we spend an hour in a tiny karaoke bar, where Katsuko Habuchi, the sweet old lady serving us, sings us a Japanese love song and gifts me a hand-fashioned origami stork.

My winter visit to Kinosaki has been timely, allowing me, like that mythical stork of way-back-when, to begin healing the emotional wounds inflicted by multiple losses and separation, and to recognise that sometimes, happiness can be as simple as a warm bath.

0,"Abstract Global biodiversity loss is disproportionately rapid on islands, where invasive species are a major driver of extinctions. To inform conservation planning aimed at preventing extinctions, we identify the distribution and biogeographic patterns of highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates (classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature) and invasive vertebrates on ~465,000 islands worldwide by conducting a comprehensive literature review and interviews with more than 500 experts. We found that 1189 highly threatened vertebrate species (319 amphibians, 282 reptiles, 296 birds, and 292 mammals) breed on 1288 islands. These taxa represent only 5% of Earth’s terrestrial vertebrates and 41% of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates, which occur in <1% of islands worldwide. Information about invasive vertebrates was available for 1030 islands (80% of islands with highly threatened vertebrates). Invasive vertebrates were absent from 24% of these islands, where biosecurity to prevent invasions is a critical management tool. On the 76% of islands where invasive vertebrates were present, management could benefit 39% of Earth’s highly threatened vertebrates. Invasive mammals occurred in 97% of these islands, with Rattus sp. as the most common invasive vertebrate (78%; 609 islands). Our results provide an important baseline for identifying islands for invasive species eradication and other island conservation actions that reduce biodiversity loss.

INTRODUCTION The loss of biodiversity is one of the most acute global issues linked with severe negative impacts on people and the environment (1–3). Consequently, urgent action is required to reduce biodiversity loss (4, 5). The decline of populations and disappearance of species from islands and freshwater systems are disproportionately more rapid than anywhere else worldwide (6, 7). Islands, in particular, comprise only 5.3% of global land area (8) yet are hotspots of biodiversity (7, 9, 10). Islands are also epicenters of biodiversity loss. They host 61% of known extinctions and 37% of critically endangered species (7). Here, we examine the distribution of highly threatened vertebrates [using the classification by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (11)] on the world’s ~465,000 islands (8) as well as the co-occurrence of invasive species, the primary driver of their extinction (12–14) on these islands. Islands are isolated land masses that often maintain simplified ecological systems containing highly adapted and unique species with typically small population sizes, low reproductive rates, and a lack of predator defenses compared with continental counterparts (9, 15, 16). These traits make island species more prone to human-related impacts. There are many examples of human-mediated extinctions of island vertebrates, such as the Dodo (Raphus cucullatus) and the Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana (Cyclura onchiopsis), which were extirpated by human exploitation and introduced predators (11, 17). Invasive species are the primary driver of island extinctions (12, 17, 18). They are implicated in 86% of extinctions of island species since 1500 A.D. (18) and currently endanger 596 species of birds, mammals, and reptiles listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List (17). The ecological consequences of population decline and extinction are widespread (19). For example, the loss of island-breeding seabirds by introduced predators can alter soil fertility and ultimately transform plant and below-ground ecological communities (20, 21). Extinctions also result in lost mutualistic interactions. The extinction of large frugivores (for example, R. cucullatus and Cylindraspis triserrata) from Mauritius left endemic plants, which are dependent on germination via digestion by these frugivores, without the ability to reproduce (22, 23). The extinction of honeycreepers from Hawaii disrupted pollination of native lobelioids, which are now critically endangered (11, 24). Fortunately, island restoration activities can stop and even reverse some of these trends (25). Many vertebrates are highly threatened, but also often socially valued, and well studied (26, 27), making them important targets for conservation that can also benefit whole-island ecosystems and lesser known taxa (28–30). For example, invasive mammal eradications have provided beneficial outcomes for many threatened island endemics (31, 32), including 62 species classified as threatened on the IUCN Red List (33). Prevention, control, and eradication of invasive species is identified as one of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets for global biodiversity conservation (34). However, few studies have elucidated the specific island locations of island breeding species and where they overlap with potentially damaging invasive species (35). Defining this overlap is necessary to pinpoint where conservation actions can prevent extinctions (35, 36). To address this gap, we created a unique data set [the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database (37); fig. S1 and table S1]. The database documents which of the world’s islands support breeding populations of terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) classified as critically endangered or endangered by the IUCN [hereafter, “highly threatened”; (11)]. In addition, we examine which islands with highly threatened vertebrates are colonized by invasive vertebrates (fig. S2 and table S2). Here, we address the following questions: (i) How many highly threatened island vertebrate species and populations occur on islands? (ii) What are the biogeographic and socioeconomic patterns in the distribution of these highly threatened vertebrates? (iii) Where do invasive vertebrates co-occur with highly threatened vertebrates on islands? (iv) Which vertebrate groups co-occur most frequently with invasive vertebrates? This is a novel comprehensive global synthesis of the biogeography of highly threatened island vertebrates and invasive species on islands. It underpins ongoing work to identify the most important islands for invasive vertebrate eradications and can be used in systematic planning to conserve island biota and as a baseline to document future changes in the status of highly threatened insular vertebrate taxa.

RESULTS Highly threatened vertebrates on islands We identified 1189 highly threatened vertebrate species that breed on islands, including 319 amphibians, 282 reptiles, 296 birds, and 292 mammals (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Ninety-two percent (1094) of these vertebrates breed exclusively on islands, and the remaining 8% (95) breed on both islands and continents (data file S1). These taxa represent only 5% of all IUCN-assessed extant terrestrial vertebrates but a disproportionately higher percentage (41%) of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates when compared with species on continental land masses (11). Fig. 1 Percentage of highly threatened vertebrates breeding on islands by vertebrate class. Numbers above the bar give the total number of highly threatened species that breed on islands. Color shading indicates the number of taxonomic orders within each island vertebrate class. Table 1 Taxonomic comparisons of the 2919 highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates and the 1189 highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates on islands. CR, critically endangered; EN, endangered. View this table: The 1189 highly threatened vertebrate species breed on 1288 islands. These islands represented only 0.3% of the ~465,000 islands worldwide (8) but comprise 61% of global island area. Highly threatened vertebrates occur on some of the largest islands in the world (mean ± SD = 3684.8 ± 37,871.8 km2; median, 3.58 km2), although the island size was variable (range, 5.5 × 10−04 to 773,848.3 km2), compared with islands without highly threatened vertebrates (all other islands worldwide; Fig. 2A). Similarly, 63% of these islands are in the tropics (versus 19% of other islands; Fig. 2B), most often in the central Indo-Pacific biogeographic region (32%; Fig. 3A), particularly in Oceania (21%; Fig. 3B), and are likely to support tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest habitat (42%; Fig. 3C and data file S2). Islands with highly threatened vertebrates occur in 102 countries or territories, of which 51% are considered high income [median gross domestic product (GDP) per capita = $32,696], yet this was lower than expected when compared with other islands (85% high income; median GDP per capita = $42,337; Fig. 2C and data file S2). These islands were broadly distributed across countries yet were most often found in Micronesia, New Zealand, and Indonesia (each with 7% of their islands supporting breeding populations of highly threatened vertebrates), compared with islands without threatened vertebrates, which were most often found in Canada. Fig. 2 Attributes of islands globally with and without highly threatened vertebrates. Comparisons of (A) island size (km2), (B) absolute latitude, and (C) GDP between islands with and without highly threatened terrestrial vertebrate species. Islands with highly threatened vertebrates were larger, more equatorial, and in countries with lower GDP per capita. Fig. 3 The ecoregions of islands globally with and without highly threatened vertebrates. Comparisons across (A) marine realms, (B) biogeographic realms, and (C) terrestrial habitats for islands with and without highly threatened terrestrial vertebrate species present. Islands with highly threatened vertebrates were located primarily in the central Indo-Pacific, Oceania, and the Neotropics and supported primarily tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest habitats. Breeding populations Of the 1189 highly threatened terrestrial vertebrate species, there were 2890 populations breeding on 1288 islands (a population represents one species breeding on one island; Fig. 4). The number of highly threatened species on an island increased nonlinearly with island size (R2 = 0.38, F = 823.4, df = 1, P < 0.01). Islands with the most highly threatened vertebrate populations included Madagascar (156 species), Sri Lanka (76 species), Hispaniola (68 species), and Cuba (60 species). Cumulatively, these four islands were home to 30% (360) of highly threatened vertebrates, including 56% of amphibian, 33% of reptile, 9% of bird, and 21% of mammal species. Fig. 4 The global distribution of highly threatened vertebrates. Location of islands supporting populations of highly threatened (A) amphibians, (B) reptiles, (C) birds, (D) mammals, and the number of islands with breeding populations per highly threatened species (E). Highly threatened vertebrates bred on an average of 2.5 islands (median, 1; range, 1 to 77; Fig. 2), and 70% (829) of species were restricted to breeding on a single island, including 87% of amphibian, 67% of reptile, 51% of bird, and 65% of mammal species. Biogeographic patterns in threatened birds and reptiles tended to be different from amphibians and mammals (Table 2). Threatened birds and reptiles occurred on more islands (mean ± SD islands = 3 ± 6 and 3 ± 7 and maximum islands of 40 and 77, respectively) that were smaller (median, 23.5 and 19.8 km2, respectively) and in higher income countries (55 and 46%, respectively) than other highly threatened vertebrates. Although threatened birds and reptiles overlapped in similar realms across the tropics, threatened reptiles were concentrated on tropical islands (734 populations; 84%), particularly in Oceania (209 populations) and the Neotropics (206 populations). Meanwhile, threatened bird populations were distributed across both tropical (499 populations; 49%) and temperate (465 populations; 46%) climates, primarily driven by the distribution of threatened seabirds. Table 2 Biogeographic island patterns (total and % of total) for the 2890 breeding populations of highly threatened amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammal species. View this table: Population extinctions Of the 1189 highly threatened vertebrates, 8% (99 species) experienced population extinctions (that is, an extirpation, the total loss of a species from an island, but not globally; table S1). The 99 species lost an average of three populations (mean ± SD = 2.7 ± 3.6; median, 2; range, 1 to 28), which predictably scaled nonlinearly with the number of islands from which a species was originally breeding (R2 = 0.3, F = 2.1, P < 0.01). In total, 273 population extinctions occurred in recent centuries from 202 islands. The largest numbers of population extinctions occurred in French Polynesia (Tuamotus, Marquesas) and the United States (Northern Marianas, Hawaii; data file S2). Guam experienced the largest number of population extinctions from a single island (8 species, including 2 reptiles, 5 birds, and 1 mammal population). Forty highly threatened vertebrates have become extinct from ≥50% of their islands (table S3), and birds have lost more populations than other highly threatened vertebrate: 19% (56) of highly threatened birds have experienced ≥1 population extinction (islands lost: mean ± SD = 3 ± 4.5; median, 1; maximum, 28). People and invasive vertebrates on islands Nearly half of the 1288 islands (597; 47%) were uninhabited (data file S2), whereas 130 (10%) were minimally inhabited (1 to 100 people), and 220 (27%) had greater than 10,000 people. The number of human inhabitants on islands increased nonlinearly with island size (R2 = 0.39, F = 163.58, P < 0.01). The presence or absence of non-native terrestrial invasive vertebrate species (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals; hereafter, “invasive vertebrates”) was confirmed on 1030 islands with highly threatened vertebrates, of which 779 (76%) had at least one invasive vertebrate present (Fig. 5). We identified 37 islands with invasive vertebrates that are subject to ongoing eradication efforts where at least one invasive vertebrate species is undergoing removal. Invasive vertebrates were absent from 251 islands (24%). We were unable to determine the status of invasive vertebrates on 258 islands. Fig. 5 The 1030 islands with highly threatened native vertebrates and information on the presence or absence of invasive vertebrates. Of these, 779 (76%) had at least one invasive vertebrate species present. Mammals were the most common invader on these islands (753 islands; 97% of islands with highly threatened vertebrates). We identified 4178 populations of 320 species of invasive vertebrates (table S4). Invasive mammals were found on 753 islands (97% of islands with an invasive vertebrate) and were the most common invasive class (3361 populations of 175 species). Invasive rats (Rattus sp.) occurred on 609 islands (47% of all islands and 78% of islands with invasive vertebrates; table S5). Other common invasive vertebrates included ungulates (on 446 islands), such as pigs (Suidae), cows (Bovidae), and goats (Cervidae); carnivores, such as cats (Felidae; on 419 islands) and dogs (Canidae; on 350 islands); and rodents, such as mice (Mus sp.; on 352 islands). In total, 2217 highly threatened vertebrate populations (77%) co-occurred with an invasive vertebrate, representing at least one population of 1145 species (96%) and 39% of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates on the IUCN Red List. Invasive vertebrates occurred on all of the breeding islands for 87% of highly threatened vertebrates (all islands of 97% of amphibian, 83% of reptile, 80% of bird, and 89% of mammal species contained an invasive vertebrate). Human habitation was a strong predictor of the presence of invasives: 546 of 685 islands with people (80%) supported invasive vertebrates (χ2 = 279, df = 1, P < 0.0001). Invasive vertebrates were on 230 uninhabited islands (30%), and an additional 90 islands (12%) were minimally inhabited (<100 inhabitants). Invasive vertebrate management on these islands could potentially benefit up to 226 populations of 162 threatened vertebrate species. Highly threatened birds (Procellariformes, 20 species; Passeriformes, 19 species) and reptiles (Squamata, 49 species) most frequently occurred on these islands, yet the list represents 3% of amphibian, 18% of reptile, 26% of bird, and 9% of mammal species, including 27 single-island endemics (table S6) and 5.5% of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates on the IUCN Red List (table S6).

DISCUSSION Biogeographic patterns in highly threatened vertebrate species Highly threatened vertebrates were found on islands across all oceans and habitats and within 102 countries or territories. Larger islands tended to have more species as well as more people and invasive vertebrates, which was expected on the basis of island biogeography theory (38) and recent studies showing area as a predictor of the number of native species, humans, and invasive species present (39). Although most highly threatened vertebrates were highly endemic (most were restricted to a single island), there were differences in biogeographic patterns among amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, which are consistent with their different life histories (Table 2). For example, amphibians require access to freshwater and do not easily disperse across saltwater (40, 41). Unsurprisingly, this group was found to be highly endemic and most often found on large continental islands, such as Hispaniola and Sri Lanka. These islands are inhabited by people, with a relatively low per capita income, and nearly all supported invasive vertebrates. Although these biogeographic patterns were similar for highly threatened mammals, particularly nonvolant mammals, mammalian distributions were different from amphibians: Large numbers occurred on Madagascar (36 species; 12% of all threatened island mammals), and 53% of all populations were in the central Indo-Pacific region. Amphibian and mammalian conservation efforts in these regions are often complex and underfunded (42), suggesting that a diversity of conservation approaches and funding strategies (for example, national, international, and private) will be necessary to effectively conserve these species. Highly threatened birds and reptiles tended to have similar biogeographic patterns, occurring on islands that were more often small and uninhabited or minimally inhabited, compared to amphibians or mammals. Birds and reptiles also have higher numbers of population extinctions. Birds were lost from a greater percentage of islands (table S3) than any other taxa, with most population extinctions in French Polynesia (for example, Polynesian ground dove, Gallicolumba erythroptera; 80% of islands lost), a known extinction hotspot (43, 44). Although extinctions are linked to susceptibility and timing of threats (12, 44), birds and reptiles that bred on many islands were more likely to have lost populations than those that bred on fewer islands. Although overarching biogeographic patterns were similar between birds and reptiles, there were some differences. Birds disperse more easily and are a highly diverse class with many different life history strategies (45). These factors likely contributed to the broad variability in island characteristics and endemicity patterns observed in highly threatened birds. There was less variation in patterns for reptilian geography, which tended to be confined to specific regions: 25% of all highly threatened island reptiles were in Madagascar, and almost all other reptile populations (48%) occurred in the Neotropics and Oceania (for example, Fiji and Micronesia). Invasive vertebrates on islands For the islands with highly threatened vertebrates that were free of invasive vertebrates, biosecurity will be an important strategy for preventing invasives from becoming established (46). This is the most cost-effective long-term strategy for managing invasive species on islands (46, 47). However, the majority of islands with highly threatened vertebrates also had invasive vertebrates, most commonly invasive mammals. Rats (Rattus sp.) occurred on 78% of these islands, close to the estimated proportion of island regions worldwide with invasive rodents (48, 49). Although not every threatened vertebrate will be affected by an invasive species, invasive mammals such as rats, ungulates, and cats, the three most common invasive vertebrates on islands, are a major driver in vertebrate extinction and endangerment on islands (17, 18). The control or eradication of invasive mammals is a widely applied tool that has likely benefitted more than 200 vertebrate species worldwide (33). However, only 11% of previous invasive species eradications from islands worldwide have taken place on islands with highly threatened species (50). This likely reflects a focus on national or local conservation priorities and, until recently, a lack of consolidated data on the global distribution of threatened species and invasive species that is needed to guide eradiation planning at this scale. Thus, there is considerable scope to effectively expand island eradication efforts to benefit globally threatened species. Models based on our database suggest that controlling or eradicating rats and other damaging invasive mammals could prevent 41 to 75% of predicted island vertebrate population extinctions (51). Furthermore, investigating the feasibility of eradications on the most promising of the 1288 islands with highly threatened island vertebrates can help meet many global biodiversity targets (52). Ninety-five percent of the human inhabited islands in our data set also contained invasive vertebrates. The presence of invasive species is often associated with the presence of people (12, 53). However, of the 779 islands with invasive vertebrates, 42% were uninhabited or minimally inhabited. Of all highly threatened vertebrates, birds and reptiles most frequently occurred on these islands, particularly seabirds, passerines, lizards, and snakes. These islands may offer the most unique invasive vertebrate management opportunities because invasive vertebrate management is often easier to implement in locations with no or small human populations (54). From this list of islands, it is informative to consider which islands may emerge as particularly important for management that would deliver major impacts for the conservation of island species. Six islands (Table 3) can be highlighted because they support at least two highly threatened vertebrates, including species found nowhere else in the world (that is, single-island endemics or species that have lost populations and occur on only one island), and at least one of the most damaging invasive vertebrates [rodents, cats, dogs, stoats, mongoose, and pigs (17)]. Cumulatively, these islands support 22 populations of 18 highly threatened vertebrates. A thorough assessment of sociopolitical and operational feasibility, as well as a more detailed evaluation of the threat that invasives pose to these threatened species, is now needed. Table 3 Highlighted islands from the threatened island biodiversity database that support highly threatened vertebrate species, including those which are found nowhere else in the world. These islands are uninhabited or minimally inhabited and contain at least one of the most damaging invasive species known (17). Consideration of these islands for invasive species management would deliver major impacts for the conservation of island species. View this table: Knowledge gaps and moving forward Despite being identified as vital locations for biodiversity, islands are often underrepresented in important analyses of opportunities for biodiversity conservation [for example, the studies of Myers et al. (55), Geldmann et al. (56), and Pimm et al. (57)]. Islands make up a minimal amount of global land area, are often remote, and are less easily accessible (58), contributing to an overall lack of information about islands in general compared to continental areas. Consequently, the attributes used in our analysis were coarse (for example, documenting the presence and absence of highly threatened vertebrates rather than their population sizes or specific colony locations) and directed at a subset of vertebrates to conserve (for example, those that are highly threatened instead of all vertebrates), and the breeding status for some highly threatened vertebrates is still unconfirmed, including 45 species that could possibly be extinct (see the Supplementary Materials). Similarly, 20% of islands analyzed lacked any information about invasive vertebrates; thus, general knowledge on the presence or absence of invasives is not complete at the global scale. Finally, although 58% of highly threatened reptiles are from islands, making them the most threatened island vertebrate class, less than 50% of known reptiles have been assessed on the IUCN Red List. Hence, our estimates of island biodiversity, threat, and co-occurrence of invasive vertebrates on these islands are likely underestimates. The enhancement of monitoring methods and genetic tools to find cryptic island species will no doubt fill these knowledge gaps over time.

CONCLUSIONS To inform assessments of limited conservation resources and guide national and international initiatives to protect threatened biodiversity (5, 59), we created the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database (37), which assembles, for the first time, distribution information on all critically endangered and endangered island breeding vertebrates. The data set itself is a dynamic product, reflecting the nature of biodiversity data and management needs, and is informed by the best information available globally at the time of collection. It includes information on which islands threatened species currently and historically bred on and the physical characteristics and socioeconomic attributes of each island. In addition, it includes the distribution of threats from the primary driver of island vertebrate extinction and endangerment, invasive vertebrates. This database provides the ability to identify and prioritize conservation actions, such as prevention, control, and eradication of invasive vertebrates, which could benefit the 41% of the world’s highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates largely confined to islands. Given current technical constraints on successful eradications, eradication of invasives may not be a feasible intervention for some highly threatened vertebrates, particularly amphibians and mammals, because they mostly occur on large and inhabited islands where whole-island interventions are less tractable (54, 60) than on smaller or uninhabited islands. For these and other threatened taxa on such islands, localized approaches, such as local control and fencing out invasive species, translocating threatened species to safe habitats, implementing education programs, and enhancing policy for addressing invasions are critical (45, 61). These alternative actions may be sufficient to tackle the threat of invasive species and facilitate partial or full long-term species recovery or may be important short- to medium-term measures that can maintain highly threatened species until improvements in eradication techniques make these more complex eradications possible (62–64). The Aichi Biodiversity Targets 9 and 12 of the UN Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2020 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 15.5 and 15.8 call to reduce the rate of extinction, particularly by reducing the impact of invasive species (4, 65). However, a recent review of the progress toward international targets to prevent extinctions highlights the limited progress that governments and international bodies have made toward eliminating threats from invasive species (66, 67). The Threatened Island Biodiversity Database is an important conservation tool for addressing this gap. To date, the database (which is publicly available at tib.islandconservation.org) has been provided to dozens of researchers and conservationists and cited in 10 peer-reviewed articles. The data are being used in global island conservation assessments, evaluations of the impact of invasives on native species and human health, and measures of conservation successes [for example, the studies of Dawson et al. (68), McCreless et al. (51), de Wit et al. (69), and Jones et al. (33)], underpinning ongoing efforts to identify the most important islands globally and regionally for eradicating invasive species to benefit threatened biodiversity. These interventions will likely also benefit less well-studied taxa, such as plants and terrestrial invertebrates, many of which are concentrated on the same islands as highly threatened vertebrates and are susceptible to invasive species (9, 28).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Threatened vertebrates on islands We created the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database (37), which contains data on the island distribution of highly threatened terrestrial species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals recognized by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (version 2013). Seabirds breeding on islands were included, but marine mammals and sea turtles were excluded because of the broad global distribution of many of these species’ breeding sites. We downloaded all vertebrate taxa assessed as critically endangered or endangered, then identified those that breed on islands or on both islands and continents. With this list, we followed a systematic review to identify each island with a breeding population of a highly threatened vertebrate species (a species breeding on an island was considered a single population), documenting the present (1990 to 2015, when the data collection process was concluded) and historic (<1990 to 1500 A.D.) breeding status for each population on each island, followed by a review of the data by more than 500 experts (fig. S1 and table S1). Island biogeography We linked each island with an extant breeding population of a threatened vertebrate to the global island database (8) via a unique identification number and spatial reference for each island. This data set provided coordinates, island size (km2), and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) alpha-2 codes for each island, country, or territory. Islands ranged in size from 0.00001 km2 (offshore rocks) to 773,848 km2 (New Guinea). To place these islands into a biogeographic context that can be applied to strategizing conservation of threatened island species, we supplemented the data set with the following metrics downloaded from global online databases: marine ecoregions (70), terrestrial biomes and realms (71), and GDP per capita (72) and as income groups (73). We subsequently compared the distributions of island attributes between the islands with and without highly threatened vertebrates using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for continuous variables (for example, island size) and Pearson χ2 tests for ordinal data (for example, ecoregion). People and invasive vertebrates on islands The presence of human populations on islands plays a significant role in extinction risk for native species (51). Human settlements are associated with major drivers of extinctions and endangerment, including the transport and maintenance of invasive species on islands (43). The presence and relative density of people on islands and the types of invasive species present are important determinants of the strategies available for managing invasive species (46, 54). We conducted a systematic review of the literature and online databases to document the distribution and number of invasive vertebrate species and human inhabitants on islands. With this information, we examined how many islands with invasive vertebrates were either uninhabited or minimally inhabited by people to understand the potential scope of conservation opportunities on islands that would be the most simple to achieve. To identify the presence or absence of people on islands, we referred to human censuses data (through 2014) in government reports, literature, and websites (for example, Wikipedia, tourism websites, and travel blogs). When this was not available, we contacted local experts. Because not all islands had detailed data on the number of human inhabitants, we pooled human population sizes into ordinal categories of 0, 1 to 100, 101 to 1000, 1001 to 10,000, >10,000, or not found. To identify the presence or absence of terrestrial non-native alien vertebrates (hereafter, invasive vertebrates) on islands, we conducted a systematic review of the literature, websites, databases [for example, the Global Invasive Species Database (74)], and expert advice (fig. S2). We focused on non-native terrestrial vertebrates, defined as some of the most damaging terrestrial invaders (75), whose introduction spreads outside their natural range, and which are documented as negatively affecting native terrestrial vertebrates on islands (33, 76). We identified each invasive to the species level when possible or to the most specific taxonomic group possible, then grouped them as: amphibian, reptile (subgroup: snake, turtle, large reptile, and small reptile), mammal [subgroup: cat, dog, rat (Rattus), mouse (Mus), rabbit/hare, mongoose/weasel, primate, raccoon, ungulate, and other], and bird (subgroup: raptor and nonraptor; tables S3 and S4). For each island, invasive vertebrate presence was defined as present, absent, or unknown. Islands were considered to have invasive vertebrates if they were confirmed or suspected to be present or if there was an ongoing eradication (table S2). We did not investigate the impacts of these invasive groups, but we described their co-occurrence on islands with highly threatened vertebrates.

To inform conservation planning aimed at preventing extinctions, we identify the distribution and biogeographic patterns of highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates (classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature) and invasive vertebrates on ~465,000 islands worldwide by conducting a comprehensive literature review and interviews with more than 500 experts. We found that 1189 highly threatened vertebrate species (319 amphibians, 282 reptiles, 296 birds, and 292 mammals) breed on 1288 islands. These taxa represent only 5% of Earth’s terrestrial vertebrates and 41% of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates, which occur in <1% of islands worldwide. Information about invasive vertebrates was available for 1030 islands (80% of islands with highly threatened vertebrates). Invasive vertebrates were absent from 24% of these islands, where biosecurity to prevent invasions is a critical management tool. On the 76% of islands where invasive vertebrates were present, management could benefit 39% of Earth’s highly threatened vertebrates. Invasive mammals occurred in 97% of these islands, with Rattus sp. as the most common invasive vertebrate (78%; 609 islands). Our results provide an important baseline for identifying islands for invasive species eradication and other island conservation actions that reduce biodiversity loss.

INTRODUCTION The loss of biodiversity is one of the most acute global issues linked with severe negative impacts on people and the environment (1–3). Consequently, urgent action is required to reduce biodiversity loss (4, 5). The decline of populations and disappearance of species from islands and freshwater systems are disproportionately more rapid than anywhere else worldwide (6, 7). Islands, in particular, comprise only 5.3% of global land area (8) yet are hotspots of biodiversity (7, 9, 10). Islands are also epicenters of biodiversity loss. They host 61% of known extinctions and 37% of critically endangered species (7). Here, we examine the distribution of highly threatened vertebrates [using the classification by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List (11)] on the world’s ~465,000 islands (8) as well as the co-occurrence of invasive species, the primary driver of their extinction (12–14) on these islands. Islands are isolated land masses that often maintain simplified ecological systems containing highly adapted and unique species with typically small population sizes, low reproductive rates, and a lack of predator defenses compared with continental counterparts (9, 15, 16). These traits make island species more prone to human-related impacts. There are many examples of human-mediated extinctions of island vertebrates, such as the Dodo (Raphus cucullatus) and the Navassa Rhinoceros Iguana (Cyclura onchiopsis), which were extirpated by human exploitation and introduced predators (11, 17). Invasive species are the primary driver of island extinctions (12, 17, 18). They are implicated in 86% of extinctions of island species since 1500 A.D. (18) and currently endanger 596 species of birds, mammals, and reptiles listed as threatened on the IUCN Red List (17). The ecological consequences of population decline and extinction are widespread (19). For example, the loss of island-breeding seabirds by introduced predators can alter soil fertility and ultimately transform plant and below-ground ecological communities (20, 21). Extinctions also result in lost mutualistic interactions. The extinction of large frugivores (for example, R. cucullatus and Cylindraspis triserrata) from Mauritius left endemic plants, which are dependent on germination via digestion by these frugivores, without the ability to reproduce (22, 23). The extinction of honeycreepers from Hawaii disrupted pollination of native lobelioids, which are now critically endangered (11, 24). Fortunately, island restoration activities can stop and even reverse some of these trends (25). Many vertebrates are highly threatened, but also often socially valued, and well studied (26, 27), making them important targets for conservation that can also benefit whole-island ecosystems and lesser known taxa (28–30). For example, invasive mammal eradications have provided beneficial outcomes for many threatened island endemics (31, 32), including 62 species classified as threatened on the IUCN Red List (33). Prevention, control, and eradication of invasive species is identified as one of the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets for global biodiversity conservation (34). However, few studies have elucidated the specific island locations of island breeding species and where they overlap with potentially damaging invasive species (35). Defining this overlap is necessary to pinpoint where conservation actions can prevent extinctions (35, 36). To address this gap, we created a unique data set [the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database (37); fig. S1 and table S1]. The database documents which of the world’s islands support breeding populations of terrestrial vertebrates (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals) classified as critically endangered or endangered by the IUCN [hereafter, “highly threatened”; (11)]. In addition, we examine which islands with highly threatened vertebrates are colonized by invasive vertebrates (fig. S2 and table S2). Here, we address the following questions: (i) How many highly threatened island vertebrate species and populations occur on islands? (ii) What are the biogeographic and socioeconomic patterns in the distribution of these highly threatened vertebrates? (iii) Where do invasive vertebrates co-occur with highly threatened vertebrates on islands? (iv) Which vertebrate groups co-occur most frequently with invasive vertebrates? This is a novel comprehensive global synthesis of the biogeography of highly threatened island vertebrates and invasive species on islands. It underpins ongoing work to identify the most important islands for invasive vertebrate eradications and can be used in systematic planning to conserve island biota and as a baseline to document future changes in the status of highly threatened insular vertebrate taxa.

RESULTS Highly threatened vertebrates on islands We identified 1189 highly threatened vertebrate species that breed on islands, including 319 amphibians, 282 reptiles, 296 birds, and 292 mammals (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Ninety-two percent (1094) of these vertebrates breed exclusively on islands, and the remaining 8% (95) breed on both islands and continents (data file S1). These taxa represent only 5% of all IUCN-assessed extant terrestrial vertebrates but a disproportionately higher percentage (41%) of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates when compared with species on continental land masses (11). Fig. 1 Percentage of highly threatened vertebrates breeding on islands by vertebrate class. Numbers above the bar give the total number of highly threatened species that breed on islands. Color shading indicates the number of taxonomic orders within each island vertebrate class. Table 1 Taxonomic comparisons of the 2919 highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates and the 1189 highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates on islands. CR, critically endangered; EN, endangered. View this table: The 1189 highly threatened vertebrate species breed on 1288 islands. These islands represented only 0.3% of the ~465,000 islands worldwide (8) but comprise 61% of global island area. Highly threatened vertebrates occur on some of the largest islands in the world (mean ± SD = 3684.8 ± 37,871.8 km2; median, 3.58 km2), although the island size was variable (range, 5.5 × 10−04 to 773,848.3 km2), compared with islands without highly threatened vertebrates (all other islands worldwide; Fig. 2A). Similarly, 63% of these islands are in the tropics (versus 19% of other islands; Fig. 2B), most often in the central Indo-Pacific biogeographic region (32%; Fig. 3A), particularly in Oceania (21%; Fig. 3B), and are likely to support tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest habitat (42%; Fig. 3C and data file S2). Islands with highly threatened vertebrates occur in 102 countries or territories, of which 51% are considered high income [median gross domestic product (GDP) per capita = $32,696], yet this was lower than expected when compared with other islands (85% high income; median GDP per capita = $42,337; Fig. 2C and data file S2). These islands were broadly distributed across countries yet were most often found in Micronesia, New Zealand, and Indonesia (each with 7% of their islands supporting breeding populations of highly threatened vertebrates), compared with islands without threatened vertebrates, which were most often found in Canada. Fig. 2 Attributes of islands globally with and without highly threatened vertebrates. Comparisons of (A) island size (km2), (B) absolute latitude, and (C) GDP between islands with and without highly threatened terrestrial vertebrate species. Islands with highly threatened vertebrates were larger, more equatorial, and in countries with lower GDP per capita. Fig. 3 The ecoregions of islands globally with and without highly threatened vertebrates. Comparisons across (A) marine realms, (B) biogeographic realms, and (C) terrestrial habitats for islands with and without highly threatened terrestrial vertebrate species present. Islands with highly threatened vertebrates were located primarily in the central Indo-Pacific, Oceania, and the Neotropics and supported primarily tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forest habitats. Breeding populations Of the 1189 highly threatened terrestrial vertebrate species, there were 2890 populations breeding on 1288 islands (a population represents one species breeding on one island; Fig. 4). The number of highly threatened species on an island increased nonlinearly with island size (R2 = 0.38, F = 823.4, df = 1, P < 0.01). Islands with the most highly threatened vertebrate populations included Madagascar (156 species), Sri Lanka (76 species), Hispaniola (68 species), and Cuba (60 species). Cumulatively, these four islands were home to 30% (360) of highly threatened vertebrates, including 56% of amphibian, 33% of reptile, 9% of bird, and 21% of mammal species. Fig. 4 The global distribution of highly threatened vertebrates. Location of islands supporting populations of highly threatened (A) amphibians, (B) reptiles, (C) birds, (D) mammals, and the number of islands with breeding populations per highly threatened species (E). Highly threatened vertebrates bred on an average of 2.5 islands (median, 1; range, 1 to 77; Fig. 2), and 70% (829) of species were restricted to breeding on a single island, including 87% of amphibian, 67% of reptile, 51% of bird, and 65% of mammal species. Biogeographic patterns in threatened birds and reptiles tended to be different from amphibians and mammals (Table 2). Threatened birds and reptiles occurred on more islands (mean ± SD islands = 3 ± 6 and 3 ± 7 and maximum islands of 40 and 77, respectively) that were smaller (median, 23.5 and 19.8 km2, respectively) and in higher income countries (55 and 46%, respectively) than other highly threatened vertebrates. Although threatened birds and reptiles overlapped in similar realms across the tropics, threatened reptiles were concentrated on tropical islands (734 populations; 84%), particularly in Oceania (209 populations) and the Neotropics (206 populations). Meanwhile, threatened bird populations were distributed across both tropical (499 populations; 49%) and temperate (465 populations; 46%) climates, primarily driven by the distribution of threatened seabirds. Table 2 Biogeographic island patterns (total and % of total) for the 2890 breeding populations of highly threatened amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammal species. View this table: Population extinctions Of the 1189 highly threatened vertebrates, 8% (99 species) experienced population extinctions (that is, an extirpation, the total loss of a species from an island, but not globally; table S1). The 99 species lost an average of three populations (mean ± SD = 2.7 ± 3.6; median, 2; range, 1 to 28), which predictably scaled nonlinearly with the number of islands from which a species was originally breeding (R2 = 0.3, F = 2.1, P < 0.01). In total, 273 population extinctions occurred in recent centuries from 202 islands. The largest numbers of population extinctions occurred in French Polynesia (Tuamotus, Marquesas) and the United States (Northern Marianas, Hawaii; data file S2). Guam experienced the largest number of population extinctions from a single island (8 species, including 2 reptiles, 5 birds, and 1 mammal population). Forty highly threatened vertebrates have become extinct from ≥50% of their islands (table S3), and birds have lost more populations than other highly threatened vertebrate: 19% (56) of highly threatened birds have experienced ≥1 population extinction (islands lost: mean ± SD = 3 ± 4.5; median, 1; maximum, 28). People and invasive vertebrates on islands Nearly half of the 1288 islands (597; 47%) were uninhabited (data file S2), whereas 130 (10%) were minimally inhabited (1 to 100 people), and 220 (27%) had greater than 10,000 people. The number of human inhabitants on islands increased nonlinearly with island size (R2 = 0.39, F = 163.58, P < 0.01). The presence or absence of non-native terrestrial invasive vertebrate species (amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals; hereafter, “invasive vertebrates”) was confirmed on 1030 islands with highly threatened vertebrates, of which 779 (76%) had at least one invasive vertebrate present (Fig. 5). We identified 37 islands with invasive vertebrates that are subject to ongoing eradication efforts where at least one invasive vertebrate species is undergoing removal. Invasive vertebrates were absent from 251 islands (24%). We were unable to determine the status of invasive vertebrates on 258 islands. Fig. 5 The 1030 islands with highly threatened native vertebrates and information on the presence or absence of invasive vertebrates. Of these, 779 (76%) had at least one invasive vertebrate species present. Mammals were the most common invader on these islands (753 islands; 97% of islands with highly threatened vertebrates). We identified 4178 populations of 320 species of invasive vertebrates (table S4). Invasive mammals were found on 753 islands (97% of islands with an invasive vertebrate) and were the most common invasive class (3361 populations of 175 species). Invasive rats (Rattus sp.) occurred on 609 islands (47% of all islands and 78% of islands with invasive vertebrates; table S5). Other common invasive vertebrates included ungulates (on 446 islands), such as pigs (Suidae), cows (Bovidae), and goats (Cervidae); carnivores, such as cats (Felidae; on 419 islands) and dogs (Canidae; on 350 islands); and rodents, such as mice (Mus sp.; on 352 islands). In total, 2217 highly threatened vertebrate populations (77%) co-occurred with an invasive vertebrate, representing at least one population of 1145 species (96%) and 39% of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates on the IUCN Red List. Invasive vertebrates occurred on all of the breeding islands for 87% of highly threatened vertebrates (all islands of 97% of amphibian, 83% of reptile, 80% of bird, and 89% of mammal species contained an invasive vertebrate). Human habitation was a strong predictor of the presence of invasives: 546 of 685 islands with people (80%) supported invasive vertebrates (χ2 = 279, df = 1, P < 0.0001). Invasive vertebrates were on 230 uninhabited islands (30%), and an additional 90 islands (12%) were minimally inhabited (<100 inhabitants). Invasive vertebrate management on these islands could potentially benefit up to 226 populations of 162 threatened vertebrate species. Highly threatened birds (Procellariformes, 20 species; Passeriformes, 19 species) and reptiles (Squamata, 49 species) most frequently occurred on these islands, yet the list represents 3% of amphibian, 18% of reptile, 26% of bird, and 9% of mammal species, including 27 single-island endemics (table S6) and 5.5% of all highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates on the IUCN Red List (table S6).

DISCUSSION Biogeographic patterns in highly threatened vertebrate species Highly threatened vertebrates were found on islands across all oceans and habitats and within 102 countries or territories. Larger islands tended to have more species as well as more people and invasive vertebrates, which was expected on the basis of island biogeography theory (38) and recent studies showing area as a predictor of the number of native species, humans, and invasive species present (39). Although most highly threatened vertebrates were highly endemic (most were restricted to a single island), there were differences in biogeographic patterns among amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, which are consistent with their different life histories (Table 2). For example, amphibians require access to freshwater and do not easily disperse across saltwater (40, 41). Unsurprisingly, this group was found to be highly endemic and most often found on large continental islands, such as Hispaniola and Sri Lanka. These islands are inhabited by people, with a relatively low per capita income, and nearly all supported invasive vertebrates. Although these biogeographic patterns were similar for highly threatened mammals, particularly nonvolant mammals, mammalian distributions were different from amphibians: Large numbers occurred on Madagascar (36 species; 12% of all threatened island mammals), and 53% of all populations were in the central Indo-Pacific region. Amphibian and mammalian conservation efforts in these regions are often complex and underfunded (42), suggesting that a diversity of conservation approaches and funding strategies (for example, national, international, and private) will be necessary to effectively conserve these species. Highly threatened birds and reptiles tended to have similar biogeographic patterns, occurring on islands that were more often small and uninhabited or minimally inhabited, compared to amphibians or mammals. Birds and reptiles also have higher numbers of population extinctions. Birds were lost from a greater percentage of islands (table S3) than any other taxa, with most population extinctions in French Polynesia (for example, Polynesian ground dove, Gallicolumba erythroptera; 80% of islands lost), a known extinction hotspot (43, 44). Although extinctions are linked to susceptibility and timing of threats (12, 44), birds and reptiles that bred on many islands were more likely to have lost populations than those that bred on fewer islands. Although overarching biogeographic patterns were similar between birds and reptiles, there were some differences. Birds disperse more easily and are a highly diverse class with many different life history strategies (45). These factors likely contributed to the broad variability in island characteristics and endemicity patterns observed in highly threatened birds. There was less variation in patterns for reptilian geography, which tended to be confined to specific regions: 25% of all highly threatened island reptiles were in Madagascar, and almost all other reptile populations (48%) occurred in the Neotropics and Oceania (for example, Fiji and Micronesia). Invasive vertebrates on islands For the islands with highly threatened vertebrates that were free of invasive vertebrates, biosecurity will be an important strategy for preventing invasives from becoming established (46). This is the most cost-effective long-term strategy for managing invasive species on islands (46, 47). However, the majority of islands with highly threatened vertebrates also had invasive vertebrates, most commonly invasive mammals. Rats (Rattus sp.) occurred on 78% of these islands, close to the estimated proportion of island regions worldwide with invasive rodents (48, 49). Although not every threatened vertebrate will be affected by an invasive species, invasive mammals such as rats, ungulates, and cats, the three most common invasive vertebrates on islands, are a major driver in vertebrate extinction and endangerment on islands (17, 18). The control or eradication of invasive mammals is a widely applied tool that has likely benefitted more than 200 vertebrate species worldwide (33). However, only 11% of previous invasive species eradications from islands worldwide have taken place on islands with highly threatened species (50). This likely reflects a focus on national or local conservation priorities and, until recently, a lack of consolidated data on the global distribution of threatened species and invasive species that is needed to guide eradiation planning at this scale. Thus, there is considerable scope to effectively expand island eradication efforts to benefit globally threatened species. Models based on our database suggest that controlling or eradicating rats and other damaging invasive mammals could prevent 41 to 75% of predicted island vertebrate population extinctions (51). Furthermore, investigating the feasibility of eradications on the most promising of the 1288 islands with highly threatened island vertebrates can help meet many global biodiversity targets (52). Ninety-five percent of the human inhabited islands in our data set also contained invasive vertebrates. The presence of invasive species is often associated with the presence of people (12, 53). However, of the 779 islands with invasive vertebrates, 42% were uninhabited or minimally inhabited. Of all highly threatened vertebrates, birds and reptiles most frequently occurred on these islands, particularly seabirds, passerines, lizards, and snakes. These islands may offer the most unique invasive vertebrate management opportunities because invasive vertebrate management is often easier to implement in locations with no or small human populations (54). From this list of islands, it is informative to consider which islands may emerge as particularly important for management that would deliver major impacts for the conservation of island species. Six islands (Table 3) can be highlighted because they support at least two highly threatened vertebrates, including species found nowhere else in the world (that is, single-island endemics or species that have lost populations and occur on only one island), and at least one of the most damaging invasive vertebrates [rodents, cats, dogs, stoats, mongoose, and pigs (17)]. Cumulatively, these islands support 22 populations of 18 highly threatened vertebrates. A thorough assessment of sociopolitical and operational feasibility, as well as a more detailed evaluation of the threat that invasives pose to these threatened species, is now needed. Table 3 Highlighted islands from the threatened island biodiversity database that support highly threatened vertebrate species, including those which are found nowhere else in the world. These islands are uninhabited or minimally inhabited and contain at least one of the most damaging invasive species known (17). Consideration of these islands for invasive species management would deliver major impacts for the conservation of island species. View this table: Knowledge gaps and moving forward Despite being identified as vital locations for biodiversity, islands are often underrepresented in important analyses of opportunities for biodiversity conservation [for example, the studies of Myers et al. (55), Geldmann et al. (56), and Pimm et al. (57)]. Islands make up a minimal amount of global land area, are often remote, and are less easily accessible (58), contributing to an overall lack of information about islands in general compared to continental areas. Consequently, the attributes used in our analysis were coarse (for example, documenting the presence and absence of highly threatened vertebrates rather than their population sizes or specific colony locations) and directed at a subset of vertebrates to conserve (for example, those that are highly threatened instead of all vertebrates), and the breeding status for some highly threatened vertebrates is still unconfirmed, including 45 species that could possibly be extinct (see the Supplementary Materials). Similarly, 20% of islands analyzed lacked any information about invasive vertebrates; thus, general knowledge on the presence or absence of invasives is not complete at the global scale. Finally, although 58% of highly threatened reptiles are from islands, making them the most threatened island vertebrate class, less than 50% of known reptiles have been assessed on the IUCN Red List. Hence, our estimates of island biodiversity, threat, and co-occurrence of invasive vertebrates on these islands are likely underestimates. The enhancement of monitoring methods and genetic tools to find cryptic island species will no doubt fill these knowledge gaps over time.

CONCLUSIONS To inform assessments of limited conservation resources and guide national and international initiatives to protect threatened biodiversity (5, 59), we created the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database (37), which assembles, for the first time, distribution information on all critically endangered and endangered island breeding vertebrates. The data set itself is a dynamic product, reflecting the nature of biodiversity data and management needs, and is informed by the best information available globally at the time of collection. It includes information on which islands threatened species currently and historically bred on and the physical characteristics and socioeconomic attributes of each island. In addition, it includes the distribution of threats from the primary driver of island vertebrate extinction and endangerment, invasive vertebrates. This database provides the ability to identify and prioritize conservation actions, such as prevention, control, and eradication of invasive vertebrates, which could benefit the 41% of the world’s highly threatened terrestrial vertebrates largely confined to islands. Given current technical constraints on successful eradications, eradication of invasives may not be a feasible intervention for some highly threatened vertebrates, particularly amphibians and mammals, because they mostly occur on large and inhabited islands where whole-island interventions are less tractable (54, 60) than on smaller or uninhabited islands. For these and other threatened taxa on such islands, localized approaches, such as local control and fencing out invasive species, translocating threatened species to safe habitats, implementing education programs, and enhancing policy for addressing invasions are critical (45, 61). These alternative actions may be sufficient to tackle the threat of invasive species and facilitate partial or full long-term species recovery or may be important short- to medium-term measures that can maintain highly threatened species until improvements in eradication techniques make these more complex eradications possible (62–64). The Aichi Biodiversity Targets 9 and 12 of the UN Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2020 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals 15.5 and 15.8 call to reduce the rate of extinction, particularly by reducing the impact of invasive species (4, 65). However, a recent review of the progress toward international targets to prevent extinctions highlights the limited progress that governments and international bodies have made toward eliminating threats from invasive species (66, 67). The Threatened Island Biodiversity Database is an important conservation tool for addressing this gap. To date, the database (which is publicly available at tib.islandconservation.org) has been provided to dozens of researchers and conservationists and cited in 10 peer-reviewed articles. The data are being used in global island conservation assessments, evaluations of the impact of invasives on native species and human health, and measures of conservation successes [for example, the studies of Dawson et al. (68), McCreless et al. (51), de Wit et al. (69), and Jones et al. (33)], underpinning ongoing efforts to identify the most important islands globally and regionally for eradicating invasive species to benefit threatened biodiversity. These interventions will likely also benefit less well-studied taxa, such as plants and terrestrial invertebrates, many of which are concentrated on the same islands as highly threatened vertebrates and are susceptible to invasive species (9, 28).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Threatened vertebrates on islands We created the Threatened Island Biodiversity Database (37), which contains data on the island distribution of highly threatened terrestrial species of amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals recognized by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (version 2013). Seabirds breeding on islands were included, but marine mammals and sea turtles were excluded because of the broad global distribution of many of these species’ breeding sites. We downloaded all vertebrate taxa assessed as critically endangered or endangered, then identified those that breed on islands or on both islands and continents. With this list, we followed a systematic review to identify each island with a breeding population of a highly threatened vertebrate species (a species breeding on an island was considered a single population), documenting the present (1990 to 2015, when the data collection process was concluded) and historic (<1990 to 1500 A.D.) breeding status for each population on each island, followed by a review of the data by more than 500 experts (fig. S1 and table S1). Island biogeography We linked each island with an extant breeding population of a threatened vertebrate to the global island database (8) via a unique identification number and spatial reference for each island. This data set provided coordinates, island size (km2), and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) alpha-2 codes for each island, country, or territory. Islands ranged in size from 0.00001 km2 (offshore rocks) to 773,848 km2 (New Guinea). To place these islands into a biogeographic context that can be applied to strategizing conservation of threatened island species, we supplemented the data set with the following metrics downloaded from global online databases: marine ecoregions (70), terrestrial biomes and realms (71), and GDP per capita (72) and as income groups (73). We subsequently compared the distributions of island attributes between the islands with and without highly threatened vertebrates using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for continuous variables (for example, island size) and Pearson χ2 tests for ordinal data (for example, ecoregion). People and invasive vertebrates on islands The presence of human populations on islands plays a significant role in extinction risk for native species (51). Human settlements are associated with major drivers of extinctions and endangerment, including the transport and maintenance of invasive species on islands (43). The presence and relative density of people on islands and the types of invasive species present are important determinants of the strategies available for managing invasive species (46, 54). We conducted a systematic review of the literature and online databases to document the distribution and number of invasive vertebrate species and human inhabitants on islands. With this information, we examined how many islands with invasive vertebrates were either uninhabited or minimally inhabited by people to understand the potential scope of conservation opportunities on islands that would be the most simple to achieve. To identify the presence or absence of people on islands, we referred to human censuses data (through 2014) in government reports, literature, and websites (for example, Wikipedia, tourism websites, and travel blogs). When this was not available, we contacted local experts. Because not all islands had detailed data on the number of human inhabitants, we pooled human population sizes into ordinal categories of 0, 1 to 100, 101 to 1000, 1001 to 10,000, >10,000, or not found. To identify the presence or absence of terrestrial non-native alien vertebrates (hereafter, invasive vertebrates) on islands, we conducted a systematic review of the literature, websites, databases [for example, the Global Invasive Species Database (74)], and expert advice (fig. S2). We focused on non-native terrestrial vertebrates, defined as some of the most damaging terrestrial invaders (75), whose introduction spreads outside their natural range, and which are documented as negatively affecting native terrestrial vertebrates on islands (33, 76). We identified each invasive to the species level when possible or to the most specific taxonomic group possible, then grouped them as: amphibian, reptile (subgroup: snake, turtle, large reptile, and small reptile), mammal [subgroup: cat, dog, rat (Rattus), mouse (Mus), rabbit/hare, mongoose/weasel, primate, raccoon, ungulate, and other], and bird (subgroup: raptor and nonraptor; tables S3 and S4). For each island, invasive vertebrate presence was defined as present, absent, or unknown. Islands were considered to have invasive vertebrates if they were confirmed or suspected to be present or if there was an ongoing eradication (table S2). We did not investigate the impacts of these invasive groups, but we described their co-occurrence on islands with highly threatened vertebrates.

A birthday party with banners, balloons, party hats and a cake was thrown at Cleethorpes Zoo for one of its oldest residents.

Rhinoceros Iguana, Rhino, has been well and truly spoilt on his 21st birthday by the loving staff at The Jungle Zoo in Cleethorpes.

There was no holding back when it came to celebrating Rhino's special day, as zoo keepers rolled out all of the trimmings and sang happy birthday to the placid reptile.

Rhino, who has lived at Cleethorpes Zoo for 13 years, was cooked up a portion of his favourite meal - banana on a bed of greens - as a substitute for a calorific chocolate or jam-centre cake.

A Caribbean island native who can live well into his late 20s, Rhino's favourite foods are grapes and bananas, but he is only allowed to indulge in such delights on special occasions.

And today certainly was one of those.

(Image: Rick Byrne)

The Jungle Zoo assistant manager, Lindsey Hollingsworth, made sure that it was a day to remember for Rhino by serenading him with her version of 'happy birthday to you'.

Lindsey explained how Rhino is allowed to roam around the zoo walkways as he pleases, and is a big hit with visitors.

She said: ""He is very popular. Whenever people come they always remember Rhino.

""He's even target trained and will even move to where we tell him to. But that's only if we bribe him with grapes.

""He's very friendly with everyone that he meets. He used to live with a young family so is used to having lots of people around him.""

0,"To mark Wallacea Week, a series of public lectures and exhibition on the Wallacea region of Indonesia, The Conversation presents a series of analysis on biodiversity and history of science in Indonesia. This is the first article of the series.

The central islands of Indonesia - between Java, Bali and Kalimantan (also known as Borneo) on the west and Papua at the eastern end of the country - is a place of wonder, a living laboratory for the study of evolution.

It’s called Wallacea, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, the 19th century English explorer and naturalist. On his exploration in the Indonesian archipelago (then known as the Malay archipelago) Wallace developed his theory of natural selection.

He noticed that the islands of Kalimantan and Sulawesi as well as Bali and Lombok have very distinct animals even though the islands are next to each other. He proposed an invisible line runs between Kalimantan and Sulawesi and Bali and Lombok separating the faunas.

In Kalimantan and Bali live animals such as tiger, rhinos and elephants, which now, due to human population expansion, are endangered. In Sulawesi and Lombok to the east of the small Mollucas islands, we find marsupials, a variety of peculiar looking monkeys, and interesting endemic animals. Endemic animals means they are native or restricted to an area.

The invisible line is now known as Wallace’s Line and the region between it and the island of New Guinea has come to be called Wallacea.

Scientists today know that Kalimantan and Bali were connected as part of Sundaland, a large landmass that includes the Malay Peninsula on the Asian mainland as well as Java and Sumatra. This landmass was exposed for 2.6 million years until ice caps started to melt around 14,000 years ago, submerging part of the landmass and creating the Indonesian archipelago.

Creatures of Wallacea

Wallacea includes the large island of Sulawesi, the Mollucas - the various small to medium-sized islands to the east of Sulawesi and the “Banda Arc” islands - and the Lesser Sundas or Nusa Tenggara, south of Sulawesi and the Moluccas.

Wallacea is a transition zone between the great Indo-Malayan and Australasian biogeographical realms. Millions of years of relative geographical isolation have allowed fascinating and highly endemic fauna to evolve here.

Wallacea is home to 697 bird species, of which 249 (36%) are endemic. The rate of endemism rises to a more impressive 44% if only the resident birds, or those that don’t migrate, are considered.

On Sulawesi and its satellite islands, there are 328 bird species, 230 of them resident and 97 species are endemic, among them the maleo bird.

Wallacea has a total of 201 native mammal species (excluding whales and dolphins), 123 of which are endemic. If we exclude the 81 bat species with their greater capacity for dispersion, the rate of endemism increases to a very high 93%.

Sulawesi, the largest island in Wallacea, has the highest number of mammals, with 132 species, of which 83 (63%) are endemic.

It holds important flagship species such as the anoas (Bubalus depressicornis), diminutive buffaloes that live in the forests of Sulawesi, and the babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa), an unusual, enigmatic pig with long, recurved upper tusks that penetrate through the skin of the upper lip.

Sulawesi’s primates are also special. At least seven species of macaques are unique to the island. Sulawesi also has several species of tarsiers - tiny, goggle-eyed creatures that look more like mammalian tree frogs than monkeys.

Reptile diversity is also quite high, with 188 species, of which 122 (65%) are endemic. The best known reptile in Wallacea, and one of Indonesia’s most famous species, is the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) or “ora” in local language.

Komodo is the heaviest lizard in the world (males can reach about 2.8 m in length and weigh about 50 kg). They live only in the tiny island of Komodo, the neighbouring islands of Padar and Rinca to the west, and the western end and north coast of Flores.

Most of the 210 freshwater fish species recorded from the rivers and lakes in Wallacea are tolerant of both fresh and salt water to some extent.

We still need more research in fish species. In the Moluccas and Lesser Sundas, the fish fauna is poorly known. But there appear to be around six island endemics. On Sulawesi, there are 69 known species, of which 53 (77%) are endemic.

At the northeastern corner of South Sulawesi lies the Malili Lakes, a complex of deep lakes, rapids and rivers. Here, at least 15 endemic beautiful telmatherinid fishes have evolved.

The plants of Wallacea is not as well known as that of its neighbours. Fewer botanical specimens per-unit-area are collected than on any other major islands in Indonesia.

We also don’t know much of the invertebrate fauna of Wallacea. However, some groups, such as the enormous birdwing butterflies are better known.

Wallacea also has the world’s largest bee (Chalocodoma pluto) in the northern Moluccas. The females can grow to 4 cm in length. They are also remarkable because they nest communally in inhabited termite nests in lowland forest trees.

Human impact

As elsewhere, things have changed dramatically in Wallacea during the course of the past century. The human population has nearly quadrupled. Development has grown tremendously in Indonesia in general.

The first commercial logging operation in Wallacea began in the early part of the century, and forests have been cleared for agricultural programs, for industrial timber plantations, and for land settlement schemes that resettled hundreds of thousands of people from densely populated Java to other less inhabited (but much less productive) corners of Indonesia.

This has greatly reduced the amount of forest habitat, particularly in the lowlands, and has caused dramatic and severe declines in the populations of many forest species (many as much as 90%).

Much of the remaining forest is now given out in timber concessions of various kinds.

Furthermore, forest and land fires continues to be a problem. It is now greatly exacerbated by increased drying because of logging and plantation agriculture, and sometimes by intentional burning as well.

Overall, about 45% of Wallacea still has some forest cover; however, if one considers forest that is still in more or less pristine condition, the percentage drops to only 15%, or about 50,774 square kilometer.

At this point in time, forest protection in Wallacea is moderate at best. Protected area coverage is around 24,387 square kilometer, or 7% of original extent.

Of course, establishment of protected areas is only a beginning. Once created, they need management and the cooperation of local people, the government, and the private sector in order to be successful in conserving biodiversity. For millions of years, fascinating creatures have managed to diversify and evolve over millions of years. We have a moral obligation to protect this wonder.",Wallacea: a living laboratory of evolution,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS93YWxsYWNlYS1hLWxpdmluZy1sYWJvcmF0b3J5LW9mLWV2b2x1dGlvbi04NTYwMtIBT2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlY29udmVyc2F0aW9uLmNvbS9hbXAvd2FsbGFjZWEtYS1saXZpbmctbGFib3JhdG9yeS1vZi1ldm9sdXRpb24tODU2MDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images.theconversation.com/files/190257/original/file-20171015-3532-1ls3sq5.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&rect=0%2C304%2C4518%2C2259&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,2017-10-15,"{'sent': 'To mark Wallacea Week, a series of public lectures and exhibition on the Wallacea region of Indonesia, The Conversation presents a series of analysis on biodiversity and history of science in Indonesia.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Wallacea Week'], 'GPE': ['Indonesia']}}","To mark Wallacea Week, a series of public lectures and exhibition on the Wallacea region of Indonesia, The Conversation presents a series of analysis on biodiversity and history of science in Indonesia.

It holds important flagship species such as the anoas (Bubalus depressicornis), diminutive buffaloes that live in the forests of Sulawesi, and the babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa), an unusual, enigmatic pig with long, recurved upper tusks that penetrate through the skin of the upper lip.

Sulawesi’s primates are also special. At least seven species of macaques are unique to the island. Sulawesi also has several species of tarsiers - tiny, goggle-eyed creatures that look more like mammalian tree frogs than monkeys.

Reptile diversity is also quite high, with 188 species, of which 122 (65%) are endemic. The best known reptile in Wallacea, and one of Indonesia’s most famous species, is the Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) or “ora” in local language.

Komodo is the heaviest lizard in the world (males can reach about 2.8 m in length and weigh about 50 kg). They live only in the tiny island of Komodo, the neighbouring islands of Padar and Rinca to the west, and the western end and north coast of Flores.

Most of the 210 freshwater fish species recorded from the rivers and lakes in Wallacea are tolerant of both fresh and salt water to some extent.

We still need more research in fish species. In the Moluccas and Lesser Sundas, the fish fauna is poorly known. But there appear to be around six island endemics. On Sulawesi, there are 69 known species, of which 53 (77%) are endemic.

At the northeastern corner of South Sulawesi lies the Malili Lakes, a complex of deep lakes, rapids and rivers. Here, at least 15 endemic beautiful telmatherinid fishes have evolved.

The plants of Wallacea is not as well known as that of its neighbours. Fewer botanical specimens per-unit-area are collected than on any other major islands in Indonesia.

We also don’t know much of the invertebrate fauna of Wallacea. However, some groups, such as the enormous birdwing butterflies are better known.

Wallacea also has the world’s largest bee (Chalocodoma pluto) in the northern Moluccas. The females can grow to 4 cm in length. They are also remarkable because they nest communally in inhabited termite nests in lowland forest trees.

Human impact

As elsewhere, things have changed dramatically in Wallacea during the course of the past century. The human population has nearly quadrupled. Development has grown tremendously in Indonesia in general.

The first commercial logging operation in Wallacea began in the early part of the century, and forests have been cleared for agricultural programs, for industrial timber plantations, and for land settlement schemes that resettled hundreds of thousands of people from densely populated Java to other less inhabited (but much less productive) corners of Indonesia.

This has greatly reduced the amount of forest habitat, particularly in the lowlands, and has caused dramatic and severe declines in the populations of many forest species (many as much as 90%).

Much of the remaining forest is now given out in timber concessions of various kinds.

Furthermore, forest and land fires continues to be a problem. It is now greatly exacerbated by increased drying because of logging and plantation agriculture, and sometimes by intentional burning as well.

Overall, about 45% of Wallacea still has some forest cover; however, if one considers forest that is still in more or less pristine condition, the percentage drops to only 15%, or about 50,774 square kilometer.

At this point in time, forest protection in Wallacea is moderate at best. Protected area coverage is around 24,387 square kilometer, or 7% of original extent.

Of course, establishment of protected areas is only a beginning. Once created, they need management and the cooperation of local people, the government, and the private sector in order to be successful in conserving biodiversity. For millions of years, fascinating creatures have managed to diversify and evolve over millions of years. We have a moral obligation to protect this wonder.","[{'ORG', 'Wallacea Week'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'Indonesia', 'GPE'}, {'Indonesia', 'GPE'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'Indonesia', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Java'}, {'PERSON', 'Bali'}, {'PERSON', 'Kalimantan'}, {'PERSON', 'Borneo'}, {'PERSON', 'Papua'}, {'Wallacea', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Alfred Russel Wallace'}, {'DATE', 'the 19th century'}, {'LANGUAGE', 'English'}, {'the Indonesian archipelago', 'LOC'}, {'NORP', 'Malay'}, {'Wallace', 'PERSON'}, {'Kalimantan', 'GPE'}, {'Sulawesi', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Bali'}, {'PERSON', 'Lombok'}, {'Kalimantan', 'GPE'}, {'Sulawesi', 'GPE'}, {'Bali', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Lombok'}, {'Kalimantan', 'GPE'}, {'Bali', 'GPE'}, {'Sulawesi', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Lombok'}, {'Mollucas', 'ORG'}, {'Wallace’s Line', 'ORG'}, {'New Guinea', 'GPE'}, {'Wallacea', 'ORG'}, {'today', 'DATE'}, {'Kalimantan', 'GPE'}, {'Bali', 'GPE'}, {'Sundaland', 'GPE'}, {'Asian', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Java'}, {'PERSON', 'Sumatra'}, {'DATE', '2.6 million years'}, {'DATE', 'around 14,000 years ago'}, {'Indonesian', 'NORP'}, {'Sulawesi', 'GPE'}, {'Mollucas', 'ORG'}, {'Sulawesi', 'GPE'}, {'Nusa Tenggara', 'PERSON'}, {'Sulawesi', 'GPE'}, {'Moluccas', 'GPE'}, {'Wallacea', 'ORG'}, {'Australasian', 'NORP'}, {'DATE', 'Millions of years'}, {'CARDINAL', '697'}, {'CARDINAL', '249'}, {'36%', 'PERCENT'}, {'44%', 'PERCENT'}, {'Sulawesi', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', '328'}, {'CARDINAL', '230'}, {'CARDINAL', '97'}, {'Wallacea', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', '201'}, {'CARDINAL', '123'}, {'CARDINAL', '81'}, {'93%', 'PERCENT'}, {'Sulawesi', 'ORG'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'CARDINAL', '132'}, {'CARDINAL', '83'}, {'63%', 'PERCENT'}, {'Sulawesi', 'ORG'}, {'Sulawesi’s', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', 'At least seven'}, {'Sulawesi', 'ORG'}, {'188', 'CARDINAL'}, {'122', 'CARDINAL'}, {'PERCENT', '65%'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'Indonesia', 'GPE'}, {'Komodo', 'NORP'}, {'CARDINAL', 'about 2.8'}, {'QUANTITY', 'about 50 kg'}, {'Komodo', 'GPE'}, {'Padar', 'ORG'}, {'Rinca', 'ORG'}, {'Flores', 'ORG'}, {'Reuters', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Phil Noble'}, {'CARDINAL', '210'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'Moluccas', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Lesser Sundas'}, {'six', 'CARDINAL'}, {'Sulawesi', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', '69'}, {'CARDINAL', '53'}, {'77%', 'PERCENT'}, {'South Sulawesi', 'NORP'}, {'CARDINAL', 'at least 15'}, {'PERSON', 'telmatherinid'}, {'Wallacea', 'ORG'}, {'Indonesia', 'GPE'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'Wallacea', 'ORG'}, {'Chalocodoma', 'ORG'}, {'Moluccas', 'GPE'}, {'QUANTITY', '4 cm'}, {'lowland', 'GPE'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'the past century'}, {'Indonesia', 'GPE'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'the century'}, {'CARDINAL', 'hundreds of thousands'}, {'PERSON', 'Java'}, {'Indonesia', 'GPE'}, {'as much as 90%', 'PERCENT'}, {'about 45%', 'PERCENT'}, {'Wallacea', 'ORG'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'PERCENT', 'only 15%'}, {'QUANTITY', 'about 50,774 square kilometer'}, {'Wallacea', 'GPE'}, {'QUANTITY', 'around 24,387 square kilometer'}, {'7%', 'PERCENT'}, {'DATE', 'millions of years'}, {'DATE', 'millions of years'}]","['Wallacea Week', 'Wallacea', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia', 'Indonesia', 'Wallacea', 'the Indonesian archipelago', 'Malay', 'Kalimantan', 'Sulawesi', 'Kalimantan', 'Sulawesi', 'Bali', 'Kalimantan', 'Bali', 'Sulawesi', 'Mollucas', 'Wallace’s Line', 'New Guinea', 'Wallacea', 'Kalimantan', 'Bali', 'Sundaland', 'Asian', 'Indonesian', 'Sulawesi', 'Mollucas', 'Sulawesi', 'Sulawesi', 'Moluccas', 'Wallacea', 'Australasian', 'Sulawesi', 'Wallacea', 'Sulawesi', 'Wallacea', 'Sulawesi', 'Sulawesi’s', 'Sulawesi', 'Wallacea', 'Indonesia', 'Komodo', 'Komodo', 'Padar', 'Rinca', 'Flores', 'Reuters', 'Wallacea', 'Moluccas', 'Sulawesi', 'South Sulawesi', 'Wallacea', 'Indonesia', 'Wallacea', 'Wallacea', 'Chalocodoma', 'Moluccas', 'lowland', 'Wallacea', 'Indonesia', 'Wallacea', 'Indonesia', 'Wallacea', 'Wallacea']"

Let's take a look at some examples of how this has been playing out across America this month…

Homeland Security Helps Nab Woman for Unauthorized Massage

In Suffolk County, New York, police just raided an Asian spa based on the neighbors' suspicions. The Wednesday raid—a joint operation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Suffolk County Police, and the Town of Islip Fire Marshal—led to one 54-year-old woman being arrested and charged with prostitution, a misdemeanor under New York law, and ""Unauthorized Practice of a Profession,"" a felony. She is currently being held in county jail.

Year-Long Yoshiko Therapy Case Leads to One Misdemeanor Arrest

Colorado cops spent a year investigating Yoshiko Therapy after seeing an ad for the place on Backpage. Their rationale, according to The Denver Post, was that Backpage is ""a website known to be used for prostitution"" and the ad mentioned ""young and new girls."" The FBI-assisted operation led to the Wednesday arrest of one woman, age 43, on two misdemeanor charges: pandering and keeping a place of prostitution.

5-Month Investigation Into Nude Masseuse

Phoenix police spent five months investigating a middle-aged woman under suspicion of offering sensual massages from her home. The 46-year-old was arrested in early October, but police began the investigation in May. During this period, undercover cops visited her multiple times for nude massages, at $140–$160 per session, according to ABC15 Arizona. She allegedly offered to engage in unspecified sexual activity beyond that for an extra fee, which they declined.

With all this effort, they must have been on to something more, right? Enslaved masseuses in her basement? Mafia ties? Something? Nope, just a lady offering massages with a little extra to grown men who sought out her services. The only victim police allege in this case is a customer who left because she ""scared"" him when she entered the massage room naked.

The woman is charged with two counts of maintaining a house of prostitution, one count of prostitution, and one charge of manifesting an intent to commit prostitution.

Aiding and Abetting an Unlicensed Massage

In the Illinois city of Oswego, a ""long term investigation"" into one local spa led to this Wednesday's takedown of two middle-aged Chinese women. One was charged with prostitution and unlicensed massage, both misdemeanors. The other—a state-licensed massage therapist—was charged with aiding and abetting an unlicensed massage.

The two women were let out on bonds of $1,500 apiece and are due in court in November. The business was also cited for an occupancy-code violation, and its permit has been suspended.

Landlords Pay When S.F. Masseuses Violate Rules

In San Francisco, city prosecutors have been suing massage parlors out of business if workers there are arrested on prostitution charges. Landlords of the buildings where they operate are also be sued and fined.

In a recent settlement involving Queen's Health Center, massage-parlor owner Jie Qin Zhou was required to pay $195,000 to the city and is permanently forbidden from opening any other service-oriented business in San Francisco. The landlord of the building where Zhou's massage business was located must pay the city $100,000 and cannot rent to another massage parlor or similar business for 10 years.

Now the city is suing another massage parlor where undercover stings have uncovered prostitution. ""The lawsuit asks the court to close the business, sell off its fixtures, grant an injunction against both the property and business owners and levy monetary penalties,"" explains KCBS.

Stamping Out Inadequate Signage

The California city of Hemet recently went fishing for evidence of prostitution or human trafficking at the city's massage parlors. Finding instead small businesses operating exactly as advertised, code-compliance cops issued 44 violations for things like inadequate signage and unpermitted construction.

Rockford Wants a Cut of Masseuse Profits

The city of Rockford, Illinois, found no evidence of human trafficking or prostitution at two local massage parlors but shuttered them anyway.

The city says it shut them down for operating without a state license to provide massage services and for a building-code violation.

Alderman Jonathan Logemann is now proposing that all Rockford massage businesses must get a city license, too, at an annual cost of $300. Logemann would also require anyone giving massages in Rockford to have been trained in Illinois and to pay for a state massage therapy license.

A six-week operation in Fresno, California, led to a sheriff's office raid on Angels massage parlor this week. Neighbors said they never noticed anything unusual about the business and that it had not been a nuisance.

0,"After six days of intense negotiations, the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS COP12) adopted on Saturday actions to protect a wide range of migratory species.

“An intensive week of negotiations have resulted in a stronger commitment by countries to stepping up their efforts to conserve the planet’s migratory wildlife,” Bradnee Chambers, the convention’s executive secretary said, adding that the outcome of the Manila conference “has been a real game changer for the convention”.

Chambers said the convention now has “compliance review mechanism and has adopted species that test the boundaries of international wildlife conservation.”

The week-long CMS COP12 ended on Saturday with decisions on 34 species in submissions made by 24 parties from Asia, Africa, the Americas, Europe and Oceania, according to Chambers.

These include actions on Africa’s great carnivores, 10 species of vulture, and the endangered Whale Shark, known as the “butanding” in the Philippines, he said.

Over 1,000 delegates representing more than 100 parties and non-parties representing every region of the world attended this year’s meeting. It marked the first time the summit had been held in Asia.

Moreover, he said the governments also agreed to cooperate on reducing the negative impacts of marine debris, noise pollution, renewable energy and climate change on migratory species.

The CMS COP12 forum took place in the Philippine capital from Monday to Saturday under the theme “Their Future is Our Future – Sustainable Development for Wildlife & People.”

Chambers said this year’s theme contributed to a growing global awareness of the importance of nature to human’s well-being and the multiple connections between wildlife and people.

“It has helped to convey the message that the future of migratory wildlife is integral to our own future and that we all have the responsibility to act. Agreements made at CMS COP12 have firmly underlined this important message,” he said.

Chambers said the governments also agreed to protect three species of shark and three species of ray, including the angel shark, the dusky shark, the blue shark, the common guitarfish and the white-spotted wedge fish.

He said all avian species have also been included in the list of birds that need to be protected, including the steppe eagle, four species of Asian vulture, five sub-Saharan vulture species, the Lappet-faced Vulture and the Christmas Frigatebird. A subspecies of the Black Noddy, the Yellow Bunting and the Lesser and Great Grey Shrike are also now in the leis, he added.

For the first time, he said the giraffe will receive protection under an international treaty. “Although populations in many Southern African countries are thriving, they are in overall decline across Africa with less than 90,000 animals remaining in the wild,” he said.

He said the leopard and lion will also be listed, paving the way for a joint initiative on protecting Africa’s great carnivores.

“The African Carnivores Initiative will become a focal point for the implementation of resolutions and decisions on lions, leopards, cheetahs and wild dogs under CMS and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES),” Chambers said.

He said the chimpanzee is now listed on the CMS list. “Humans’ closest relative is facing a 50 percent drop in numbers over three generations and rapid habitat loss, especially in the western and eastern parts of its historic range,” he said.

Also included are the near-extinct Gobi Bear, he said, adding that only 45 individuals of the Gobi subspecies of the Brown Bear remain in the wild, shared between Mongolia and China.

He said the Caspian Seal is included in the CMS list now. “It is the only marine mammal found in the world’s largest inland sea, where its migration is prompted by ice formation and foraging,” he said.

Other mammals that will benefit from the additional protection include the African Wild Ass – the most endangered wild equid in the world, Przewalski’s Horse and four species of Lasiurus Bat, he said.

However, Chambers said the proposal to add the Chinkara (Indian Gazelle) was withdrawn.

Unusually for a CMS COP, he said the consensus was not reached on four species proposals, which went to a vote. “Listing of the chimpanzee, giraffe, leopard and lion was approved by a wide majority at the Committee stage,” Chambers said.

In total, 12 mammals were afforded greater protection under CMS, 16 birds and six species of fish.

Theresa Mundita Lim, director of the Philippines’ Biodiversity and Management Bureau, said that the agreements reached in the meeting are significant.

“Migratory animals play a critical role in our planet’s ecosystem. They act as pollinators, control pests and are a source of food and income. They are also an inspiration for people here in the Philippines and all around the world,” Lim said.

“We will put in place the necessary national measures to integrate the conservation and protection of migratory wildlife species into our development planning processes and we will engage all sectors of society in crafting these measures,” Lim said.

Other agreements reached include the formation of a new intergovernmental task force to curb the illegal killing of birds crossing the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, which spans 22 countries; a conservation roadmap for the critically endangered African Wild Ass, with fewer than 70 animals remaining in the wild; and a Vulture Multi-Species Action Plan to better protect 15 species of Old World Vulture in more than 120 countries.

The meeting also reached a consensus on CMS guidelines on assessing impacts of marine noise activities; expanding the Convention’s work on preventing the poisoning of birds with a particular focus on the effects of lead; and an action on aquatic wild meat, which is fast becoming a conservation problem on a scale similar to that of terrestrial bushmeat.

The CMS COP12 in Manila has been the largest-ever meeting in the 38-year history of the convention, which is also known as the “Bonn Convention” after the German city where it was signed.

Chambers said the Manila meeting has broken all records as the biggest COP in the history of CMS, with the highest number of attendees from parties, non-parties and non-governmental organizations, with a record number of proposals accepted.

These include actions on Africa’s great carnivores, 10 species of vulture, and the endangered Whale Shark, known as the “butanding” in the Philippines, he said.

Over 1,000 delegates representing more than 100 parties and non-parties representing every region of the world attended this year’s meeting. It marked the first time the summit had been held in Asia.

Moreover, he said the governments also agreed to cooperate on reducing the negative impacts of marine debris, noise pollution, renewable energy and climate change on migratory species.

The CMS COP12 forum took place in the Philippine capital from Monday to Saturday under the theme “Their Future is Our Future – Sustainable Development for Wildlife & People.”

Chambers said this year’s theme contributed to a growing global awareness of the importance of nature to human’s well-being and the multiple connections between wildlife and people.

“It has helped to convey the message that the future of migratory wildlife is integral to our own future and that we all have the responsibility to act. Agreements made at CMS COP12 have firmly underlined this important message,” he said.

Chambers said the governments also agreed to protect three species of shark and three species of ray, including the angel shark, the dusky shark, the blue shark, the common guitarfish and the white-spotted wedge fish.

He said all avian species have also been included in the list of birds that need to be protected, including the steppe eagle, four species of Asian vulture, five sub-Saharan vulture species, the Lappet-faced Vulture and the Christmas Frigatebird. A subspecies of the Black Noddy, the Yellow Bunting and the Lesser and Great Grey Shrike are also now in the leis, he added.

For the first time, he said the giraffe will receive protection under an international treaty. “Although populations in many Southern African countries are thriving, they are in overall decline across Africa with less than 90,000 animals remaining in the wild,” he said.

He said the leopard and lion will also be listed, paving the way for a joint initiative on protecting Africa’s great carnivores.

“The African Carnivores Initiative will become a focal point for the implementation of resolutions and decisions on lions, leopards, cheetahs and wild dogs under CMS and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES),” Chambers said.

He said the chimpanzee is now listed on the CMS list. “Humans’ closest relative is facing a 50 percent drop in numbers over three generations and rapid habitat loss, especially in the western and eastern parts of its historic range,” he said.

Also included are the near-extinct Gobi Bear, he said, adding that only 45 individuals of the Gobi subspecies of the Brown Bear remain in the wild, shared between Mongolia and China.

He said the Caspian Seal is included in the CMS list now. “It is the only marine mammal found in the world’s largest inland sea, where its migration is prompted by ice formation and foraging,” he said.

Other mammals that will benefit from the additional protection include the African Wild Ass – the most endangered wild equid in the world, Przewalski’s Horse and four species of Lasiurus Bat, he said.

However, Chambers said the proposal to add the Chinkara (Indian Gazelle) was withdrawn.

Unusually for a CMS COP, he said the consensus was not reached on four species proposals, which went to a vote. “Listing of the chimpanzee, giraffe, leopard and lion was approved by a wide majority at the Committee stage,” Chambers said.

In total, 12 mammals were afforded greater protection under CMS, 16 birds and six species of fish.

Theresa Mundita Lim, director of the Philippines’ Biodiversity and Management Bureau, said that the agreements reached in the meeting are significant.

“Migratory animals play a critical role in our planet’s ecosystem. They act as pollinators, control pests and are a source of food and income. They are also an inspiration for people here in the Philippines and all around the world,” Lim said.

“We will put in place the necessary national measures to integrate the conservation and protection of migratory wildlife species into our development planning processes and we will engage all sectors of society in crafting these measures,” Lim said.

Other agreements reached include the formation of a new intergovernmental task force to curb the illegal killing of birds crossing the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, which spans 22 countries; a conservation roadmap for the critically endangered African Wild Ass, with fewer than 70 animals remaining in the wild; and a Vulture Multi-Species Action Plan to better protect 15 species of Old World Vulture in more than 120 countries.

The meeting also reached a consensus on CMS guidelines on assessing impacts of marine noise activities; expanding the Convention’s work on preventing the poisoning of birds with a particular focus on the effects of lead; and an action on aquatic wild meat, which is fast becoming a conservation problem on a scale similar to that of terrestrial bushmeat.

The CMS COP12 in Manila has been the largest-ever meeting in the 38-year history of the convention, which is also known as the “Bonn Convention” after the German city where it was signed.

Chambers said the Manila meeting has broken all records as the biggest COP in the history of CMS, with the highest number of attendees from parties, non-parties and non-governmental organizations, with a record number of proposals accepted.

The Critically Endangered Ricord’s Iguana and the Vulnerable Rhinoceros Iguana can once again thrive on Cabritos Island, Dominican Republic after the successful removal of a suite of invasive species.

After extensive monitoring by a team of international organizations, , SOH Conservation, and Island Conservation confirmed Cabritos Island’s native iguanas are poised for recovery following the successful removal of introduced, damaging (invasive) donkeys, feral cats, and cows from the island. The effort began in 2013 with the training of a local field team in island restoration techniques. Since then, the Critically Endangered[1] Ricord’s and Vulnerable Rhinoceros’ Iguanas have gone through multiple breeding seasons where the invasive species populations were greatly reduced or absent, and evidence of recovery is everywhere. Wesley Jolley, Cabritos Project Manager at Island Conservation said:

Today, the island is filled with juvenile iguanas scurrying about, a sight rarely seen when invasive species were present. Native vegetation is also thriving.

Now, Cabritos Island is the only place on Earth where the Critically Endangered Ricord’s Iguana can roam free from the threat of feral cats, donkeys and cows. These threatened iguanas survive as four populations, with three in the Southwest of the Dominican Republic and one in Haiti.

The Ricord’s Iguana and Rhinoceros Iguana are the only two rock iguanas that overlap in their natural range. Both species are declining in the Caribbean due to invasive species and habitat loss. For years, invasive species, including feral cats and donkeys, on Cabritos Island threatened iguana populations by eating young iguanas, destroying nests, competing for food, and damaging critical habitat.

Watch the video

To protect the endangered iguanas, the Ministry of the Environment of the Dominican Republic began efforts in 2010 to remove these invasive species from Cabritos Island. Non-governmental organizations Island Conservation and SOH Conservation joined the project in 2013 with the support of local organizations Grupo Jaragua and the Lake Enriquillo Ecotourism Guides Association (AGELE, by its Spanish acronym). Engineer José Manuel Mateo Feliz, Director of Biodiversity, Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Dominican Republic said:

The restoration of Cabritos Island in the Dominican Republic is an ideal model for effective conservation projects in the Caribbean. Supported by strong alliances at local, regional and international levels, this project has generated great conservation results that will generate significant benefits for endemic and native species in the years to come. The local technical capacity has been strengthened and focused on the National Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Uses of Biodiversity and its Action Plan 2011-2020 prepared by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources of the Dominican Republic, which is aligned with the goals of Aichi.

One of the keys to success in this project creating, training, and supporting a local team of more than a dozen men from the Dominican Republic who completed the vast majority of the field work. The dedication of the local team to the project ensured that all invasive species were eliminated without presenting unnecessary risks or negative effects for native species. This model created local jobs and capabilities within the Dominican Republic for important conservation work. Jorge Brocca from SOH Conservation commented:

This project featured an excellent team of biologists and assistants, who are mostly from the rural communities of our country. By integrating with a trained team, we built capacity to restore islands in the Caribbean, thanks to Island Conservation. We also want thank our national and international donors without whom many of these efforts would not have been possible, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, United Nations Small Grants Program, Van Tienhoven Foundation, and the Iguana Foundation.

This project was logistically challenging and complex. Cabritos Island is approximately seven miles long (11.3 km) and one mile wide (1.6 km) and the camp is located at the west end. The team had to walk several miles each day or use a boat, which is extremely difficult when lake conditions are rough. To get around efficiently, the team disassembled an All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) and transported the parts by small boats to Cabritos Island, where it was re-assembled. This was no small feat.

Robert A. Ortiz, field coordinator for the project commented,

With the eradication of these invasive mammals, one of the most important negative impacts for natural biodiversity is removed, significantly reversing the environmental degradation initially observed on the island. It is motivating to observe the increase in the number of sightings of juvenile iguanas and other reptiles, such as smaller size lizards and snakes (first time recorded during the project), as well as the regeneration of vegetation cover that was affected by large herbivores. With adequate and strict compliance with biosafety protocols and measures, the survival of native species is guaranteed in the long term.

Ortiz also noted that the project results represent an invaluable precedent in the ecological restoration of islands at the local level, an admirable contribution that needs to be replicated in other islands of the country to continue to restore and preserve the biodiversity of Hispaniola.

New research reveals that nearly half the Earth’s highly threatened vertebrates live on islands and are endangered by invasive species. By removing or controlling invasive species on these islands, we can protect 41% of all threatened vertebrates worldwide and 95% of threatened island species. Once introduced to islands, invasive mammals represent key threats to native species through predation, competition and habitat loss. Invasive species are implicated in 86% of all island plant and vertebrate extinctions. The removal of invasive species from island ecosystems is a proven way to protect biodiversity and prevent extinctions. There have been nearly 900[2] successful invasive species removal projects on islands across the globe.

Funding for this project has been generously provided by the Global Environment Facility/Centre for Agriculture and Biosciences International, International Iguana Foundation, the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, Wallace Research Foundation, Van Teinhoven Foundation, US Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife Without Borders, United Nations Development Programme Small Grants Program, anonymous donors, and the many conservationists who supported the project via the Cabritos Island Restoration Project online campaign.

About Cabritos Island: Cabritos Island is a bit of a rarity, as it is an island within an island located in Lake Enriquillo, the largest lake and the lowest point of elevation in the Caribbean. The lake is in a valley between two high mountains created by the collision of two paleo islands that formerly constituted what is now Hispaniola Island. In fact, Cabritos Island is below sea level. This island and Lake Enriquillo constitute the Lake Enriquillo National Park, and Cabritos Island is the conservation core of the Jaragua-Bahoruco-Enriquillo Reserve of UNESCO; it is also part of the Massif de la Selle Corridor. About the partners: The is the agency responsible for designing, executing and overseeing national policy on environment and natural resources, and promoting and stimulating activities of preservation, protection, restoration and sustainable use. Island Conservation is our world’s only global, not-for-profit conservation organization whose mission is to prevent extinctions by removing invasive species from islands. We work where the concentration of both biodiversity and species extinction is greatest – islands. Removing a primary threat – introduced invasive vertebrates – is one of the most critical interventions for saving threatened plants and animals and restoring island ecosystems. Once invasive species are removed, native island species and ecosystems recover with little additional intervention. Since 1994, Island Conservation and partners have deployed teams to protect 994 populations of 389 species on 66 islands. IC is headquartered in Santa Cruz, CA with field offices in Australia, the Bahamas, British Columbia, Chile, Ecuador, Hawaii, New Zealand, Palau, and Puerto Rico.

SOH Conservación is a non-profit environmental organization dedicated to the conservation of endangered species and their habitats on the island of Hispaniola. Our mission is to create knowledge, value, respect, and protection for the conservation of the biodiversity of our island, through research, education, training and the strengthening of Protected Areas.

0,"Environment Secretary Roy A. Cimatu has created a special task force that will go after groups and individuals involved in wildlife trafficking, an official of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said.

Director Theresa Mundita S. Lim of the DENR’s Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) said the creation of the special task force is Cimatu’s response to rampant illegal-wildlife trade that continues to threaten the country’s endangered wildlife species.

There are already two other task forces that deal with environmental crimes, which include animal poaching or hunting of animal for subsistence, and illegal-wildlife trade that aims to profit from wildlife resources, before Cimatu’s current term.

These are the Philippine Operations Group on Ivory and Illegal Wildlife or Task Force Pogi created under former Environment Secretary Ramon J.P. Paje, a composite group of personnel deputized by the DENR’s BMB and officers of law-enforcement agencies like the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation, and the National Anti-Environmental Crime Task Force (NAECTF) created by former Environment Secretary Regina Paz L. Lopez. The NAECTF is an interagency body tasked to go after large-scale environmental crimes, which include wildlife trafficking.

At the closing news conference of the 12th Conference of Parties Meeting of the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS) of Wild Animals on October 28, Lim said under Cimatu’s watch as chief steward of the environment and natural resources, the DENR will continue its awareness campaign, while strengthening wildlife

law enforcement.

DENR Undersecretary for Field Operations (Luzon) Juan Miguel T. Cuna said Cimatu will make the formal announcement as to the name, composition and mission of the task force.

The Philippines has existing legislation that protect Philippine wildlife, including migratory species, including the Wildlife Act, the Caves Act and the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act (Nipas), against illegal- wildlife trade.

Animal poaching is a big problem even in supposedly protected areas under Nipas, as upland dwellers continue to hunt animals for subsistence; and for illegal-wildlife trade, it being a traditional source of income. Animals like snakes, birds, lizards and spiders are sold as pets, and are even exported by unscrupulous traders.

Illegal-wildlife trade also occurs in open seas, with local and foreign fishermen targeting endangered species like sharks and rays, including the butanding and marine turtles.

Sharks and rays are targeted for their meat and internal organs in Western Visayas and Bicol regions. They are traditionally cooked with coconut milk to produce kinunot, a local delicacy.

In Tawi-Tawi Province, host to the Turtle Island Wildlife Sanctuary and the biggest concentration of marine turtles that can be found in Southeast Asia, marine turtle population is on the decline because of hunting for meat, shells and their internal organs. People in communities in Tawi-Tawi also harvest the eggs of marine turtles.

Lim said the DENR continues to conduct awareness campaign about the importance of protecting and conserving the country’s endangered animal species, including migratory birds and marine animals, while strengthening law enforcement, arrest or apprehension of suspected traders, and prosecution.

“We continue to coordinate with the Judiciary to make sure that our campaign does not stop in the apprehension, but to make get conviction by the courts,”

she added.

The Philippines is the only country with special prosecutors and special courts that deal with environmental crimes.

During the international wildlife conference, a total of 34 proposals were approved, providing greater protection for 34 migratory species, including iconic animals like the lion, leopard, giraffe and chimpanzee.

Also called the Bonn Convention, the CMS is an international treaty that promotes the protection and conservation of migratory species, including their habitats.

During the convention, the Philippines, being the host of the meeting, successfully pushed greater protection for two sharks and three bird species.

These are the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), white-spotted wedgefish (Rhynchobatus australiae), Christmas frigatebird (Fregada andrewsi), block noddy (Anous minuitus) and the yellow bunting (Emberiza sulpurata).",DENR’s Cimatu forms task force vs wildlife traffickers,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NtaXJyb3IuY29tLnBoL2RlbnJzLWNpbWF0dS1mb3Jtcy10YXNrLWZvcmNlLXZzLXdpbGRsaWZlLXRyYWZmaWNrZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://businessmirror.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BM-logo-square2.jpg,2017-11-02,"{'sent': 'Environment Secretary Roy A.

Cimatu has created a special task force that will go after groups and individuals involved in wildlife trafficking, an official of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said.

Director Theresa Mundita S. Lim of the DENR’s Biodiversity Management Bureau (BMB) said the creation of the special task force is Cimatu’s response to rampant illegal-wildlife trade that continues to threaten the country’s endangered wildlife species.

There are already two other task forces that deal with environmental crimes, which include animal poaching or hunting of animal for subsistence, and illegal-wildlife trade that aims to profit from wildlife resources, before Cimatu’s current term.

These are the Philippine Operations Group on Ivory and Illegal Wildlife or Task Force Pogi created under former Environment Secretary Ramon J.P. Paje, a composite group of personnel deputized by the DENR’s BMB and officers of law-enforcement agencies like the Philippine National Police and the National Bureau of Investigation, and the National Anti-Environmental Crime Task Force (NAECTF) created by former Environment Secretary Regina Paz L. Lopez. The NAECTF is an interagency body tasked to go after large-scale environmental crimes, which include wildlife trafficking.

0,"A parrot that was left heartbroken after being taken into a rescue found the perfect way to cheer itself up — by swinging from a volunteer's hair.

Snowball, a white Goffin’s cockatoo, was taken in by Rhode Island Parrot Rescue after its owner was forced to give the bird up due to her declining health.

A volunteer at the rescue, Erica Collins, recalled that when Snowball arrived at the rescue, located in Warwick, R.I., “he was the saddest little thing” and “sat in his cage with his head down” for weeks.

Exotic birds are reportedly very intelligent and mourn the loss of people they are close to, but thankfully, Snowball found a way to cheer himself up.

In an online video, Snowball can be seen swinging happily from Collins’ ponytail, keeping at it for more than a minute while amused visitors look on.

""Out of the blue Snowball decided flew to my ponytail and just started swinging,” Collins told SWNS. “Once he had started, he kept doing it. I remember thinking, ‘He better not bite my bum!’”

The bird didn’t want to stop because he was having such a great time.

“It was hilarious,"" Collins added. ""It was a great moment. Everyone was laughing and was amused at how playful he was. He is very playful. He was behaving like a little kid.”

The rescue hopes that Snowball, who is 22 years old, will find a forever home soon.

0,"Over the past 10 years, the Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District has been a part of the Ohio Hellbender Partnership, an organization of private, state and federal entities that is trying to preserve the state endangered hellbender.

The hellbender is the largest native salamander found in North America and is found within the unglaciated ragged and worn hills of Appalachia and the Ozarks. Jefferson County and its citizens have an extensive and intertwined relationship with the hellbender (stone carvings of hellbenders by the Monongahela people dating to 600 BC were found in the Ohio River bed stone just north of Steubenville) that continues to this day.

It is altogether fitting and proper that one of the hellbender’s last strongholds in Ohio is in Jefferson County. For just as the hellbender struggles with adapting to changing times and forging its way in a different time, the people of Jefferson County continue to try and reinvent themselves and climb out of the dredges of the Rust Belt region and mentality, while retaining our character.

As part of the Ohio Hellbender Partnership, it is our goal to conserve, promote and reintroduce the hellbender throughout its native ranges in Ohio.

Raising awareness

A key element of that philosophy is educating the people about hellbenders and raising awareness of the animal and its environment. In order to promote the hellbender, the Ohio Division of Wildlife decided to allow six one-year-old hellbenders to be sent out to different agencies and wildlife centers throughout the state, to be put on display, and Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District was selected to be one of these inaugural locations.

On Aug. 24, we made the long drive from Steubenville to Findlay, Ohio, to pick up one of the first six baby hellbenders that were being handed out by the Ohio Division of Wildlife as part of an educational promotion to raise awareness of hellbenders.

We were the proud caretakers of a 5-inch little boy hellbender that was from an egg we collected out of Cross Creek in central Jefferson County. As crazy as it sounds, it was just like having a baby, as even though you were given care instructions and had everything prepared at home, once you got the little guy and started your journey home, everything you were prepped for and anticipated was going to happen went straight out the window.

Through the charity of Pet Supplies Plus, of Steubenville, we had a 55-gallon aquarium and all necessary accessories (filters, lids, oxygen supply) donated which was a huge cost savings.

However, the aquarium delivery was delayed, so we immediately dug out an old 20-gallon aquarium from the 1970s that had, fittingly, been to hell and back in appearance.

The house

We carved out a piece of sandstone we got from near where native hellbenders are located, to make a small den for our baby hellbender and got him in the aquarium.

We got distilled water and filled the aquarium to capacity and placed all of the oxygen stones before making a run to Pet Supplies Plus, to get him the food that was recommended by the zoo.

While we waited on the aquarium to be delivered, a local citizen heard we had just received the baby hellbender and donated us a 110-gallon aquarium to house him.

We went and retrieved the 6-foot long, 200-pound aquarium from the basement of the donor (carrying it up the steps), and got it to the office after barely fitting into the work jeep and cramming it into the elevator.

We filled the big aquarium with more stone and made another nest rock for him that was larger and moved him into his new digs. Very quickly everything went wrong. Our little calm hellbender that would hide under the rock all day soon was swimming around and pirouetting out of the water like Esther Williams — fear and panic gripped the office and we quickly got him back into his old aquarium where he happily settled in back under his rock.

We later determined that he did not have enough oxygen in the big tank as he requires around 85-90 percent dissolved oxygen in his water.

However, this great discovery wasn’t without its tribulation as we when we added too many oxygen stones to his aquarium he absorbed too much air and we nearly killed him.

At this point, we got his permanent aquarium installed in the boardroom of the Jefferson Soil and Water office while we tried to figure him out as the plan was to move him to the Steubenville Public Library.

Accessories

After we got him his new aquarium, we set him up with all of the amenities that a little hellbender could want with stone, stream simulators and a plethora of oxygen stones. However, once again things weren’t going well for our little hellbender.

The aquarium had a reflective bottom on it, so he was getting inundated with too much light causing him to freak out, which resulted in our October board meeting being held in nearly complete darkness.

We were able to close the blinds and get a small sediment layer built up on the aquarium to help appease his ever-increasing demands. As the weather cooled outside, our next great panic occurred. Our office building’s heat soon kicked on and our office temperature soon climbed into the mid-80s, which caused his water to skyrocket, putting his life in danger.

This led to fear and panic in the office, as we began quickly freezing water bottles and putting in his aquarium every day (including weekends) while we searched for an aquarium chiller. The chiller will regulate the temperature of the water and are quite costly and not carried by all pet stores.

During our search for a chiller, we contacted one pet store who insisted that we didn’t need one and as we explained we had a ‘wild’ salamander the clerk demanded that we return the hellbender to the stream immediately.

We were soon able to find one on Amazon and had it within four very long days. The next big hurdle that I discovered was that our little Goldilocks was not eating the food that the zoo recommended us feeding him.

His diet

He snubbed his nose to everything we offered him that was on his prescribed diet. Fear and panic set in as we are on the verge of killing him … again.

So, we tried to think rationally and went to the stream and kick-seined to see what was near the adult, native, wild hellbender population. We discovered that the majority of the potential menu items were hellgrammites, crayfish and stonefly larva.

So we soon went about obtaining these items to see if they would work for him. We set up another aquarium to house the living food, as has been proven successful by such entities as Red Lobster, and soon served him up a nice delicious hellgrammite.

As soon as the first hellgrammite hit the water, our little hellbender was out from underneath his rock and was on the active hunt. He soon had it and was devouring it as we watched and jumped up and down out of excitement for being successful in getting him to finally eat.

Our celebrations and high fives soon turned to … you guessed it … fear and panic as we watch him snatch up his second hellgrammite. Since the hellgrammites were nearly the size of him, we watched in horror as he began to swell up into a round little hot dog with four little legs.

We possibly killed him … again, from overfeeding him. For the next few hours, we were glued to the aquarium glass like a pleco suckerfish and were relieved as we noticed as he rocked from side to side that he was going to make it.

Watching him move

The next day we came into the office and rushed back to the boardroom to see his fate, and we were great perplexed as he walked around on his front legs as his back half floated along.

We soon discovered that overeating he had made him a bit gassy, which we kind of chuckled about until we learned that if he didn’t pass the gas, it could prove fatal.

So, for the next three days, we watched. … in fear and panic hoping we weren’t on the verge of killing him … again hoping he would pass his gas.

We never thought we would be happy about something passing gas in front of us, but when it happened it was high fives all around.

We are finally getting the hang of raising a baby hellbender, but we still have our adventures. There are times of humor such as when one of the crayfish escaped the food tank after climbing up the oxygen hose, claw-over-claw before base-jumping off the table and walking the 60 feet to our front doors before being stopped cold in his tracks by the lock on the door, which was out of his three-inch reach.

There are still times of fear and panic as our little hellbender does very unhellbenderish, things such as riding the water currents with a limp body and smile on his face to relieve the boredom and signify that he his hungry.

We are still hoping that we can move forward with our plans for grand unveiling for him versus planning his funeral arrangements.","Raising a hellbender is rough, but rewarding",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhcm1hbmRkYWlyeS5jb20vdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvcmFpc2luZy1hLWhlbGxiZW5kZXItaXMtcm91Z2gtYnV0LXJld2FyZGluZy80NTgyMDQuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://s3-wp-lyleprintingandp.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/23060015/16447529867_c132d6628e_h-e1511293290972.jpg,2017-11-24,"{'sent': 'Over the past 10 years, the Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District has been a part of the Ohio Hellbender Partnership, an organization of private, state and federal entities that is trying to preserve the state endangered hellbender.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['the Jefferson Soil'], 'ORG': ['the Ohio Hellbender Partnership']}}","Over the past 10 years, the Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District has been a part of the Ohio Hellbender Partnership, an organization of private, state and federal entities that is trying to preserve the state endangered hellbender.

We are still hoping that we can move forward with our plans for grand unveiling for him versus planning his funeral arrangements.","[{'DATE', 'the past 10 years'}, {'the Jefferson Soil', 'GPE'}, {'the Ohio Hellbender Partnership', 'ORG'}, {'North America', 'LOC'}, {'Appalachia', 'ORG'}, {'Ozarks', 'LOC'}, {'Jefferson County', 'GPE'}, {'Monongahela', 'GPE'}, {'CARDINAL', '600'}, {'BC', 'ORG'}, {'Ohio River', 'LOC'}, {'Steubenville', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', 'this day'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'Ohio', 'GPE'}, {'Jefferson County', 'GPE'}, {'Jefferson County', 'GPE'}, {'the Ohio Hellbender Partnership', 'ORG'}, {'Ohio', 'GPE'}, {'the Ohio Division of Wildlife', 'ORG'}, {'six', 'CARDINAL'}, {'DATE', 'one-year-old'}, {'PERSON', 'Jefferson Soil'}, {'DATE', 'Aug. 24'}, {'Steubenville to Findlay', 'GPE'}, {'Ohio', 'GPE'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'six', 'CARDINAL'}, {'the Ohio Division of Wildlife', 'ORG'}, {'QUANTITY', '5-inch'}, {'Cross Creek', 'GPE'}, {'Jefferson County', 'GPE'}, {'Steubenville', 'ORG'}, {'QUANTITY', '55-gallon'}, {'QUANTITY', '20-gallon'}, {'DATE', 'the 1970s'}, {'Pet Supplies Plus', 'ORG'}, {'QUANTITY', '110-gallon'}, {'QUANTITY', '6-foot'}, {'QUANTITY', '200-pound'}, {'PERSON', 'Esther Williams'}, {'the Jefferson Soil and Water', 'ORG'}, {'the Steubenville Public Library', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', 'October'}, {'DATE', 'the mid-80s'}, {'weekends', 'DATE'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'ORG', 'Amazon'}, {'DATE', 'four very long days'}, {'PERSON', 'Goldilocks'}, {'Red Lobster', 'GPE'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'ORDINAL', 'second'}, {'four', 'CARDINAL'}, {'the next few hours', 'DATE'}, {'DATE', 'The next day'}, {'CARDINAL', 'half'}, {'DATE', 'the next three days'}, {'QUANTITY', '60 feet'}, {'QUANTITY', 'three-inch'}]","['the Jefferson Soil', 'the Ohio Hellbender Partnership', 'North America', 'Appalachia', 'Ozarks', 'Jefferson County', 'Monongahela', 'BC', 'Ohio River', 'Steubenville', 'Ohio', 'Jefferson County', 'Jefferson County', 'the Ohio Hellbender Partnership', 'Ohio', 'the Ohio Division of Wildlife', 'Steubenville to Findlay', 'Ohio', 'the Ohio Division of Wildlife', 'Cross Creek', 'Jefferson County', 'Steubenville', 'Pet Supplies Plus', 'the Jefferson Soil and Water', 'the Steubenville Public Library', 'Amazon', 'Red Lobster']"
0,"A new 316-acre land purchase is now protecting nesting sites and coastal habitat for the iconic Endangered Maleo, all as part of a planned 47,328-acre protected area.

Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, located within Wallacea – an archipelago straddling the boundaries of Asia and Australia – contains a mix of biodiversity from both continents as well as its own completely unique species, including the Endangered Maleo. As one of Asia’s most iconic birds, the Maleo builds mounds to incubate its eggs through volcanic and solar-heated sand in large colonial nesting grounds, a natural spectacle that leaves the eggs exceptionally vulnerable to harvesting. While not breeding in their localized colonies, Maleos reside in lowland rainforest foothills, making deforestation an additional threat facing the endemic species. With a nearly 90 percent decline in population size since 1950, it is estimated that fewer than 5,000 of these birds remain in the wild.

Rainforest Trust’s local partner, WCS-Indonesia, has been working diligently on developing new conservation efforts to protect the Maleo and its specialized habitats in northern Sulawesi since 2001. With Rainforest Trust assistance, the local partner has protected an additional 316 acres of nesting sites and coastal habitat. This new purchase will contribute to the overall project, which will form a 47,328-acre protected area of nesting sites, coastal habitat, forest conservation area and agroforestry buffer zone. It will also form a protected corridor by linking to the 709,477-acre Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park, which is the largest nature reserve in Sulawesi and supports over 65 percent of the mammal species and 38 percent of the bird species present on the island.

“The Mataindo-Torosik corridor is one of the only remaining intact stretches of coastal forest in Sulawesi. When I visited the site this summer it was immediately clear how important the area is for threatened forest-dwelling biodiversity,” said Rainforest Trust Director of Biodiversity Conservation Dr. Bert Harris. “I am thrilled that Rainforest Trust is involved in the protection of this key site.”

Some of the other threatened species to benefit from these new protections include the Spectral Tarsier, Lowland Anoa, Gorontalo Macaque and Blue-faced Rail. Additionally, Endangered Green Turtles and Vulnerable Leatherback Sea Turtles nest on the beaches alongside the Maleos.

Thanks to our many generous friends around the world and the SAVES Challenge, this project is a success.

0,"A failing dam threatens to contaminate drinking water for thousands of people. Pollution in the Reedy River causes a shortage of recreational access points for Greenville County residents. And a raging wildfire births ecological wonders at Table Rock State Park just months after destroying thousands of acres.

The year 2017 has seen no shortage of environmental disasters and breakthroughs. In our annual Year in Review report, we’re presenting developments that hold profound implications for the region — and world — going forward. These are the Greenville Journal’s top environmental news stories of the year.

Lake Conestee is one step closer to causing one of the worst environmental disasters in the Upstate since the 1996 Colonial Pipeline spill, which dumped nearly 1 million gallons of diesel fuel into the Reedy River.

The lake, which is on the Reedy River near Mauldin, holds about 2.8 million tons of sediment that’s been polluted with heavy metals like arsenic, pesticides, and cancer-causing chemical compounds. The toxins are thought to have been discharged from the textile mills, coal plants, and dyeing operations that were once located along the Reedy River. The toxins eventually mixed with the river’s sediment and flowed downstream to Lake Conestee, where they now sit behind a 125-year-old stone masonry dam that’s quickly failing.

“Failure would be catastrophic,” said Dave Hargett, founder of the Conestee Foundation. Within 48 hours of the dam’s failure, it would release the lake’s toxic sediment into the Reedy River, where it would eventually float downstream to Boyd Pond in Laurens and Lake Greenwood, which provides drinking water for more than 40,000 Greenwood County residents. Now, the Conestee Foundation, the nonprofit that purchased the lake property in 2000, is trying to prevent the dam’s failure and has received $185,000 from the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control to identify a long-term solution.

In November 2016, the S.C. Forestry Commission announced that a small campfire had quickly grown into a raging wildfire on the side of Pinnacle Mountain in Pickens County. The fire grew larger and larger for several weeks, burning acreage and causing smoke to inundate the Upstate. The fire, which was contained a month later, burned more than 10,000 acres and cost $4.8 million. But it also had ecological benefits, according to Joe Lemeris, a resource management biologist for the state Department of Parks, Recreation, and Tourism. “People forget that wildfire is natural. It’s nature’s way of clearing out the old undergrowth to make room for the new,” he said. “The fire is already providing countless ecological benefits for the mountain.”

For instance, the forest floor, once scorched and barren, is now covered in leaves that provide erosion control and nutrients. It also provides a prime research opportunity for Lemeris, who has partnered with researchers at Clemson University and other schools to establish photo-monitoring stations across Pinnacle Mountain and other areas within Table Rock State Park. The researchers plan to study footage from the cameras this spring to better understand how the fire benefited the mountain’s landscape.

Despite its unhealthy amounts of pollution over the years, the Reedy River has become one of downtown Greenville’s most treasured spots for recreation. Every year, thousands congregate around the river’s scenic shoal and waterfall at Falls Park. And thousands more enjoy sports and various recreational activities along the river at Cleveland Park and Lake Conestee Nature Park.

But many residents believe the river needs more access points outside the city. The Reedy begins in Travelers Rest and meanders through the city of Greenville to Lake Greenwood. The upper portion of the river’s 75-mile path includes the urban areas of the cities of Greenville, Mauldin, Simpsonville, and Fountain Inn. Unfortunately, the river has to be clean enough for local governments to promote recreation and create public access points. Since the 1900s, the river has experienced severe pollution from nearby textile mills, sewage discharges, and runoff from increased urbanization. Now much of the river is listed by the state as “impaired,” a designation that signals possible health risks and causes local governments to prohibit swimming, kayaking, and other recreational activities. Luckily, partners ranging from regional conservation groups to local governments are collaborating to combat further contamination of the river.

About three-fourths of the world’s food crops depend on pollination, according to a report released by the United Nations Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. But the number of managed honeybee colonies in the United States has declined from 5 million to 2.5 million since the 1940s because of various threats – invasive species, diseases, pesticides, and habitat destruction.

Luckily, Greenville residents are beginning to raise honeybees in their backyards to help boost the declining population. “When you think about all the colonies that are dying off, it’s hard to say whether or not I’m actually impacting the global population,” said Matt Putnam, who started keeping bees at his residence off Highland Drive in 2015. “I think education is a bigger component for me. I’m sort of an ambassador for the species.”

There are several benefits that beekeeping can provide to people and the environment. Beekeepers can collect up to $200 worth of honey from each hive they maintain. And keeping bees is good for the environment because it aids in the pollination of nearby fruits, vegetables, and plants. “Bees are sort of the new backyard chickens,” said Jennifer Tsuruda, a beekeeping specialist at Clemson University.

Over the past century, American zoos have played a crucial role in saving hundreds of species from extinction. While most of the work has stemmed from breeding, more and more zoos are funding conservation in the field or even starting their own conservation programs. The Greenville Zoo, for instance, has spent more than $300,000 on conservation over the past seven years.

In 2010, the zoo’s conservation committee launched the Quarters for Conservation program to meet accreditation standards by creating a funding source for local and global conservation efforts. For each admission purchase, visitors receive a 25-cent token that can be inserted into a kiosk at the zoo’s entrance to vote for one of five conservation programs, which include efforts to help the Fijian crested iguana, Sumatran orangutan, Chilean flamingo, Amur leopard, and Angolan Colobus monkey. The zoo has also since launched an annual grant program and lecture series to promote conservation. Together, these efforts will help to ensure the health and longevity of countless species across the globe.",Year in Review: Top 5 Environmental News Stories of 2017,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vZ3JlZW52aWxsZWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL25ld3MveWVhci1yZXZpZXctdG9wLTUtZW52aXJvbm1lbnRhbC1uZXdzLXN0b3JpZXMtMjAxNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://greenvillejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/0728.GJ_.ReedyRiverCityPhotos1.WillIamCrooks.jpg,2017-12-28,"{'sent': 'A failing dam threatens to contaminate drinking water for thousands of people.', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['thousands']}}","A failing dam threatens to contaminate drinking water for thousands of people.

UC Davis veterinarian Dr. Jenessa Gjeltema opened her 7:30 a.m. staff meeting with a rundown of the day’s patients:

An armadillo, a tarantula, a Western pond turtle, a thick-billed parrot, a flamingo, a baby bongo and a Wolf’s guenon monkey.

Gjeltema doesn’t treat the usual dogs and cats. Her veterinary practice is one of the most exotic in the world. A specialist in zoological medicine, she cares for the Sacramento Zoo’s animals. There are about 575 of them, representing nearly 130 species — from tiny whiptail scorpions to 1,500-pound giraffes.

A key part of Gjeltema’s care is prevention — so she examines all of the animals regularly.

It’s no easy job diagnosing their diseases or figuring out how to treat them, she said. It often means heading into uncharted territory.

Sometimes, zoo vets face problems that no one has yet studied. Or they have to improvise tools to fix them. How do you find a medical instrument, for instance, small enough to do surgery on a hummingbird?

“You have to really be creative and think outside the box,” Gjeltema said. “You’ve got to come up with your own tools and your own path.”

The 35-year-old specialist proved her knowledge by passing the American College of Zoological Medicine’s grueling two-day exam for board certification — a feat that fewer than 200 veterinarians worldwide have accomplished. Gjeltema also teaches at UC Davis’ world-renowned veterinary medicine school and trains students in clinical practice.

The ties between UC Davis and the Sacramento Zoo are deep and historic. The late UC Davis veterinarian Dr. Murray Fowler was known as the father of zoological medicine because he created the specialty in 1967. He wrote its first textbook and chose the Sacramento Zoo as the site of the world’s first zoological medicine residency program.

The partnership with UC Davis gives the zoo “the highest-quality veterinary care and access to the latest information and tools in zoological medicine,” said zoo spokeswoman Tonja Candelaria.

On a recent visit, Gjeltema was assisted by the zoo’s registered vet technicians, Alison Mott and Julie Clements, and UC Davis vet school students Weina Dai and Audrey Buatois.

First up was Ringo, a 17-year-old armadillo and popular zoo “education ambassador,” tame enough to crawl into children’s laps for ear rubs. Gjeltema previously had detected a mass in his gallbladder and begun medications to slow its growth.

As Ringo lay on his back — sedated, hooked up to monitors, with an oxygen mask over his face — Gjeltema talked the students through locating his internal organs with an ultrasound device.

The mass was probably a gallstone, she told them. The question was whether to just keep an eye out for changes or opt for surgery. Together, they decided to monitor the mass, since it wasn’t expanding.

Next came Curly Sue, an 8-year-old tarantula with a lesion on her underside. The tarantula, about the size of Dai’s palm, required especially careful handling and protective gear because of her ability to shoot out barbed hairs.

Dai sedated her by placing her into a small plastic container with a cotton ball soaked in an anesthetic. Then Dai poked her back end with a tiny needle to draw her blood, pushed down her legs to check her muscle tone and put an ultrasound device as small as a fingernail to her heart.

“Do you hear it? It’s a little wave — whoosh whoosh,” Gjeltema said.

When Dai nodded, the vet grinned. “Nice work! Your first tarantula heartbeat!”

Suzie, a baby thick-billed parrot, was the day’s most serious case. The brightly colored parrot species is endangered. It’s also the only surviving species native to North America.

When Suzie appeared to have contracted a fungal pneumonia, Gjeltema and her team had to decide quickly whether to separate the nestling from her family, which could complicate her return. They chose to take the risk and move her to an oxygen incubator. On this visit, Gjeltema fed Suzie formula through a tube and administered antibiotics, antifungal medicine and inhalants to open her airways.

Suzie improved enough to move to a regular cage, and Gjeltema is hopeful for a smooth family reunion.

“There are complex social structures in zoological medicine,” she said. “You have to weigh the overall needs of the animal in the treatment plan.”

Before leaving for the day, Gjeltema and her students also treated Sutter, a Western pond turtle with a lesion on its shell, and a flamingo named Tiki with an abnormally bowed leg. They checked in on Taylor Swift, a striped baby Eastern bongo antelope, and Rory, an infant Wolf’s guenon monkey with a black face and bright, copper-colored tufted ears.

When she was growing up in North Carolina, Gjeltema loved playing with lizards. As a child, she dreamed of being a vet. In high school, she went to Sumatra to help care for orangutans, and in college she volunteered with a local Humane Society’s dog rescue program. But at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, she decided to triple major in business administration, international business and philosophy.

A school career counselor prodded her to change her path by telling her she came alive when she talked about animals, not business. The passion only grew with time.

“You’re always thinking: How do I help that animal?” Gjeltema said. “The answers are never straightforward, but that makes it fascinating and fun.”

(Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times)

UC Davis veterinarian Dr. Jenessa Gjeltema opened her 7:30 a.m. staff meeting with a rundown of the day’s patients:

An armadillo, a tarantula, a Western pond turtle, a thick-billed parrot, a flamingo, a baby bongo and a Wolf’s guenon monkey.

Gjeltema doesn’t treat the usual dogs and cats. Her veterinary practice is one of the most exotic in the world. A specialist in zoological medicine, she cares for the Sacramento Zoo’s animals. There are about 575 of them, representing nearly 130 species — from tiny whiptail scorpions to 1,500-pound giraffes.

A key part of Gjeltema’s care is prevention — so she examines all of the animals regularly.

It’s no easy job diagnosing their diseases or figuring out how to treat them, she said. It often means heading into uncharted territory.

Sometimes, zoo vets face problems that no one has yet studied. Or they have to improvise tools to fix them. How do you find a medical instrument, for instance, small enough to do surgery on a hummingbird?

“You have to really be creative and think outside the box,” Gjeltema said. “You’ve got to come up with your own tools and your own path.”

The 35-year-old specialist proved her knowledge by passing the American College of Zoological Medicine’s grueling two-day exam for board certification — a feat that fewer than 200 veterinarians worldwide have accomplished. Gjeltema also teaches at UC Davis’ world-renowned veterinary medicine school and trains students in clinical practice.

The ties between UC Davis and the Sacramento Zoo are deep and historic. The late UC Davis veterinarian Dr. Murray Fowler was known as the father of zoological medicine because he created the specialty in 1967. He wrote its first textbook and chose the Sacramento Zoo as the site of the world’s first zoological medicine residency program.

The partnership with UC Davis gives the zoo “the highest-quality veterinary care and access to the latest information and tools in zoological medicine,” said zoo spokeswoman Tonja Candelaria.

On a recent visit, Gjeltema was assisted by the zoo’s registered vet technicians, Alison Mott and Julie Clements, and UC Davis vet school students Weina Dai and Audrey Buatois.

First up was Ringo, a 17-year-old armadillo and popular zoo “education ambassador,” tame enough to crawl into children’s laps for ear rubs. Gjeltema previously had detected a mass in his gallbladder and begun medications to slow its growth.

As Ringo lay on his back — sedated, hooked up to monitors, with an oxygen mask over his face — Gjeltema talked the students through locating his internal organs with an ultrasound device.

The mass was probably a gallstone, she told them. The question was whether to just keep an eye out for changes or opt for surgery. Together, they decided to monitor the mass, since it wasn’t expanding.

Next came Curly Sue, an 8-year-old tarantula with a lesion on her underside. The tarantula, about the size of Dai’s palm, required especially careful handling and protective gear because of her ability to shoot out barbed hairs.

0,"A small village in the Indonesia island of Sulawesi is keeping alive a tradition of healing based on remedies derived from locally grown herbs and other plants.

The importance of traditional medicine to the community means the villagers have long been diligent about protecting the forest in which the plants grow.

This has translated into hefty fines for unregulated logging or poaching of local wildlife, including the maleo, a bird found only in Sulawesi.

PAKULI INDUK, Indonesia — In a remote village on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi lies a small garden of near-mythic repute — a place whose stewards grow not mere plants, but hopes and cures that have served the community for generations.

Packed into a single hectare (2.5 acres) in Pakuli Induk village, in Central Sulawesi province, are 400 different types of herbal plants, first collected and grown by Sahlan, a shaman, or sando, from the Kaili tribe.

Like a real-life Getafix, Sahlan relied on plants that grow in the area to treat the needs of the villagers, venturing deep into the forest to pick the ingredients for herbal remedies for everything from sore eyes to kidney problems to ovarian cysts. The son of shamans, he was bequeathed the small lot for a garden in 1999 by the local chief, who was taken by Sahlan’s passion for his craft.

Nearly 20 years on, Sahlan now practices traditional medicine in Palu, the provincial capital, and has left the running of the garden to the children and young adults of the Assyfa orphanage.

“It was Sahlan who taught us at first,” says Risfa, 21, one of the 70 youths at the orphanage now tasked with caring for the garden.

Risfa then rattles off a list of plants grown there and their purported qualities: kada buku, whose leaves are used to treat external wounds; kanuna, believed to be effective in the treatment of ovarian cysts; keji beling, prescribed for kidney and appendix problems; kulei, whose sap is used as eye drops; and mavana, said to cure coughing in children.

There’s also the ginseng-like root of the tudong layu plant, which, also like ginseng, is said to help treat erectile dysfunction. “It’s best to mix it with eggs and honey,” Finra, another of the caretakers, says while laughing.

Traditional healing

As in most other parts of rural Indonesia, traditional medicine is the only kind of healthcare most people here have access to. In 2015, there were all of 12 medical professionals registered in Sigi district, where Pakuli Induk district is located, according to the national statistics agency; of those, only two were doctors, serving a population of nearly 230,000.

“Sando are believed to be more effective” than medical doctors, says Amran Tambaru, a local environmental activist. He adds that for communities like Pakuli Induk, shamans are often the first choice of health provider.

It’s little wonder, then, that Sahlan’s garden plays a central role in the lives of the villagers, who can buy a packet of mixed herbs tailored to treat specific ailments for about $2. Zainal, a former charge of the orphanage, says many of the plants grown in the garden are also found around the village. But the villagers are welcome to come in and pick, for free, any herbs they can’t find elsewhere, as long as they ask for permission first.

Safeguarding the forest

The reverence with which the community has long regarded traditional medicine, and by extension the plants on which it is based, has cultivated a respect for the environment that holds to this day. Any activity with the potential to disrupt the integrity of the natural ecosystem is strictly regulated to minimize damage.

Logging, for instance, can only be carried out if the timber is to be used to build a house. Even then, it requires permission from the village council, who also determine the location within the forest where trees may be felled. Violations of any of these rules is punishable by fines in the form of money or livestock — a serious financial setback in a community of subsistence farmers.

Similar rules are in place to protect the wildlife. Pakuli Induk’s forests are rich in fauna, bordering Lore Lindu National Park. The 2,180-square-kilometer (840-square-mile) reserve is home to 77 species of birds found only in Sulawesi, including the rare and endangered maleo (Macrocephalon maleo), a striking-looking fowl with a black helmet casque atop its head.

A captive-breeding center has been set up for the maleo in the Pakuli Induk forest. The bird is considered sacred among the community, and the punishment for any attempt to poach it is suitably severe.

“If anyone dares try to catch one, they can be fined a water buffalo,” says Zainal, noting that the high value and scarcity of buffalo make them a commodity not worth losing.

For the villagers, the forest and its plants and animals have long been a source of sustenance and well-being. And thanks to the orphans of Pakuli Induk, the stewardship of the local environment appears to be in safe hands.

The heartbroken carers of the famous Jungle Zoo rhinoceros iguana have spoken of their sadness after finding their beloved ""mascot"" dead on Christmas Day.

Rhino the rhinoceros iguana was a firm favourite at the Cleethorpes Jungle Zoo, known for his friendly and unique nature as he would wander amongst the guests in the zoo, and saying hello to some of his friends who lived there, striking up a special bond with the resident pig PD.

Owners of the Jungle Zoo, Sharon and Craig Gledhill say that the zoo ""just doesn't feel the same anymore"" without rhino walking around on his ever present quest for a loose banana, and felt that a lot of regular visitors will be very saddened to hear of his loss.

He passed away due to heart failure on Christmas Day, only a few months after celebrating his 21st birthday.

Described as being ""more like a dog than a lizard"" Rhino had a very unique personality, not often associated with reptiles, and was very affectionate and caring, and enjoyed being around people and other animals more than anything.

Sharon said: ""Rhino arrived at the Jungle Zoo 14 years ago, and ever since he had pretty much taken ownership of the place.

""He was originally raised as a family pet, and brought up around children, so he was always very comfortable around them, and I would go as far as to say he was his happiest when he was surrounding by people all giving him a bit of attention.

(Image: Rick Byrne)

""He was really more like a dog than a lizard and he was very affectionate, often taking a sudden shine to certain people who walked through the door, following them everywhere, especially if they had a banana, his favourite food.

""Over the years he must have met thousands and thousands of people, each leaving with their own special memory of this wonderful reptile, and I know that there are many who would come to the zoo just to see him.""

(Image: Rick Byrne)

Craig said: ""He was so unique, I have never come across an animal quite like him at all.

""He would develop these strange friendships with our guests and the other animals here, and it was a common sight to see him laying beside our pig PD, as for some crazy reason they just adored each other.""

As rhinoceros iguanas are a very vulnerable species, under great threat in the wild, the couple are hoping to continue the legacy of Rhino by taking part in a breeding scheme.

Craig continued: ""Rhino really helped teach people that reptiles aren't quite what you expect.

""He broke barriers in showing that they are not some cold and indifferent creature, and there is so much more to them, and I am just sad that we won't see him prowling around anymore.""

The Jungle Zoo is currently closed as it undergoes some improvement works, but will be open again for a week on February 12 for the half term.

He passed away due to heart failure on Christmas Day, only a few months after celebrating his 21st birthday.

Described as being ""more like a dog than a lizard"" Rhino had a very unique personality, not often associated with reptiles, and was very affectionate and caring, and enjoyed being around people and other animals more than anything.

Sharon said: ""Rhino arrived at the Jungle Zoo 14 years ago, and ever since he had pretty much taken ownership of the place.

""He was originally raised as a family pet, and brought up around children, so he was always very comfortable around them, and I would go as far as to say he was his happiest when he was surrounding by people all giving him a bit of attention.

""He was really more like a dog than a lizard and he was very affectionate, often taking a sudden shine to certain people who walked through the door, following them everywhere, especially if they had a banana, his favourite food.

""Over the years he must have met thousands and thousands of people, each leaving with their own special memory of this wonderful reptile, and I know that there are many who would come to the zoo just to see him.""

Craig said: ""He was so unique, I have never come across an animal quite like him at all.

""He would develop these strange friendships with our guests and the other animals here, and it was a common sight to see him laying beside our pig PD, as for some crazy reason they just adored each other.""

As rhinoceros iguanas are a very vulnerable species, under great threat in the wild, the couple are hoping to continue the legacy of Rhino by taking part in a breeding scheme.

Craig continued: ""Rhino really helped teach people that reptiles aren't quite what you expect.

""He broke barriers in showing that they are not some cold and indifferent creature, and there is so much more to them, and I am just sad that we won't see him prowling around anymore.""

The Jungle Zoo is currently closed as it undergoes some improvement works, but will be open again for a week on February 12 for the half term.

Biodiversity conservationists have condemned the recent killing of a manatee in Delta State, South-south of Nigeria.

Manatee, otherwise known as the sea cow, is a marine mammal. They are considered to be among the world’s endangered species

Some villagers reportedly caught the manatee in Sapele about a week ago, butchered the animal, and shared its pieces among themselves.

A Twitter user, by name Amama Benedict (@BennyCapricorn), posted on the social media site photos of the manatee when it was caught and after it was cut in pieces.

He told PREMIUM TIMES that he posted the photos to attract interests from people and probably ignite a debate on why it was wrong to kill the animal.

“They should have sent it to an institute for research purposes or a zoo,” Mr. Benedict wrote on Twitter.

Edem Eniang, a biodiversity conservationist in Nigeria, described the killing of the manatee as a big loss and a shame to Nigeria.

Mr. Eniang, who is a senior lecturer and a specialist in Wildlife Resources Management ‏at the University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom state, said he was aware of the incident and that he has notified other interested experts around the world.

“It is not only in Sapele; in Lagos State alone, three manatees have been killed since December, last year, to this January,” he told PREMIUM TIMES on Monday.

“There is also a story of a stranded whale in Ondo State. A young whale got stranded by a seashore. While it was still alive, Nigerians only found it necessary to stand on top of it to take selfies and posted it online.

“They started butchering the whale when it was still breathing.

“And the most painful components, aside from the killing of the manatee and the whale, if you read people’s commentary online, you will find out, very sadly, that 70 per cent or more of the Nigerian population are stark illiterate as far as conservation is concerned,” Mr. Eniang said.

Mr. Eniang appealed to the Nigerian media to help enlighten the people on the importance of conservation.

Clement Ebin, a former General Manager of the Cross River National Park and the President of the Biodiversity Preservation Centre, BPC, Nigeria, said the Sapele incident was a “sad development” for Nigeria.

Mr. Ebin, who is an advocate of the protection of Nigeria’s rainforest, said that the killing of the manatee speaks volumes of the people’s attitude towards the rainforest.

Villagers in Sapele, Delta State, killed an African manatee, cut it into pieces and shared it meat among the locals

“Nigeria has been very callous about the way they handle the rainforest. The rainforest is a species endemic ecosystem; most of the species that are getting extinct in the world are found in the rainforest. But we are here cutting down timber recklessly, burning the forest, poisoning streams with chemicals and destroying just everything that is living,” he said.

Manatees, he said, are harmless animals.

“Anything you do unsustainably does not last. If you have money today, no matter the billions you have, and stack them somewhere and all you do is continue to spend millions every day, a time comes when that source would run dry.

“We want the manatee population to build back so that even the manatee eater will have what to eat today and tomorrow,” Mr. Ebin said.

African manatee is said to exist in 21 countries, and is believed to be the most heavily hunted, although no one knows how many are killed annually.

0,"A lizard with no lungs, a deer with vampire fangs and a little black bird carrying around human baby teeth in its beak all walk into a country.

This is no joke set-up — this is a real snapshot of the eccentric biodiversity of South Korea (well, except maybe for the baby teeth thing… more on that in a minute).

As the 2018 Winter Games unfold in Pyeongchang, can the viewing public count on any surprise animal cameos akin to the 30 or 40 dog-size rodents called capybaras that invaded the golf links during the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro? Live Science investigated the funkiest fauna of the Korean Peninsula and compiled this list of the likeliest suspects.

Musk deer

Don't fear the fangs: the South Korean musk deer is a gentle herbivore with a smell worse than its bite. (Image credit: Shutterstock)

Any Olympians who wander too far into the forested hills outside Pyeongchang might come home with horror stories about the smelly, vampire-fanged denizens of the woods. Male Siberian musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) may look fierce with their saber teeth, but they're actually harmless herbivores. ""The males have these long sabers to fight each other during the mating season,"" Jack Tseng, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History, previously told Live Science.

In fact, musk deer, which are native to mountainous habitats around Asia and Russia, have far more to fear from humans than the other way around: Male deer are routinely poached for their eponymous scent glands, which can be worth nearly $20,455 per pound ($45,000 per kilogram) on the black market, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). In 2016, South Korean researchers started work on cloning the musk deer to save the species from extinction.

Korean magpie

(Image credit: Shuuerstock)

The Korean magpie (Pica pica sericea) is a stocky, black, crow-like bird with a white belly and blue-striped wings. Korean magpies are popular enough in South Korea to land a spot on the Google Doodle inaugurating this year's Winter Games — but these little black birds have had a foothold in culture for a lot longer than Google has been around. Magpies are a common symbol of luck in Korean folklore, and they sometimes even fill in for the tooth fairy. Some Korean children reportedly learn to throw their baby teeth onto the roofs of their homes so that a magpie will fly off with the discarded chompers and bring back healthy new ones in their place.

Despite their folkloric reputation, magpies probably don't take kindly to repeated projectile tooth attacks. According to a 2011 study, Korean magpies can learn to recognize individual human faces and remember which individuals have posed a threat to the safety of their nests.

White-naped crane

(Image credit: Shutterstock)

White-naped cranes (Antigone vipio) are elegant, endangered and apt to spend winter in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea. In other words, they're the perfect symbol of peace on the Korean Peninsula.

The species takes its name from the white stripe running down the back of its neck, but it might be more striking for the vivid red patches around its eyes. According to the International Crane Foundation, white-naped cranes breed primarily in northeastern China and Mongolia, but several hundred birds fly south to the Korean DMZ every winter. (Thousands of others continue on to one of several artificial feeding stations in Japan.) This Korean stopover may be critical to the species' survival, the IUCN says. Due to the ongoing loss of their wetland breeding grounds to human activities, the cranes are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN.

Wild boar

You might not expect the king of the mountain predators to oink, but according to reports from the Seoul Metropolitan Fire and Disaster Headquarters, wild boars (Sus scrofa) are ""now at the top of the food chain in Korea.""

The scruffy swine spend most of their time in mountain ecosystems, but in recent years, they have become increasingly comfortable venturing down into cities. Wild-boar sightings in Seoul, for example, have increased 11-fold, from 56 city sightings in 2012 to 623 in 2016, the Seoul Metropolitan Fire and Disaster Headquarters said, mostly occurring between September and December, when there is less food available in the hills. As natural predators like tigers have become extinct from Korea, boars thrive — and that's making human-boar interactions more common than ever.

Lungless salamander

Meanwhile, lurking under a nearby rock, a lungless salamander breathes through its skin. The Korean crevice salamander (Karsenia koreana) was only discovered in 2003, and scientists still don't know much about it. The critter mostly keeps to itself underneath rocks in limestone forests and bears a lot of similarities to the North American lungless salamander family, also called Plethodontidae, which comprises most of the world's salamander species. So far, K. koreana is the only lungless salamander to have been detected in Asia, but it was probably once just one among many others that are now extinct, researchers believe.

""The habitats in Asia are appropriate for these animals — so it is strange that they became extinct there and not here,"" David Wake, a biologist and salamander expert at the University of California, Berkeley, previously told Live Science.

In other words: Amphibian enthusiasts hoping to see more lungless salamanders on the Korean Peninsula probably shouldn't hold their breath.

These 10 limited-edition polo shirts feature nearly extinct animals. According to the IUCN, there are only 30 living Vaquitas in the Gulf of California. The Vaquita, the world’s smallest porpoise, falls prey to fishing nets and illegal off-shore fishing in the Sea of Cortez. Since only 30 of these beautiful creatures remain, Lacoste created only 30 versions of this polo to reflect their small numbers — this polo is already sold out, and all of the profits going to the IUCN’s SOS program.

Other endangered animals and their populations:

The Burmese Roofed Turtle – 40

The Northern Sportive Lemur – 50

The Javan Rhino – 67

The Cao-vit Gibbon – 150

The Kakapo – 157

The California Condor – 231

The Saola – 250

The Sumatran Tiger – 350

The Anegada Ground Iguana – 450

If you want to support these animals and flaunt a little style swerve by usurping the usual crocodile logo, you better act fast because, as of this writing, there are only three of these limited edition polos remaining.

For each species, the number of polo shirts produced corresponds to the number of individuals known to remain in the wild. For instance, the most limited run features The Gulf of California porpoise, of which there are only 30 left in the wild, while the brand made 450 shirts featuring the Cyclone of Anegada Island – an iguana from the British Virgin Island.

The French brand made 1,775 polo shirts in total.

Proceeds from the sale of the shirts will be donated to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a 70-year-old international organisation working in the field of nature conservation and sustainable use of natural resources.

The Save Our Species collaboration, which was initiated by French advertising agency BETC, will help the charity to coordinate frontline projects worldwide in order to help ensure the long-term survival of threatened species, their habitats and the people who depend on them.

""Lacoste and BETC worked closely with IUCN's experts to define and select ten threatened species, whose animals have been designed by the Lacoste studio to create the logos, adopting exactly the same embroidery approach as the historic Crocodile,"" it continued.

The animals include the Burmese roofed turtle, the vaquita, the northern sportive lemur, the Javan rhino, the Cao-vit gibbon, the kakapo, the California condor, the saola, the Sumatran tiger, and the Anegada ground iguana.

The number of shirts with each animal corresponded to the population left in the wild. For example, 30 shirts were produced of the vaquita, 40 of the northern sportive lemur, 150 of the Cao-vit gibbon, 157 of the kakapo, 231 of the California condor, 350 of the Sumatran tiger, etc. The most number of shirts were produced of the Anegada rock iguana — 450. A total of 1,775 polo shirts were produced, and all of them were sold out.

This is the first time the company has sold shirts featuring other animals. The proceeds from the sales went to the IUCN, which is an international organization working to conserve nature and promote sustainable use of natural resources.

The animals were selected by IUCN, Lacoste and French advertising agency BETC. Currently, the IUCN has listed 8,455 animals as endangered.

IUCN in a statement said, “The Lacoste team has created 10 limited edition polo shirts, where its iconic crocodile leaves its historic spot to ten threatened species. Together these rare reptiles, birds and mammals champion the plight of all known threatened species.”

“For IUCN in its 70th anniversary year, not only is this an opportunity to engage with business to help achieve its mission, but it also fits with the SOS open partnership approach which invites support from all sectors of civil society to bring their respective skills and competencies to bear in scaling up the fight on extinction,” the statement continued.

Lacoste’s move was lauded by wildlife expert Jeff Corwin, who spoke to CNN, saying, “It's a great start and I'm hoping it's just the beginning and inspires other companies to follow suit. Maybe Jaguar will do something for jaguars. Ram trucks maybe will start protecting big horn sheep. Generating awareness is equally important to fundraising because in order to solve the problem you need to understand the challenges.”

Generating awareness is equally important to fundraising because in order to solve the problem you need to understand the challenges.”

The company’s original logo — the crocodile — was adapted in 1936 because it was the name given to French tennis champion Rene Lacoste, who is also one of the founders of the clothing brand, due to his tenacity on the court.","[{'French', 'NORP'}, {'Lacoste', 'PERSON'}, {'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', '10'}, {'DATE', 'March 1'}, {'Save Our Species', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', 'three-year'}, {'IUCN', 'ORG'}, {'Lacoste', 'PERSON'}, {'Burmese', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Javan'}, {'California', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Sumatran'}, {'Anegada', 'GPE'}, {'CARDINAL', '30'}, {'CARDINAL', '40'}, {'CARDINAL', '150'}, {'CARDINAL', '157'}, {'CARDINAL', '231'}, {'California', 'GPE'}, {'350', 'CARDINAL'}, {'PERSON', 'Sumatran'}, {'Anegada', 'GPE'}, {'CARDINAL', '450'}, {'1,775', 'CARDINAL'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'IUCN', 'ORG'}, {'IUCN', 'ORG'}, {'Lacoste and', 'ORG'}, {'French', 'NORP'}, {'EVENT', 'BETC'}, {'IUCN', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', '8,455'}, {'IUCN', 'ORG'}, {'The Lacoste team', 'WORK_OF_ART'}, {'CARDINAL', '10'}, {'CARDINAL', 'ten'}, {'IUCN', 'ORG'}, {'70th', 'ORDINAL'}, {'ORG', 'SOS'}, {'PERSON', 'Jeff Corwin'}, {'CNN', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Jaguar'}, {'1936', 'DATE'}, {'French', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Rene Lacoste'}]","['French', 'International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'Save Our Species', 'IUCN', 'Burmese', 'California', 'Anegada', 'California', 'Anegada', 'IUCN', 'IUCN', 'Lacoste and', 'French', 'BETC', 'IUCN', 'IUCN', 'IUCN', 'SOS', 'CNN', 'French']"

The iguana, which was once found in neighbouring Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands, is now native to Anegada and Guana Island in the British Virgin Islands.

There are now less than 500 documented Anegada ground iguanas on the planet.

It has joined the list of the critically endangered lizard species around the world.

The iguana’s habitat has been shrinking largely due to the introduction of cattle breeding and agriculture.

Lacoste’s partnership with IUCN

The move to use an image of the Anegada ground iguana in place of the Lacoste’s crocodile logo is the French clothing brand’s way of partnering with the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Save Our Species programme.

Effectively, the programme is geared at raising awareness about the most threatened animal species on the planet and create “frontline projects worldwide to help ensure the long-term survival of threatened species”.

“By buying a polo, you participate in helping IUCN and Lacoste in the fight for wildlife conservation worldwide,” Lacoste announced on its website.

A total of 1,775 polos were made exclusively for the programme, which represented the number of remaining species facing extinction because of poaching, deforestation, and climate change.

Less than three years after the state declared its intention to establish an area of 1690.5 hectares (ha) in Mumbai suburban district as Thane Creek Flamingo Sanctuary, it issued a notification declaring the area as a flamingo sanctuary.

On May 10, the state issued a gazette identifying limits of the sanctuary across western-end of Thane creek with areas such as Mulund (143.16 ha), Vikhroli (257.35 ha), Bhandup (94.92 ha), Kanjur (264.87 ha), and parts of Mandale village (72.28 ha). Additionally, the creek area (revenue land) was identified as 794.48 ha, allowing total area of the sanctuary to be 1,690.52 ha.

The notification, however, allowed right of way for construction, operation and maintenance of seven transmission lines — three from Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL) of 660 kilovolt (KV) and four from Tata Power (840 KV).

“Sub-Divisional Officer, Eastern Suburban, Mumbai has allowed right of way subject to terms and conditions specified by Chief Wildlife Warden, Maharashtra State,” the gazette notification read.

“Now, we have settled all the rights. Earlier it was a notification of intention,” said Virendra Tiwari, chief conservator of forest (Mantralaya), state forest department. “An enquiry was conducted by the deputy collector, eastern suburbs. All claims were settled and allowed the right of way for the transmission lines for two major power distributors, which is the only activity that has been allowed. They can carry out work and maintenance. Otherwise such activities are prohibited in any sanctuary area.”

Ornithologists said it will have to be seen what technology will be used to protect the migratory path of these birds by the forest department. “These transmission lines have been there for many years all along the creek, and act as roost sites for several birds of prey and larger aquatic. However, there is always a chance of casualties due to electrocution or flying into them,” said Sunjoy Monga, ornithologist and naturalist writer.

Mumbai Mangrove Conservation Unit (MMCU), under the state mangrove cell, will manage the entire sanctuary. “There is a process of demarcating any sanctuary through settlement of rights, and since the process is now completed, the area is a sanctuary in its true sense. It is a significant milestone, which will boost conservation,” said N Vasudevan, additional principal chief conservator of forest, state mangrove cell.

In April, the mangrove cell began boat rides for citizens through the Thane creek to witness migratory and wetland birds that flock the site.

Species list of Thane creek

- 7 species of fish

- 3 crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, crayfish) and one edible bivalve (marine molluscs)

- 150 bird species (40,000 Flamingos and lakhs of wetland birds including waders, plovers Oriental Stork, Black-headed Ibis, Indian and Greater Spotted Eagles, White-bellied Sea-eagle, Eurasian Curlew, Black-tailed Godwit, Black-bellied Tern, Caspian Tern, European Roller, Indian Skimmer, Painted Stork and many others)

- 68 insect species

- 29 species of butterflies and moths

- 9 species of mangroves - Avicennia marina being the dominant one

- 37 species of phytoplankton - dominance of Skletonema, Thalassiosira and Rhizosolenia was recorded

Australian architect Mitchel Squires designed the seven-bedroom residence to make the most of the spectacular rolling-hills setting: “I was really taken by its surroundings, in fact many parts of South Lombok are fairly untouched and local villagers were watchful of the new developments.

The new logos will all feature animals that are facing a severe threat of extinction in an initiative named ‘Save the Species’. The project is a commitment between Lacoste and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in hopes of supporting endangered species around the world.

The animals replacing the traditional crocodile consist of the Vaquita porpoise, Burmese roofed turtle, Northern lemur, Javan rhino, Cao-vit gibbon, Kakapo parrot, California condor, the Saola, Sumatran tiger, and the Anegada ground iguana.

Zoo director Dr Kevin Lazarus said about five to six nests have been spotted high up in trees within the zoo.

“We have seen some fledglings flying out of the nests, while some other adult birds have began nesting, a sign they were getting ready to breed and lay eggs.

“With the birds nesting within the grounds of the zoo, they can be seen at the nearby Taiping Lake Gardens during the day. At night they come back to the zoo,” he said.

Lazarus said, just recently he spotted 12 milky storks and one fledgling at the Lake Gardens.

“We are hoping to get more of these endangered birds within the Taiping area, and hopefully they can later spread to the Kuala Gula bird sanctuary in Kerian.

“Currently these birds feel safe in the zoo area, but the population of the birds Kuala Gula is dwindling,” he added.

He said under the conservation programme started between 10 and 12 years ago, the zoo successfully bred 40 milky storks in captivity.

Zoo Negara and Singapore’s Jurong Bird Park provided the birds for the programme.

“Once the breeding was successful, we felt it was time to release the storks to increase the endangered species.

“So now the public is able to view the milky storks at the zoo’s aviary, as well as in the wetlands.

“It is really nice to see that the efforts to increase the population of the birds is showing positive results,” he added.

In 2014, Lazarus had said that burung botak upeh, the local name for the endangered milky stork is nearly extinct, and the Kuala Gula mangrove forest is the only place where the bird could be sighted in the wild in Malaysia.

About 25 years ago, there were more than 100 of the species, but the number of these birds has dwindled over the years.

0,"WASHINGTON (CN) – Highlighting threats that the brilliantly colored parrot faces from the pet trade and deforestation, wildlife advocates brought a lawsuit to ensure federal protection of the scarlet macaw.

Represented by Jeremy McKay, an attorney with the Denver legal outfit Environmental and Animal Defense, the nonprofit Friends of Animals brought its federal complaint on July 27 in Washington.

The group says it is still waiting for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to act on a petition it filed in January 2008 to have the scarlet macaw protected under the Endangered Species Act.

“At latest, defendants were required to complete this listing by January 2014,” the complaint states, referring to the agency and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. “Defendants have been in violation of this express statutory command for years.”

Friends of Animals notes that the government included the scarlet macaw in a listing rule proposed on July 6, 2012, only to leave the iconic bird off its September 2016 “listing workplan.”

“Defendants have omitted the scarlet macaw from any document that demonstrates FWS plans to act upon its congressionally mandatory duties concerning the macaw,” the complaint says.

When Friends of Animals brought its notice of intent to sue last month, the agency allegedly indicated that it would not finalize its listing decision on the jungle parrot until 2019.

“The ongoing nature of the threats caused by deforestation and poaching, which pose immediate threats to the scarlet macaw, demonstrates that it is reasonable to conclude the regulatory mechanisms addressing these threats are inadequate,” the complaint says.

Attorney McKay has not responded to a request for comment on the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment.

Friday’s lawsuit seeks protection for two populations of the scarlet macaw, which live in tropical humid forests in Central and South America. A southern subspecies called Ara macao macao has a green band separating the yellow and blue feathers on its wing coverts. The northern subspecies Ara macao cyanoptera is larger, has longer wing lengths and lacks the green band.

In addition to poachers, the predominantly red birds face habitat loss exacerbated by climate change, logging, and various industrial or agricultural factors.

A 2010 lawsuit that Friends of Animals brought against Fish and Wildlife Service for failing to submit a 12-month finding on the scarlet macaw, along with 11 other bird species, resulted in a settlement and a proposed rule on the species in 2012.",Fish and Wildlife Pushed to Protect Scarlet Macaw,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9maXNoLWFuZC13aWxkbGlmZS1wdXNoZWQtdG8tcHJvdGVjdC1zY2FybGV0LW1hY2F3L9IBUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9maXNoLWFuZC13aWxkbGlmZS1wdXNoZWQtdG8tcHJvdGVjdC1zY2FybGV0LW1hY2F3Lw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/scarlet-macaws-300x167.png,2018-07-30,"{'sent': 'WASHINGTON (CN) –', 'ents': {'GPE': ['WASHINGTON'], 'ORG': ['CN']}}","WASHINGTON (CN) – Highlighting threats that the brilliantly colored parrot faces from the pet trade and deforestation, wildlife advocates brought a lawsuit to ensure federal protection of the scarlet macaw.

0,"Early one summer morning, as rain is misting the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a middle-aged man is courting a crane. Chris Crowe, 42, bends forward in a slight bow and then ﬂaps his arms slowly, like wings. “Hey, girl, whatcha think,” he coos.

Walnut has heard that line before. The stately bird ignores Crowe, reshuffles her storm cloud grey wings, and snakes her head gracefully to the ground, looking for something tasty to eat.

“Come on, now,” Crowe says. The zookeeper grabs a fistful of grass and tosses it into the air. This is Crowe’s sexiest move – a sly reference to building a nest together. Walnut looks up, curiosity glinting in her marigold eyes, but then she returns to probing the soft, wet ground with her bark-coloured bill. She’s simply not feeling romantic, and who can blame her? I’m watching the two of them from behind a van. With binoculars. The bird must be totally creeped out.

“Try getting in the van,” Crowe calls to me. I follow his suggestion, and, almost immediately, Walnut starts responding to Crowe’s overtures. She returns his bows and then turns away from him and holds her wings loosely away from her body. Kneeling behind the bird, Crowe rests a hand gently on her back. Then he starts rubbing her thighs, rhythmically, almost pornographically. Thirty seconds elapse – it feels much longer – before Walnut steps away from Crowe, fixes a few out-of-place feathers, and then stretches out her wings, asking for another go-round.

In past years, Crowe would have taken this opportunity to inject Walnut with a syringe of crane semen. Alas, a matchmaker in Memphis – the keeper of the white-naped crane studbook, whose job is to ensure a genetically diverse captive population – has decreed that they don’t need any more babies from Walnut, at least not this year. But that doesn’t stop Crowe and Walnut from going through the motions all summer long, five days a week, sometimes several times a day. “It’s not exactly fun for me, but it keeps Walnut happy,” Crowe says.

More to the point, this strange cross-species seduction has helped ensure that white-naped cranes continue to exist, at least in captivity, says Warren Lynch, a fellow zookeeper at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). “It’s amazing, what Chris has accomplished with Walnut,” Lynch says. “This isn’t something just anyone can do.”

When Walnut arrived at the Front Royal, Virginia, endangered species breeding centre, back in 2004, she was the most genetically valuable white-naped crane in captivity. At 23, she had yet to produce a single chick, and she had a reputation for murdering her mates. Two male cranes that made amorous overtures towards Walnut had been found dead, with their bellies sliced open by her sharp claws. That, at least, was the rumour, Lynch says.

Crowe, SCBI’s newest keeper, was assigned to the case. “Walnut had this whole ‘black widow’ thing going,” Lynch recalls. “I told Chris, ‘Be careful with this one’.” He would be so careful, in fact, so thoughtful and patient and understanding, that whether Walnut would become pregnant would be just one part of what transpired between them. Because the larger story was how Chris Crowe won over Walnut’s wild heart.

Walnut hatched on 2 July 1981, in an old horse barn in Baraboo, Wisconsin. She was the seventh white-naped crane born at the International Crane Foundation (ICF) that summer, so her arrival went largely unheralded, says ICF cofounder George Archibald. Volunteers named her, somewhat randomly, after their favourite dessert at a nearby diner, a walnut cream pie.

The foundation was in full-tilt crane-making mode, trying to churn out as many of the rare animals as possible, recalls former ICF ornithologist Michael Putnam. When a pair of cranes produced eggs, staff would put the eggs in an incubator, which would prompt the pair to make more.

Walnut’s parents, Mercury and Amazon, were happy to oblige. The handsome birds were famous at the ICF for producing loads of eggs, and also for their unusual origins. While most of the centre’s cranes were born in captivity, Mercury and Amazon were wild-caught birds. Captured illegally in China and smuggled to Hong Kong, the two cranes were probably en route to a private menagerie, or perhaps a taxidermist, Archibald says. Instead, they were intercepted by local authorities and eventually shipped to the ICF.

Though it would have been better to return the birds to the wild, international tensions in 1978 made that impossible, Putnam recalls. Plus, no one knew exactly where in China they had been captured, or what the birds might have been exposed to during transit. “We didn’t want to release birds that might carry diseases and put them back into the wild flock,” Putnam says.

This kind of poaching is less common today, but the white-naped crane population is falling fast because of a more relentless foe: booming human populations, which are overtaking, polluting or draining the wetlands that the birds need to survive. “One pair of cranes, to breed, usually requires huge wetland areas,” Archibald says. “It may be several acres, it may be several hundred acres.”

She came right up and was doing all sorts of displays. I didn’t quite understand at that point, but they were territorial Chris Crowe

In addition to demanding vast areas of untrammelled wilderness, these difficult birds seem almost drawn to marginal places. For instance, one of the white-naped cranes’ most important wintering grounds is the 2.5 mile wide demilitarised zone that separates North and South Korea. There, in a strange, de facto nature preserve, white-naped cranes and their even more endangered cousins, red-crowned cranes, root for tubers among the land mines they are too light to trigger. If tensions between the Koreas subside, however, the cranes will be in trouble. Farmers are already clamouring for access to the nutrient-rich land, and developers are planning for a reunification city and deepwater port.

As conservationists work to persuade people to preserve land for cranes, zoos are pursuing a parallel strategy. They are breeding captive white-naped cranes, creating an “insurance population”, ready to be reintroduced should their wild counterparts disappear. But the problem with captive populations of animals is that they tend to get inbred, which is why – in 1981 – keepers were thrilled to have the genes of Mercury and Amazon to add to the mix.

The pair didn’t seem to mind being transplanted from China to Wisconsin. Maybe the glacier-sculpted landscape of Baraboo felt familiar to the birds, or maybe Mercury and Amazon just decided to make the best of a strange situation. In any case, the two wowed ICF staff with their exuberant courtship displays – running, bowing, leaping and trumpeting their love for each other all summer long. That year, they produced nine chicks, including Walnut.

These wobbly baby birds were raised in small herds, minded by so called chick mamas who fed them, cleaned their pens and took them out to a horse ring for daily exercise and to a baby pool for swimming lessons. The chick mamas were mostly volunteers, says Joan Fordham, a former ICF employee. Fordham’s 10-year-old daughter was a chick mama one summer, and she apparently didn’t get a lot of training. “If the cranes started fighting, she knew how to separate them, and that was pretty much it,” Fordham recalls.

Standards for raising cranes have changed since then. Now, highly trained zookeepers take care of the birds, and chicks are either left with their parents or raised by foster parent cranes, if at all possible. That’s because the job of crane parent is more nuanced than we humans once realised. Cranes have elaborate body language and sophisticated hunting techniques – skills that chicks learn, at least in part, from observing their parents. In addition, if a captive-born chick is slated to be released into the wild, a fear of humans is crucial to their survival.

But perhaps the biggest reason crane chicks shouldn’t be hand-reared is the possibility that they may “imprint” on humans. When it’s time to find a suitable mate, some human-imprinted cranes seek out a partner that looks like their presumed parent – a human, instead of another bird. This, it seems, is what happened with Walnut.

Even back in the 1980s, crane keepers knew about the hazards of imprinting, and they took measures to make sure baby cranes saw plenty of other birds – by housing them in groups, for instance, and with mirrors. Some of the chicks, however, were intent on pecking their siblings to death, and they had to be separated from the others. Walnut might have been one such bird, Archibald thinks; he doesn’t know for sure because, like all of Walnut’s keepers before Crowe, he doesn’t remember Walnut specifically. “Probably she was alone and somebody paid too much attention to her,” Archibald says.

Bridging a 320 million year evolutionary divide, Walnut likely made some human fall in love with her. This volunteer must have been very motherly indeed, posits Lynch. “I can only imagine that when someone hand-raised her, they perhaps even carried her around like a baby or something,” he says. “I’ve just never seen a bird that strongly imprinted.”

This relationship, however well meaning, doomed Walnut to a life of loneliness. Cranes, which mate for life, are happiest when housed in pairs. Walnut was transferred to the Denver Zoo and then the Cincinnati Zoo, but keepers were never able to find her a mate. Somewhere along the line, she acquired her murderous reputation, though no zoo would admit to letting rare cranes die on their watch. Still, SCBI staff say the rumours are probably true.

Whether or not Walnut was killing her fellow cranes, she certainly wasn’t contributing to her species’ survival – which is why, in October 2004, she was transferred to SCBI for one last chance at motherhood.

I can only imagine that when someone hand-raised her, they perhaps even carried her around like a baby or something. I’ve just never seen a bird that strongly imprinted Warren Lynch

The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute sprawls across 3,200 acres of rolling hills near Shenandoah National Park. There, far from the noisy crowds that pour through its sister institution, the National Zoo in Washington DC, members of 21 threatened or endangered species are busy having babies, making their kinds a little less rare.

On his first week of work, in December 2004, Crowe met his new charges: 17 cranes and 36 ducks. Even among all these animals, Walnut stood out. Instead of hiding from Crowe like most of the other birds, she fearlessly walked to the chain-link fence separating them, ruffled her feathers and growled. “She came right up and was doing all sorts of displays,” he recalls. “I didn’t quite understand at that point, but they were territorial.” It was around then that Crowe’s colleague Warren Lynch mentioned Walnut’s (allegedly) murderous past.

Crowe knew to give all the cranes a wide berth. Though they look practically ethereal – weightless clouds of feathers on reed-thin legs – cranes are known for rending clothes and skin with precisely aimed claws. For a crane keeper, even mundane chores like cleaning out food bowls are edged with danger.

As winter shaded into spring, Carol Hesch, assistant curator at the Memphis Zoo and keeper of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ white-naped crane studbook, consulted a genetic database and determined that Walnut should be bred with Ray, a comely male crane two yards over. Ray, however, was already paired with Abigail; if they tried to put Walnut and Ray together, feathers would fly, so to speak. So, the plan was to use artificial insemination, a stressful procedure that requires capturing the birds and holding them down for minutes at a time.

One day that March, Crowe and Lynch entered Walnut’s cage and herded her into a corner. The moment Walnut looked away, Lynch grabbed her body underneath her wings. Then, he stepped over the bird and held her between his legs, facing backward. Kneeling behind her, Crowe began massaging Walnut’s cloaca – an all-purpose orifice that birds use for defecation as well as reproduction – and applied gentle pressure to her back, mimicking the weight of a male crane. Walnut purred, her cloaca opened, and Crowe injected semen that the two zookeepers had collected, in much the same way, from Ray.

A few weeks later, Walnut laid two fertilised eggs, which Crowe stole and placed in Ray and Abigail’s nest. That was necessary because, in the wild, cranes take turns incubating their eggs, and Crowe didn’t want Walnut to shoulder that burden alone. “It’s just too much for her,” he says, “and I don’t want to sit on it myself.”

Plus, it was becoming clear to Crowe that Walnut did not see herself as a crane and might not recognise baby cranes as her own. In fact, one young male crane with a clear view of Walnut was always trying to get her attention, with head bobs and calls. Walnut wasn’t having any of it. “She just gave him the stink eye,” Crowe says.

That summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings – motions that Crowe now recognises as the first moves of a mating dance. “At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,” Crowe says. “But then I’d see the other pairs doing the same things, and it kind of dawned on me.”

Crowe accepted Walnut’s invitation to dance. Though he felt a little silly, he bobbed his head when Walnut bobbed hers, and raised and lowered his arms like wings. The two circled each other, and sometimes Walnut would make a loud, trumpeting call – the beginning of the white-naped crane love duet. If no one was around, Crowe would try to do the male part of the song – making a Homer Simpson-like “woohoo” – but Walnut never found his efforts satisfactory.

As the weather cooled, so did Walnut’s ardour. But in the spring, Walnut began greeting her keeper with bows again. This gave Crowe an idea: If Walnut thought he was her mate, maybe Crowe could make that year’s artificial insemination less stressful for both of them. “If we could get her able to do it without catching her, there’s no stress, no risk of injury,” Crowe says. “It’s much better for us and for the crane.” Lynch agrees. “As far as we knew, it had never been done before, but it seemed like a good thing to try,” he recalls.

In fact, at least one man had “mated” with a crane before. Back in 1982, ICF’s George Archibald bonded with a whooping crane named Tex. Like Walnut, Tex had imprinted on humans, so Archibald decided to become her mate, artificially inseminate her and add one precious chick to the critically endangered whooping crane population. For three months, Archibald camped next to Tex’s yard and bonded with the bird by mimicking her dance moves. Keeping up with Tex required some real athleticism, Archibald says. “I would run around with her and leap into the air,” he recalls, “and it was very exhausting, actually. It was good exercise.”

Archibald knew all the cranes’ moves because he had studied crane behaviour for his PhD at Cornell University. Crowe, in contrast, learned how to woo Walnut by watching a pair of particularly amorous white-naped cranes named Brenda and Eddie, who also lived at SCBI. Brenda seemed to really like it when Eddie brought her material for their nest, so Crowe started bringing sticks and straw to Walnut. Sometimes she rejected Crowe’s offerings outright, tossing the sticks right out of the nest. “She’s real particular about the length and circumference of the sticks, and it changes from year to year,” Crowe says. When Crowe got it right, Walnut was clearly delighted.

Even though Crowe had proved his interior decorating skills, Walnut wouldn’t allow him to touch her – a key step in artificial insemination. So Crowe started training her to tolerate his touch. Reaching his arm out slowly, he’d graze Walnut’s tail feathers with his fingertips and then immediately reward her with a dead mouse, Walnut’s favourite treat. Eventually, Walnut allowed Crowe to pet her entire back, and she seemed to enjoy it, purring like a contented cat.

One day, after some back petting, Walnut turned away from Crowe, extended her wings, and raised her tail – an invitation to mate. Walnut was asking Crowe to flutter to her back and perform what’s poetically known as a “cloacal kiss”. Crowe recalls being both startled and amused. “It’s what I had been working towards and hoping for, but it was still surprising when it happened,” he says. Composing himself, Crowe put a hand on Walnut’s back and then rubbed her thighs, going through the motions of artificial insemination. This would prepare both of them for the real thing, come the following March.

Unfortunately, Walnut found Crowe to be a disappointing lover, at least at first. “I would start massaging her back, where the male crane would be perched when he’s copulating, but then I had to stop momentarily to start massaging other areas, and she would stop soliciting and walk away,” he says. “It took a little time for me to figure out to have one hand on one spot and another hand on the other spot, and for her to stay with it if I took my hands off her temporarily.”

I thought, if we’re causing all those extinctions and endangerments, then we are also the solution. We should be responsible for the solution, since we are causing the problem to begin with Chris Crowe

Once the two got their routine down, it was time to try again. In March 2007, Crowe and Lynch captured Ray and collected semen, and then Crowe injected it into Walnut by himself, with her willing participation.

Walnut and Crowe would go on to produce five chicks this way – a major boon for the captive white-naped crane population, Lynch says. That also means Walnut’s rare genes are no longer in danger of dying with her, which is why, in 2008, a crane named Amanda stole Walnut’s title as the most genetically valuable crane in captivity. Like Walnut, Amanda had few relatives and no offspring, so she was sent to SCBI to see if Crowe could work his magic again. He succeeded, so then he was sent another difficult female, a young crane named Wucheng.

“The training went much quicker with Amanda and Wucheng – I think because Walnut had kind of trained me,” Crowe says. Amanda was eventually paired successfully with a male crane, and Wucheng seems to be able to bond with both humans and cranes, so she, too, will probably be matched with another bird. But as far as Walnut is concerned, Crowe is her mate for life.

A quiet, watchful child, Chris Crowe always felt a special kinship with animals. And though he grew up among the strip malls and subdivisions of Rockville, Maryland, he found wildlife nearly everywhere he looked. “I’d feed the squirrels in the yard, or if there was a baby bird out of the nest, I’d bring it home, raise it, cut up worms for it, things like that,” he says. Crowe realises now that he probably should have left the birds where he found them. Fledglings look awkward and helpless, but it’s a normal stage of bird development. Their parents keep feeding them, sometimes for weeks after they leave the nest. When well meaning humans scoop them up, it’s usually bad news for the birds.

When Crowe was seven, while on a family vacation at Yellowstone National Park, his love for animals transformed into a lifelong calling. “My dad picked me up and walked me up to a bison, which is not the safest thing to do. And I started crying. I was scared and upset,” Crowe recalls. “My dad made some joke. He said, ‘If he charges you, stand your ground and I’ll run and get the car.’ I think that snapped me out of the crying in fear.” At that moment, Crowe saw the bison for what it was: “I started looking at its big, glossy eyes and twitching ears and wet nose, and I realised there’s a real being there, a real creature, a thinking, feeling animal.”

Later, on that same trip, he read about how 19th-century settlers nearly drove the bison to extinction. “I was horrified that people would do that,” he says. That realisation was quickly followed by another, one that set the course for Crowe’s career and life. “I thought, if we’re causing all those extinctions and endangerments, then we are also the solution,” he says. “We should be responsible for the solution, since we are causing the problem to begin with.”

After graduating from Virginia Tech in 1998, Crowe won internships at Blackwater and Patuxent national wildlife refuges, where he tallied wild birds and kept an eye on nesting wood ducks. Then, he got what he calls his big break: working at a California condor reintroduction programme. For a year, Crowe drove and hiked the vast desert surrounding the Grand Canyon, searching for condors that had been recently reintroduced. The inexperienced, young birds were just learning to soar and scavenge, and Crowe’s job was to bring them extra meat and flush them away from unsafe roosts.

He went on to work on a wolf reintroduction programme in North Carolina, then a shorebird research programme in North Dakota. Eventually, he landed back at Patuxent, where he was assigned to help raise whooping cranes. His job in 2003 was similar to that of the crane mamas that raised Walnut in 1981, but the rules for interacting with the chicks had become much stricter. To keep the cranes from imprinting on humans or becoming tame, Crowe wore a crane costume, and he never spoke words to the chicks. “If you wanted to talk to them, you had to make crane noises. If they were misbehaving or not paying attention, I’d just have to go, ‘Brrr, brrrr,’” says Crowe, demonstrating a sound like a trumpet player warming up. “Just like kids, they’d turn and look at you and stop fighting or goofing off or whatever they were doing.”

Crowe likes birds, but his dream job would be to work on another wolf reintroduction programme. Unfortunately, those jobs are hard to come by, because releasing pointy-toothed carnivores tends to be politically controversial. “A lot of people are afraid of wolves, though they really shouldn’t be,” he says.

Crane reintroduction programmes, on the other hand, are an easier sell. These graceful creatures awe us with their ability to cross continents and oceans, Archibald says. Saving them is “like saving a great work of art”. Plus, their magnetic beauty makes them excellent “umbrella species” – charismatic megafauna that inspire people to conserve entire ecosystems.

Crowe’s job with the whooping cranes at Patuxent was only seasonal, so when a permanent crane keeper position opened up at SCBI, he applied. And that’s when Crowe met Walnut.

Captive cranes can live past 60 years, which means Crowe’s commitment to Walnut could, in theory, last decades. “If she’s still here when I’m eligible for retirement, I won’t be able to leave,” he says. “I’d feel like a jerk.” Another male keeper – and Walnut clearly prefers men to women – might be able to woo her if Crowe were to disappear. But, as Crowe has seen with his other cranes, the loss of a mate is traumatic. Widowed cranes stop eating and fill the air with mournful calls, sometimes for weeks on end.

It’s unlikely that Walnut will be called on to produce more chicks, but Crowe continues to dance with her and even “mate” with her when she asks. It’s a strange job, but Crowe says he’s used to getting teased at this point. “I’ve heard every joke,” he says, and then shares his favourite: “What’s the difference between erotic and kinky? Erotic, you use a feather. Kinky, you use the whole bird.”

The best jokes, however, Crowe makes at his own expense. When I ask him if he has a partner, and if she or he is jealous of Walnut, Crowe responds with a disarming quip: “Walnut sets the bar pretty high. I’ll never find a woman that’s so happy to see me that she just starts dancing.”

Like an old couple, Crowe and Walnut have fallen into a comfortable routine. After “mating” with Crowe, Walnut will often lay unfertilised eggs. Crowe replaces them with fake ones; the real ones would rot and get eaten by crows, which would prompt Walnut to lay more. The bird then spends long hours sitting on the dummy eggs, so Crowe helps her out whenever he gets the chance. “I go over and stand near the nest and I say, ‘You take a break.’ And she’ll wander off. She’ll go down into the creek and take a bath. Then she walks back after 15 or 20 minutes, and she’s ready to sit back on the nest again.”

Though he does his best to not be a deadbeat dad, Crowe knows he falls short of crane standards. These are creatures that, once paired up, rarely lose sight of their partner; Crowe, in contrast, disappears every weekend. But despite Crowe’s shortcomings, Walnut loves him unconditionally. In fact, this 12-pound bird’s capacity for boundless affection sets a standard that we all could learn from, Crowe says. “The ideal partner doesn’t exist. You have to accept certain things that people can’t change,” he explains. “I mean, she puts up with me even though I can’t dance or sing.”

Crowe is proud of his groundbreaking work with cranes, but he admits that sometimes the whole project feels futile. White-naped cranes are continuing to decline in the wild, and many other species appear headed towards extinction. The heart of the matter, it seems, is that most people don’t share Crowe’s conviction that animals are thinking, feeling individuals. That they have just as legitimate a claim on this planet as we humans do.

How do we bridge the ever-widening gap that separates us from the environment, other animals and even one another? Maybe, Crowe and Walnut are demonstrating – and my apologies to The Beatles – that all you need is love. After all, what ultimately drives even the most scientific, tough-minded conservation efforts is an irrational, big-hearted embrace of a wilderness that’s coldly indifferent to us, an impossible connection we feel to animals that we can never truly understand. All this time, we heavy-headed primates assumed our brains held all the solutions, but maybe our hearts can be a better guide.

Chris Crowe, 42, bends forward in a slight bow and then ﬂaps his arms slowly, like wings. “Hey, girl, whatcha think,” he coos.

Walnut has heard that line before. The stately bird ignores Crowe, reshuffles her storm cloud grey wings, and snakes her head gracefully to the ground, looking for something tasty to eat.

“Come on, now,” Crowe says. The zookeeper grabs a fistful of grass and tosses it into the air. This is Crowe’s sexiest move – a sly reference to building a nest together. Walnut looks up, curiosity glinting in her marigold eyes, but then she returns to probing the soft, wet ground with her bark-coloured bill. She’s simply not feeling romantic, and who can blame her? I’m watching the two of them from behind a van. With binoculars. The bird must be totally creeped out.

“Try getting in the van,” Crowe calls to me. I follow his suggestion, and, almost immediately, Walnut starts responding to Crowe’s overtures. She returns his bows and then turns away from him and holds her wings loosely away from her body. Kneeling behind the bird, Crowe rests a hand gently on her back. Then he starts rubbing her thighs, rhythmically, almost pornographically. Thirty seconds elapse – it feels much longer – before Walnut steps away from Crowe, fixes a few out-of-place feathers, and then stretches out her wings, asking for another go-round.

In past years, Crowe would have taken this opportunity to inject Walnut with a syringe of crane semen. Alas, a matchmaker in Memphis – the keeper of the white-naped crane studbook, whose job is to ensure a genetically diverse captive population – has decreed that they don’t need any more babies from Walnut, at least not this year. But that doesn’t stop Crowe and Walnut from going through the motions all summer long, five days a week, sometimes several times a day. “It’s not exactly fun for me, but it keeps Walnut happy,” Crowe says.

More to the point, this strange cross-species seduction has helped ensure that white-naped cranes continue to exist, at least in captivity, says Warren Lynch, a fellow zookeeper at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI). “It’s amazing, what Chris has accomplished with Walnut,” Lynch says. “This isn’t something just anyone can do.”

When Walnut arrived at the Front Royal, Virginia, endangered species breeding centre, back in 2004, she was the most genetically valuable white-naped crane in captivity. At 23, she had yet to produce a single chick, and she had a reputation for murdering her mates. Two male cranes that made amorous overtures towards Walnut had been found dead, with their bellies sliced open by her sharp claws. That, at least, was the rumour, Lynch says.

Crowe, SCBI’s newest keeper, was assigned to the case. “Walnut had this whole ‘black widow’ thing going,” Lynch recalls. “I told Chris, ‘Be careful with this one’.” He would be so careful, in fact, so thoughtful and patient and understanding, that whether Walnut would become pregnant would be just one part of what transpired between them. Because the larger story was how Chris Crowe won over Walnut’s wild heart.

Walnut hatched on 2 July 1981, in an old horse barn in Baraboo, Wisconsin. She was the seventh white-naped crane born at the International Crane Foundation (ICF) that summer, so her arrival went largely unheralded, says ICF cofounder George Archibald. Volunteers named her, somewhat randomly, after their favourite dessert at a nearby diner, a walnut cream pie.

The foundation was in full-tilt crane-making mode, trying to churn out as many of the rare animals as possible, recalls former ICF ornithologist Michael Putnam. When a pair of cranes produced eggs, staff would put the eggs in an incubator, which would prompt the pair to make more.

Walnut’s parents, Mercury and Amazon, were happy to oblige. The handsome birds were famous at the ICF for producing loads of eggs, and also for their unusual origins. While most of the centre’s cranes were born in captivity, Mercury and Amazon were wild-caught birds. Captured illegally in China and smuggled to Hong Kong, the two cranes were probably en route to a private menagerie, or perhaps a taxidermist, Archibald says. Instead, they were intercepted by local authorities and eventually shipped to the ICF.

Though it would have been better to return the birds to the wild, international tensions in 1978 made that impossible, Putnam recalls. Plus, no one knew exactly where in China they had been captured, or what the birds might have been exposed to during transit. “We didn’t want to release birds that might carry diseases and put them back into the wild flock,” Putnam says.

This kind of poaching is less common today, but the white-naped crane population is falling fast because of a more relentless foe: booming human populations, which are overtaking, polluting or draining the wetlands that the birds need to survive. “One pair of cranes, to breed, usually requires huge wetland areas,” Archibald says. “It may be several acres, it may be several hundred acres.”

She came right up and was doing all sorts of displays. I didn’t quite understand at that point, but they were territorial Chris Crowe

In addition to demanding vast areas of untrammelled wilderness, these difficult birds seem almost drawn to marginal places. For instance, one of the white-naped cranes’ most important wintering grounds is the 2.5 mile wide demilitarised zone that separates North and South Korea. There, in a strange, de facto nature preserve, white-naped cranes and their even more endangered cousins, red-crowned cranes, root for tubers among the land mines they are too light to trigger. If tensions between the Koreas subside, however, the cranes will be in trouble. Farmers are already clamouring for access to the nutrient-rich land, and developers are planning for a reunification city and deepwater port.

As conservationists work to persuade people to preserve land for cranes, zoos are pursuing a parallel strategy. They are breeding captive white-naped cranes, creating an “insurance population”, ready to be reintroduced should their wild counterparts disappear. But the problem with captive populations of animals is that they tend to get inbred, which is why – in 1981 – keepers were thrilled to have the genes of Mercury and Amazon to add to the mix.

The pair didn’t seem to mind being transplanted from China to Wisconsin. Maybe the glacier-sculpted landscape of Baraboo felt familiar to the birds, or maybe Mercury and Amazon just decided to make the best of a strange situation. In any case, the two wowed ICF staff with their exuberant courtship displays – running, bowing, leaping and trumpeting their love for each other all summer long. That year, they produced nine chicks, including Walnut.

These wobbly baby birds were raised in small herds, minded by so called chick mamas who fed them, cleaned their pens and took them out to a horse ring for daily exercise and to a baby pool for swimming lessons. The chick mamas were mostly volunteers, says Joan Fordham, a former ICF employee. Fordham’s 10-year-old daughter was a chick mama one summer, and she apparently didn’t get a lot of training. “If the cranes started fighting, she knew how to separate them, and that was pretty much it,” Fordham recalls.

Standards for raising cranes have changed since then. Now, highly trained zookeepers take care of the birds, and chicks are either left with their parents or raised by foster parent cranes, if at all possible. That’s because the job of crane parent is more nuanced than we humans once realised. Cranes have elaborate body language and sophisticated hunting techniques – skills that chicks learn, at least in part, from observing their parents. In addition, if a captive-born chick is slated to be released into the wild, a fear of humans is crucial to their survival.

But perhaps the biggest reason crane chicks shouldn’t be hand-reared is the possibility that they may “imprint” on humans. When it’s time to find a suitable mate, some human-imprinted cranes seek out a partner that looks like their presumed parent – a human, instead of another bird. This, it seems, is what happened with Walnut.

Even back in the 1980s, crane keepers knew about the hazards of imprinting, and they took measures to make sure baby cranes saw plenty of other birds – by housing them in groups, for instance, and with mirrors. Some of the chicks, however, were intent on pecking their siblings to death, and they had to be separated from the others. Walnut might have been one such bird, Archibald thinks; he doesn’t know for sure because, like all of Walnut’s keepers before Crowe, he doesn’t remember Walnut specifically. “Probably she was alone and somebody paid too much attention to her,” Archibald says.

Bridging a 320 million year evolutionary divide, Walnut likely made some human fall in love with her. This volunteer must have been very motherly indeed, posits Lynch. “I can only imagine that when someone hand-raised her, they perhaps even carried her around like a baby or something,” he says. “I’ve just never seen a bird that strongly imprinted.”

This relationship, however well meaning, doomed Walnut to a life of loneliness. Cranes, which mate for life, are happiest when housed in pairs. Walnut was transferred to the Denver Zoo and then the Cincinnati Zoo, but keepers were never able to find her a mate. Somewhere along the line, she acquired her murderous reputation, though no zoo would admit to letting rare cranes die on their watch. Still, SCBI staff say the rumours are probably true.

Whether or not Walnut was killing her fellow cranes, she certainly wasn’t contributing to her species’ survival – which is why, in October 2004, she was transferred to SCBI for one last chance at motherhood.

On his first week of work, in December 2004, Crowe met his new charges: 17 cranes and 36 ducks. Even among all these animals, Walnut stood out. Instead of hiding from Crowe like most of the other birds, she fearlessly walked to the chain-link fence separating them, ruffled her feathers and growled. “She came right up and was doing all sorts of displays,” he recalls. “I didn’t quite understand at that point, but they were territorial.” It was around then that Crowe’s colleague Warren Lynch mentioned Walnut’s (allegedly) murderous past.

Crowe knew to give all the cranes a wide berth. Though they look practically ethereal – weightless clouds of feathers on reed-thin legs – cranes are known for rending clothes and skin with precisely aimed claws. For a crane keeper, even mundane chores like cleaning out food bowls are edged with danger.

As winter shaded into spring, Carol Hesch, assistant curator at the Memphis Zoo and keeper of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ white-naped crane studbook, consulted a genetic database and determined that Walnut should be bred with Ray, a comely male crane two yards over. Ray, however, was already paired with Abigail; if they tried to put Walnut and Ray together, feathers would fly, so to speak. So, the plan was to use artificial insemination, a stressful procedure that requires capturing the birds and holding them down for minutes at a time.

One day that March, Crowe and Lynch entered Walnut’s cage and herded her into a corner. The moment Walnut looked away, Lynch grabbed her body underneath her wings. Then, he stepped over the bird and held her between his legs, facing backward. Kneeling behind her, Crowe began massaging Walnut’s cloaca – an all-purpose orifice that birds use for defecation as well as reproduction – and applied gentle pressure to her back, mimicking the weight of a male crane. Walnut purred, her cloaca opened, and Crowe injected semen that the two zookeepers had collected, in much the same way, from Ray.

A few weeks later, Walnut laid two fertilised eggs, which Crowe stole and placed in Ray and Abigail’s nest. That was necessary because, in the wild, cranes take turns incubating their eggs, and Crowe didn’t want Walnut to shoulder that burden alone. “It’s just too much for her,” he says, “and I don’t want to sit on it myself.”

Plus, it was becoming clear to Crowe that Walnut did not see herself as a crane and might not recognise baby cranes as her own. In fact, one young male crane with a clear view of Walnut was always trying to get her attention, with head bobs and calls. Walnut wasn’t having any of it. “She just gave him the stink eye,” Crowe says.

That summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings – motions that Crowe now recognises as the first moves of a mating dance. “At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,” Crowe says. “But then I’d see the other pairs doing the same things, and it kind of dawned on me.”

Crowe accepted Walnut’s invitation to dance. Though he felt a little silly, he bobbed his head when Walnut bobbed hers, and raised and lowered his arms like wings. The two circled each other, and sometimes Walnut would make a loud, trumpeting call – the beginning of the white-naped crane love duet. If no one was around, Crowe would try to do the male part of the song – making a Homer Simpson-like “woohoo” – but Walnut never found his efforts satisfactory.

As the weather cooled, so did Walnut’s ardour. But in the spring, Walnut began greeting her keeper with bows again. This gave Crowe an idea: If Walnut thought he was her mate, maybe Crowe could make that year’s artificial insemination less stressful for both of them. “If we could get her able to do it without catching her, there’s no stress, no risk of injury,” Crowe says. “It’s much better for us and for the crane.” Lynch agrees. “As far as we knew, it had never been done before, but it seemed like a good thing to try,” he recalls.

In fact, at least one man had “mated” with a crane before. Back in 1982, ICF’s George Archibald bonded with a whooping crane named Tex. Like Walnut, Tex had imprinted on humans, so Archibald decided to become her mate, artificially inseminate her and add one precious chick to the critically endangered whooping crane population. For three months, Archibald camped next to Tex’s yard and bonded with the bird by mimicking her dance moves. Keeping up with Tex required some real athleticism, Archibald says. “I would run around with her and leap into the air,” he recalls, “and it was very exhausting, actually. It was good exercise.”

Archibald knew all the cranes’ moves because he had studied crane behaviour for his PhD at Cornell University. Crowe, in contrast, learned how to woo Walnut by watching a pair of particularly amorous white-naped cranes named Brenda and Eddie, who also lived at SCBI. Brenda seemed to really like it when Eddie brought her material for their nest, so Crowe started bringing sticks and straw to Walnut. Sometimes she rejected Crowe’s offerings outright, tossing the sticks right out of the nest. “She’s real particular about the length and circumference of the sticks, and it changes from year to year,” Crowe says. When Crowe got it right, Walnut was clearly delighted.

Even though Crowe had proved his interior decorating skills, Walnut wouldn’t allow him to touch her – a key step in artificial insemination. So Crowe started training her to tolerate his touch. Reaching his arm out slowly, he’d graze Walnut’s tail feathers with his fingertips and then immediately reward her with a dead mouse, Walnut’s favourite treat. Eventually, Walnut allowed Crowe to pet her entire back, and she seemed to enjoy it, purring like a contented cat.

One day, after some back petting, Walnut turned away from Crowe, extended her wings, and raised her tail – an invitation to mate. Walnut was asking Crowe to flutter to her back and perform what’s poetically known as a “cloacal kiss”. Crowe recalls being both startled and amused. “It’s what I had been working towards and hoping for, but it was still surprising when it happened,” he says. Composing himself, Crowe put a hand on Walnut’s back and then rubbed her thighs, going through the motions of artificial insemination. This would prepare both of them for the real thing, come the following March.

Unfortunately, Walnut found Crowe to be a disappointing lover, at least at first. “I would start massaging her back, where the male crane would be perched when he’s copulating, but then I had to stop momentarily to start massaging other areas, and she would stop soliciting and walk away,” he says. “It took a little time for me to figure out to have one hand on one spot and another hand on the other spot, and for her to stay with it if I took my hands off her temporarily.”

I thought, if we’re causing all those extinctions and endangerments, then we are also the solution. We should be responsible for the solution, since we are causing the problem to begin with Chris Crowe

Once the two got their routine down, it was time to try again. In March 2007, Crowe and Lynch captured Ray and collected semen, and then Crowe injected it into Walnut by himself, with her willing participation.

Walnut and Crowe would go on to produce five chicks this way – a major boon for the captive white-naped crane population, Lynch says. That also means Walnut’s rare genes are no longer in danger of dying with her, which is why, in 2008, a crane named Amanda stole Walnut’s title as the most genetically valuable crane in captivity. Like Walnut, Amanda had few relatives and no offspring, so she was sent to SCBI to see if Crowe could work his magic again. He succeeded, so then he was sent another difficult female, a young crane named Wucheng.

“The training went much quicker with Amanda and Wucheng – I think because Walnut had kind of trained me,” Crowe says. Amanda was eventually paired successfully with a male crane, and Wucheng seems to be able to bond with both humans and cranes, so she, too, will probably be matched with another bird. But as far as Walnut is concerned, Crowe is her mate for life.

A quiet, watchful child, Chris Crowe always felt a special kinship with animals. And though he grew up among the strip malls and subdivisions of Rockville, Maryland, he found wildlife nearly everywhere he looked. “I’d feed the squirrels in the yard, or if there was a baby bird out of the nest, I’d bring it home, raise it, cut up worms for it, things like that,” he says. Crowe realises now that he probably should have left the birds where he found them. Fledglings look awkward and helpless, but it’s a normal stage of bird development. Their parents keep feeding them, sometimes for weeks after they leave the nest. When well meaning humans scoop them up, it’s usually bad news for the birds.

When Crowe was seven, while on a family vacation at Yellowstone National Park, his love for animals transformed into a lifelong calling. “My dad picked me up and walked me up to a bison, which is not the safest thing to do. And I started crying. I was scared and upset,” Crowe recalls. “My dad made some joke. He said, ‘If he charges you, stand your ground and I’ll run and get the car.’ I think that snapped me out of the crying in fear.” At that moment, Crowe saw the bison for what it was: “I started looking at its big, glossy eyes and twitching ears and wet nose, and I realised there’s a real being there, a real creature, a thinking, feeling animal.”

Later, on that same trip, he read about how 19th-century settlers nearly drove the bison to extinction. “I was horrified that people would do that,” he says. That realisation was quickly followed by another, one that set the course for Crowe’s career and life. “I thought, if we’re causing all those extinctions and endangerments, then we are also the solution,” he says. “We should be responsible for the solution, since we are causing the problem to begin with.”

After graduating from Virginia Tech in 1998, Crowe won internships at Blackwater and Patuxent national wildlife refuges, where he tallied wild birds and kept an eye on nesting wood ducks. Then, he got what he calls his big break: working at a California condor reintroduction programme. For a year, Crowe drove and hiked the vast desert surrounding the Grand Canyon, searching for condors that had been recently reintroduced. The inexperienced, young birds were just learning to soar and scavenge, and Crowe’s job was to bring them extra meat and flush them away from unsafe roosts.

He went on to work on a wolf reintroduction programme in North Carolina, then a shorebird research programme in North Dakota. Eventually, he landed back at Patuxent, where he was assigned to help raise whooping cranes. His job in 2003 was similar to that of the crane mamas that raised Walnut in 1981, but the rules for interacting with the chicks had become much stricter. To keep the cranes from imprinting on humans or becoming tame, Crowe wore a crane costume, and he never spoke words to the chicks. “If you wanted to talk to them, you had to make crane noises. If they were misbehaving or not paying attention, I’d just have to go, ‘Brrr, brrrr,’” says Crowe, demonstrating a sound like a trumpet player warming up. “Just like kids, they’d turn and look at you and stop fighting or goofing off or whatever they were doing.”

Crowe likes birds, but his dream job would be to work on another wolf reintroduction programme. Unfortunately, those jobs are hard to come by, because releasing pointy-toothed carnivores tends to be politically controversial. “A lot of people are afraid of wolves, though they really shouldn’t be,” he says.

Crane reintroduction programmes, on the other hand, are an easier sell. These graceful creatures awe us with their ability to cross continents and oceans, Archibald says. Saving them is “like saving a great work of art”. Plus, their magnetic beauty makes them excellent “umbrella species” – charismatic megafauna that inspire people to conserve entire ecosystems.

Crowe’s job with the whooping cranes at Patuxent was only seasonal, so when a permanent crane keeper position opened up at SCBI, he applied. And that’s when Crowe met Walnut.

Captive cranes can live past 60 years, which means Crowe’s commitment to Walnut could, in theory, last decades. “If she’s still here when I’m eligible for retirement, I won’t be able to leave,” he says. “I’d feel like a jerk.” Another male keeper – and Walnut clearly prefers men to women – might be able to woo her if Crowe were to disappear. But, as Crowe has seen with his other cranes, the loss of a mate is traumatic. Widowed cranes stop eating and fill the air with mournful calls, sometimes for weeks on end.

It’s unlikely that Walnut will be called on to produce more chicks, but Crowe continues to dance with her and even “mate” with her when she asks. It’s a strange job, but Crowe says he’s used to getting teased at this point. “I’ve heard every joke,” he says, and then shares his favourite: “What’s the difference between erotic and kinky? Erotic, you use a feather. Kinky, you use the whole bird.”

The best jokes, however, Crowe makes at his own expense. When I ask him if he has a partner, and if she or he is jealous of Walnut, Crowe responds with a disarming quip: “Walnut sets the bar pretty high. I’ll never find a woman that’s so happy to see me that she just starts dancing.”

Like an old couple, Crowe and Walnut have fallen into a comfortable routine. After “mating” with Crowe, Walnut will often lay unfertilised eggs. Crowe replaces them with fake ones; the real ones would rot and get eaten by crows, which would prompt Walnut to lay more. The bird then spends long hours sitting on the dummy eggs, so Crowe helps her out whenever he gets the chance. “I go over and stand near the nest and I say, ‘You take a break.’ And she’ll wander off. She’ll go down into the creek and take a bath. Then she walks back after 15 or 20 minutes, and she’s ready to sit back on the nest again.”

Though he does his best to not be a deadbeat dad, Crowe knows he falls short of crane standards. These are creatures that, once paired up, rarely lose sight of their partner; Crowe, in contrast, disappears every weekend. But despite Crowe’s shortcomings, Walnut loves him unconditionally. In fact, this 12-pound bird’s capacity for boundless affection sets a standard that we all could learn from, Crowe says. “The ideal partner doesn’t exist. You have to accept certain things that people can’t change,” he explains. “I mean, she puts up with me even though I can’t dance or sing.”

Crowe is proud of his groundbreaking work with cranes, but he admits that sometimes the whole project feels futile. White-naped cranes are continuing to decline in the wild, and many other species appear headed towards extinction. The heart of the matter, it seems, is that most people don’t share Crowe’s conviction that animals are thinking, feeling individuals. That they have just as legitimate a claim on this planet as we humans do.

How do we bridge the ever-widening gap that separates us from the environment, other animals and even one another? Maybe, Crowe and Walnut are demonstrating – and my apologies to The Beatles – that all you need is love. After all, what ultimately drives even the most scientific, tough-minded conservation efforts is an irrational, big-hearted embrace of a wilderness that’s coldly indifferent to us, an impossible connection we feel to animals that we can never truly understand. All this time, we heavy-headed primates assumed our brains held all the solutions, but maybe our hearts can be a better guide.

0,"Lemurs are the now the most threatened mammal group on the planet, according to conservationists who issued a warning about the animals this month.

Out of 111 known lemur species and subspecies, at least 105 — 95 percent — are now considered to be threatened with extinction.

All lemur species are native to the island nation of Madagascar, where they are threatened by habitat loss, deforestation, hunting for meat, the illegal pet trade and other factors.

“The world loves lemurs, but the government of Madagascar pays very little attention,” says Russ Mittermeier, chief conservation officer for Global Wildlife Conservation and chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group, which conducted the new assessment of lemur species at a recent workshop.

According to the analysis, at least 38 lemur species should now be listed as “critically endangered,” up from 24 when the primates were last assessed back in 2012. Another 44 should be considered “endangered,” while 23 are thought to be slightly safer and have been categorized as “vulnerable to extinction.” Only two lemur species, both widespread mouse lemurs, were considered to be of “least concern,” the healthiest assessment category on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Among the most threatened of these popular animals are both the largest and smallest lemur species, the 2-foot-tall indri (Indri indri) and the Madame Berthe’s mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae), which, at about 1 ounce in weight, is also the world’s smallest known primate. The rarest lemur is now the northern sportive lemur (Lepilemur septentrionalis), which has an estimated population of just 50 individuals.

The famous ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), the most common primate in captivity around the world, is expected to now be listed as “endangered.” Recent research estimates that populations for this species have fallen by as much as 95 percent since the year 2000.

These new assessments are considered provisional and will take another few years to finalize, but Mittermeier says lemurs need action now: “We don’t want to wait two or three years for the final results to come out because it’s too urgent.”

Mittermeier says the Madagascar government has been too besieged over the past few years by a coup and other political crises to accomplish much in the name of conservation. He says the country’s current president, Hery Rajaonarimampianina, “is a good guy, but now we have a new election coming up and it’s heavily focused on politics and the capital city and the rest of the country be damned, which is really too bad.”

Lemurs have been on decline since long before the coup, but we’ve also been learning more about them the whole time. Mittermeier points out that science had only described 60 lemur species when the first field guide to the animals was published in 1994. Nearly that many new species have been discovered since then, including one that was just described this past January. Mittermeier expects the total number will continue to grow, as several species are even now awaiting formal scientific description. “We’re going to add at least 5 to 10 percent more species in the next few years,” he says.

Unfortunately, the improved knowledge has corresponded with the destruction of much of Madagascar’s native forests. “Even as we describe new species, the available range for every species has become smaller,” Mittermeier says. “Some of the new species have no habitat protection whatsoever.”

So what can be done to help lemurs? “Ecotourism is the number-one conservation tool right now,” Mittermeier says, because it supports both protected areas and the people who live near them. “The answer is empowering the communities and getting more and more people going there and showing the benefits of establishing protected areas to communities,” he says. “That’s about the best thing we can do at this point.”

Along these lines, the IUCN Species Survival Commission has raised $8 million for lemur conservation and is in the process of distributing grants for on-the-ground efforts. “That’ll go toward the communities and tourism operations and things like that,” Mittermeier says.

He also points to the Lemur Conservation Network, which links the efforts of more than 50 conservation organizations, research groups and zoos and implements the lemur survival action plan.

Beyond, that, Mittermeier says he hopes other conservation groups and governments will follow up with similar targeted efforts, including aid packages that require the government of Madagascar to rigorously commit to conservation, including to help not just lemurs but also to end the rampant illegal trade in tortoises and rosewood.

How does Mittermeier himself deal with the increasingly bad news about lemurs? “Look, I’m an eternal optimist,” he says. “I just keep pushing and plugging away. If there’s a failure, you just regroup. If you have an obstacle put in front of you, you either knock it down or move around it. These are wonderful animals and we’re working together to save them.”",Lemurs in Crisis: 105 Species Now Threatened with Extinction • The Revelator,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmV2ZWxhdG9yLm9yZy9sZW11cnMtY3Jpc2lzLWV4dGluY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://therevelator.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Indri-in-Analamazaotra-Special-Reserve-Andasibe-Madagascar-photo-by-Russ-Mittermeier-cropped.jpg,2018-08-09,"{'sent': 'Out of 111 known lemur species and subspecies, at least 105 — 95 percent — are now considered to be threatened with extinction.\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['111', 'at least 105']}}","Lemurs are the now the most threatened mammal group on the planet, according to conservationists who issued a warning about the animals this month.

Engineer Walter Ruizo, head of the Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Office (MENRO), issued a cease and desist order on Aug. 8 ending a “treasure hunt” in a lot owned by the 45-year-old resident Cristina Escoto.

Some villagers reported the illegal activity to the MENRO, Ruizo said.

MENRO personnel, Makilala town police head Chief Inspector Johnny Rick Medel and forest ranger Avelino Banac went to the village and found a 20-meter-deep excavation on Esocoto’s lot.

The excavation – which was conducted using a backhoe without permits – was about 20 meters from a riverbank, said Ruizo.

Escoto denied the treasure hunt. She said the excavation was made for a swimming pool construction.

Ruizo reminded the public that unauthorized excavations pose danger to human life and the environment.

“Such digging may trigger soil erosion or landslides,” he said.

The MENRO chief also cited Presidential Decree 1067, which prohibits digging in the so-called “riparian zone” – the boundary between land and a river or stream.

Ruizo said Escoto has agreed to stop the digging and vowed to return the dug soil.

For the first time since its inception in 1933, the French clothing brand Lacoste replaced its iconic crocodile logo with 10 endangered animals including Sumatran Tiger and Anegada Rock Iguana.

Launched at Paris Fashion Week, the Save Our Species campaign represented a novel and inspiring way to raise awareness and engagement in species conservation.

Later, global fitness brand Reebok announced its Cotton + Corn sustainable products initiative, which introduced plant-based footwear to the market.

Going Green

The trend of sustainable fashion is on a roll. Small brands are joining the league of global giants to adopt green initiatives for the good of the environment. American market research company NPD conducted a survey in July to gauge the popularity of sustainable fashion in the US. Nearly a quarter of responders said they have purchased clothing that was either “sustainable,” “eco-friendly,” “organic” or “ethical”. This number increases to 30 percent when looking at younger responders (18-34-year-olds).

“The higher interest from younger consumers does not surprise me given these are generations that grew up well informed on social causes. What does surprise me is that nearly a third was not sure if they ever purchased these types of clothing, indicating a need for clearer messaging,” Maria Rugolo, apparel industry analyst at NPD Group says in the company blog

Designing For Sustainability

Here are some brands in the Asia-Pacific region that are leading the way for sustainable fashion:

Seattle-based startup Girlfriend Collective has created full-length leggings with material made of 25 recycled water bottles.

“There is a disturbing trend in 'recycled' fabric production where some facilities will purchase unused water bottles to turn a higher profit. Our center is monitored by the Taiwanese government recycling authority to ensure that only used water bottles go into our leggings,” the company said in a blog post.

The bottles are sorted into their respective categories and then sent to the processing centers in Taiwan. The leggings and bras are made Polyethylene Terephthalate, also known as PET.

Luxury brand Stella McCartney’s commitment to sustainability is evident in their collections. A lifelong vegetarian designer Stella McCartney does not use any leather or fur in her designs. The brand’s new hi-tech trainers aim to combat the effect shoe production on the environment. The smart shoe has been created using eco-friendly materials and is fully recyclable. Her collections include women’s and men’s ready-to-wear, accessories, lingerie, eyewear, fragrance and kids. Stella McCartney now operates 51 freestanding stores in locations including Manhattan’s Soho, London’s Mayfair and Brompton Cross, LA’s West Hollywood, Paris’ Palais Royal, Milan, Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing.

Similarly, Bali-based jewelry and clothing brand designs jewelry from sustainable and recycled materials. Founded by Christina Zipperlen, created the company’s silver jewelry is recycled with a green certificate, ensuring a clean waste process. The cotton in their apparel is certified organic with low-impact plant-based dies.

“Being based in Southeast Asia, we are more directly exposed to the results of pollution and toxic waste, feeling a powerful urgency to have a positive impact on the environment through the work we do,” the company said in a blogpost.

Another Singapore-based brand designs jewelry using eco-friendly bioresin and eco-materials. As opposed to traditional resins that are composed primarily of petroleum-based materials, bioresins contain biobased renewable materials sourced as co-products or from waste streams of other industrial processes, such as wood pulp and bio-fuels production.

0,"AsianScientist (Sep. 6, 2018) – In a study published in the Journal of Orthoptera Research, a research group in Singapore reported that grasshoppers and crickets play an important role as pollinators in nature.

Pollination is crucial for plant reproduction and supplying food crops for human consumption. Bees and butterflies are well known pollinators, but insects such as grasshoppers and crickets (orthopterans) are often thought of as pests that feed on and damage plants.

However, in a study led by Associate Professor Hugh Tan at the National University of Singapore, researchers showed that not all orthopterans are bad for agriculture. To better understand the roles that orthopterans play in pollination ecology, the research team conducted field surveys across different vegetation and localities in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei Darussalam and Indonesia between 2015 and 2018. The study involved both day and night surveys during which flower-visiting orthopterans were searched and recorded using photographs and videos.

The team recorded 140 incidences of orthopterans visiting flowers across the sites surveyed, among which 41 orthopteran species visited the flowers of 35 plant species. Out of the 41 species, 19 species were katydids, 13 were grasshoppers and nine were crickets.

The researchers also discovered two main categories of flower-visiting orthopterans. The first category consists of katydids that are floriphilic, which means they clearly prefer flowers over other plant parts as their diet. On the other hand, the second category comprises opportunistic folivores such as cone-headed katydids (Conocephalus species) and Bukit Timah’s cricket (Tremellia timah), which typically consume leaves, but consume flower matter when it is available.

The scientists also conducted experiments in which the flowers were exposed to the katydids and allowed to develop into seeds. They found that the chance of these flowers eventually producing seeds was about three times higher.

“Without such studies, it is not possible to assess the risks presented by these potential pest species, as well as to further examine the beneficial roles of the flower-visiting orthopterans,” explained Tan. “Our findings suggest that current knowledge of orthopterans as flower-visitors and their role in pollination ecology is still in its infancy.”

The researchers hope to conduct more studies to better understand how orthopterans can function both as pollinators and harmful plant-eaters, and how these unconventional pollinators co-evolve with plants.

0,"ILOILO – A foreign seabird classified as among migratory species needing tougher protection had been sighted in Dumangas town.

The July 20 sighting was the first recorded visit of the Christmas frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi) in Panay Island.

Philip Godfrey Jakosalem and Liza Paguntalan of the Philippines Biodiversity Conservation Foundation, Inc. and Arne Jensen of Wild Bird Club of the Philippines, Inc. validated and confirmed the identity of the bird.

“We at the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) are doing all our efforts to strengthen the conservation and protection of our migratory birds,” Regional Director Jim O Sampulna said.

“This is the second first-record we have. Last year we have recorded the first sighting of the Brent Goose (Branta bernicla nigricans),” said Sampulna.

Andre Bonnie Balderas and Nelson Rondan of the Panay Bird Club saw the Christmas frigatebird soaring in the air over the coastal road in Dumangas.

Christmas frigatebirds are “critically endangered,” their population trend decreasing, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

A seabird of the frigatebird family Fregatidae, Christmas frigatebirds are endemic to Christmas Island, Australia in the Indian Ocean.

They are a regular visitor of the Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park in Palawan province and the Tawi-Tawi groups of islands.

The species has a small population and breeds on just one island. Reaching 89-100 centimeters (35-39 inches) long, the bird has a wingspan of 205-230 centimeters (81-91 inches) and weighs around 1,550 grams (3.42 pounds).

0,"Deep in the Amazon rainforest live two green birds. The snow-capped manakin, has a splash of white on its head. The opal-crowned manakin looks very similar. But this species’ crown can appear white, blue or red depending on the light. It’s “like a rainbow,” says Alfredo Barrera-Guzmán. He is a biologist at the Autonomous University of Yucatán in Mérida, Mexico.

Univ. of Toronto Scarborough Feathers from the opal-crowned manakin’s head can appear blue, white or red depending on the light (left). The snow-capped manakin has white crown feathers (center). A hybrid species of the two, the golden-crowned manakin, developed a yellow head (right).

Thousands of years ago, these two species of birds started mating with each other. The offspring initially had crowns that were dull whitish-grey, Barrera-Guzmán suspects. But in later generations, some birds grew yellow feathers. This bright color made males more attractive to females. Those females may have preferred mating with yellow-capped males rather than snow-capped or opal-crowned males.

Eventually, those birds became separate enough from the two original species to be their own, distinct species: the golden-crowned manakin. It’s the first-known case of a hybrid bird species in the Amazon, he says.

Usually, different species don’t mate. But when they do, their offspring will be what are called hybrids.

The molecules of DNA in each of an animal’s cells hold instructions. These guide what an animal looks like, how it behaves and the sounds it makes. When animals mate, their young get a mixture of the parents’ DNA. And they can end up with a mixture of the parents’ traits.

If the parents are from the same species, their DNA is very similar. But DNA from different species or species groups will have more variations. Hybrid offspring get more variety in the DNA they inherit.

So what happens when the DNA of two animal groups mix in a hybrid? There are many possible outcomes. Sometimes the hybrid is weaker than the parents, or doesn’t even survive. Sometimes it’s stronger. Sometimes it behaves more like one parent species than the other. And sometimes its behavior falls somewhere in between that of each parent.

Scientists are trying to understand how this process — called hybridization (HY-brih-dih-ZAY-shun) — plays out. Hybrid birds may take new migration routes, they found. Some hybrid fish appear more vulnerable to predators. And rodents’ mating habits may affect what their hybrid offspring can eat.

Maya Faccio; Fabio Olmos; Alfredo Barrera Two bird species, the snow-capped manakin (left) and opal-crowned manakin (right), mated to produce hybrids. The hybrids eventually became their own species, the golden-crowned manakin (center).

Wise to hybridize?

Hybridization happens for many reasons. For instance, the territory of two similar types of animals may overlap. This happens with polar and grizzly bears. Members of the two groups of animals have mated, producing hybrid bears.

When the climate changes, a species’ habitat can shift to a new area. These animals may encounter other, similar species. The two groups may mate by accident. For instance, researchers have found hybrids of southern flying squirrels and northern flying squirrels. As the climate warmed, the southern species moved north and mated with the other species.

When animals can’t find enough mates from their own species, they may select a mate from another species. “You have to make the best out of the situation,” says Kira Delmore. She is a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany.

Scientists have seen this happen with two antelope species in southern Africa. Poachers had thinned out the populations of giant sable antelope and roan antelope. Later, the two species bred with each other.

People can unwittingly create opportunities for hybridization, too. They might put two closely related species in the same enclosure at a zoo. Or as cities expand, urban species may increasingly encounter rural ones. People may even set loose animals from other countries, accidentally or on purpose, into a new habitat. These exotic species now may encounter and mate with the native animals.

Many hybrid animals are sterile. That means they may be able to mate, but they won’t create offspring. For example, mules are the hybrid offspring of horses and donkeys. Most of these are sterile: Two mules can’t make more mules. Only a horse mating with a donkey can make another mule.

Biodiversity is a measure of the number of species. In the past, many scientists assumed that hybridization wasn’t good for biodiversity. If many hybrids were produced, the two parent species could merge into one. That would reduce the variety of species. That’s why “hybridization was often viewed as a bad thing,” Delmore explains.

But hybridization sometimes can boost biodiversity. A hybrid might be able to eat a certain food that its parent species cannot. Or maybe it can thrive in a different habitat. Eventually, it could become its own species, like the golden-crowned manakin. And that would increase — not decrease — the variety of life on Earth. Hybridization, Delmore concludes, is “actually a creative force.”

Going their own way

Hybrids can be different from their parents in many ways. Appearance is just one. Delmore wanted to know how hybrids might behave differently than their parents. She looked to a songbird called the Swainson’s thrush.

Over time, this species has split into subspecies. These are groups of animals from the same species that live in different areas. However, when they do encounter each other, they can still breed and produce fertile young.

One subspecies is the russet-backed thrush, which lives on the west coast of the United States and Canada. As its name implies, it has reddish feathers. The olive-backed thrush has greenish-brown feathers and lives farther inland. But these subspecies overlap along the Coast Mountains in western North America. There, they can mate and produce hybrids.

One difference between the two subspecies is their migration behavior. Both groups of birds breed in North America, then fly south in winter. But russet-backed thrushes migrate down the west coast to land in Mexico and Central America. Olive-backed thrushes fly over the central and eastern United States to settle in South America. Their routes are “super different,” Delmore says.

K. Delmore Scientists attached tiny backpacks (as seen on this bird) to hybrid songbirds called thrushes. The backpacks contained devices that helped the researchers track the birds’ migration routes.

The birds’ DNA contains instructions for where to fly. Which directions do hybrids get? To investigate, Delmore trapped hybrid birds in western Canada. She placed tiny backpacks on them. A light sensor in each backpack helped record where the birds went. The birds flew south to their wintering grounds, carrying the backpacks on their journey.

The next summer, Delmore re-captured some of those birds back in Canada. From the sensors’ light data, she figured out what time the sun had risen and set at each point along the bird’s journey. The length of the day and timing of midday differs depending on location. That helped Delmore deduce the birds’ migration paths.

Some hybrids roughly followed one of their parents’ routes. But others didn’t take either path. They flew somewhere down the middle. These treks, though, took the birds over rougher terrain, such as deserts and mountains. That could be a problem because those environments might offer less food to survive the long journey.

Another group of hybrids took the olive-backed thrush’s route south. Then they returned via the russet-backed thrush’s path. But that strategy might also cause problems. Normally, birds learn cues on their way south to help them navigate back home. They might notice landmarks such as mountains. But if they return by a different path, those landmarks will be absent. One result: The birds migration might take longer to complete.

These new data might explain why the subspecies have remained separate, Delmore says. Following a different path may mean that hybrid birds tend to be weaker when they reach the mating grounds — or have a lower chance of surviving their yearly journeys. If hybrids survived as well as their parents, DNA from the two subspecies would mix more often. Eventually these subspecies would fuse into one group. “Differences in migration could be helping these guys maintain differences,” Delmore concludes.

Perils of predators

Sometimes, hybrids are shaped differently than their parents. And that can affect how well they avoid predators.

Anders Nilsson recently stumbled onto this finding. He is a biologist at Lund University in Sweden. In 2005, his team was studying two fish species named common bream and roach (not to be confused with the insect). Both fish live in a lake in Denmark and migrate into streams during winter.

To study their behavior, Nilsson and his colleagues implanted tiny electronic tags in the fish. These tags allowed the scientists to track the fish’s movements. The team used a device that broadcast a radio signal. Tags that received the signal sent back one of their own that the team could detect.

At first, Nilsson’s team was interested only in roach and bream. But the researchers noticed other fish that looked like something in between. The main difference was their body shape. Viewed from the side, the bream appears diamond-shaped with a taller middle than its ends. The roach is more streamlined. It’s closer to a slim oval. The third fish’s shape was somewhere between those two.

Christian Skov Two fish species, the common bream (left) and roach (right), can mate to produce hybrids (center). The hybrid’s body shape is somewhere in between its parent species’ shapes.

“To the untrained eye, they just look like fish,” Nilsson admits. “But to a fish person, they are hugely different.”

Roach and bream must have mated to produce those in-between fish, the scientists thought. That would make those fish hybrids. And so the team began tagging those fish, too.

Fish-eating birds called great cormorants live in the same area as the fish. Other scientists were studying the cormorants’ predation of trout and salmon. Nilsson’s team wondered if the birds were eating roach, bream and hybrids as well.

Aron Hejdström Here’s a roost for birds called cormorants. Researchers found that these birds were more likely to eat hybrid fish than either species of the parent fish.

Cormorants gobble fish whole. Afterward, they spit out unwanted parts — including electronic tags. A few years after the researchers had tagged the fish, they visited the cormorants’ nesting and roosting sites. The birds’ homes were pretty gross. “They throw up and defecate all over the place,” Nilsson says. “It’s not pretty.”

But the researchers’ search was worth it. They found a lot of fish tags in the birds’ mess. And the hybrids appeared to fare the worst. For their efforts, the team found 9 percent of the bream tags and 14 percent of the roach tags. But 41 percent of the hybrids’ tags also turned up in the nests.

Nilsson isn’t sure why hybrids are more likely to be eaten. But perhaps their shape makes them easier targets. Its diamond-like shape makes bream hard to swallow. The roach’s streamlined body helps it quickly swim away from danger. Since the hybrid is in between, it may not have either advantage.

Or maybe hybrids just aren’t very smart. “They could be sort of stupid and not react to the predator threat,” Nilsson says.

Picky mating

Just because scientists find hybrids doesn’t mean the two species will always breed with each other. Some animals are choosy about which mates they’ll accept from another species.

Marjorie Matocq studied this question in rodents called woodrats. Matocq is a biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. She started studying California’s woodrats in the 1990s. Matocq found these creatures interesting because they were very common, but scientists knew so little about them.

M. Matocq The desert woodrat (shown here) sometimes mates with a similar species called Bryant’s woodrat. Researchers have found that many hybrid offspring probably have a desert woodrat father and Bryant’s woodrat mother.

In a recent study, her team focused on two species: the desert woodrat and Bryant’s woodrat. Both live in the western United States. But desert woodrats are smaller and inhabit dry areas. The bigger Bryant’s woodrats live in shrubby and forested areas.

At a site in California, the two species overlapped. The animals here were mating and producing hybrids, but Matocq didn’t know how common this was. “Is it just a chance accident, or is this happening all the time?” she wondered.

To find out, the researchers brought woodrats to their lab. They set up tubes shaped like a T. In each experiment, the scientists placed a female desert woodrat or Bryant’s woodrat at the bottom of the T. Then they put a male desert woodrat and a male Bryant’s woodrat in opposite ends of the top of the T. The males were restrained with harnesses. The female could then visit either male and decide whether to mate.

Female desert woodrats almost always mated with their own species, the scientists found. These females may have avoided Bryant’s woodrats because those males were bigger and more aggressive. Indeed, the males often bit and scratched the females.

But the female Bryant’s woodrats didn’t mind mating with male desert woodrats. Those males were smaller and more docile. “There wasn’t as much danger,” Matocq observes.

The researchers suspect that many wild hybrids have a desert woodrat father and a Bryant’s woodrat mother. That could be important because mammals, such as woodrats, inherit bacteria from their mothers. These bacteria stay in the animal’s gut and are called their microbiome (My-kroh-BY-ohm).

An animal’s microbiome may affect its ability to digest food. Desert and Bryant’s woodrats likely eat different plants. Some of the plants are toxic. Each species may have evolved ways to safely digest what they chose to eat. And their microbiomes may have evolved to play a role in that as well.

If true, hybrids may have inherited bacteria that help them digest the plants that Bryant’s woodrats typically consume. That means these animals might be better-suited to dine on what a Bryant’s woodrat eats. Matocq’s team is now feeding different plants to the parent species and their hybrids. The researchers will monitor whether the animals get sick. Some hybrids might fare better or worse depending on their mix of DNA and gut bacteria.

What’s exciting about hybrids is that you can think of each one “as a little bit of an experiment,” Matocq says. “Some of them work, and some of them don’t.”",The mixed-up world of hybrid animals,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VuZXdzZm9yc3R1ZGVudHMub3JnL2FydGljbGUvbWl4ZWQtd29ybGQtaHlicmlkLWFuaW1hbHPSAU1odHRwczovL3d3dy5zY2llbmNlbmV3c2ZvcnN0dWRlbnRzLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlL21peGVkLXdvcmxkLWh5YnJpZC1hbmltYWxzL2FtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/860_hybrid_animals_liger.png,2018-09-13,"{'sent': 'Deep in the Amazon rainforest live two green birds.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Amazon']}}","Deep in the Amazon rainforest live two green birds.

Scientists are trying to understand how this process — called hybridization (HY-brih-dih-ZAY-shun) — plays out. Hybrid birds may take new migration routes, they found. Some hybrid fish appear more vulnerable to predators. And rodents’ mating habits may affect what their hybrid offspring can eat.

Maya Faccio; Fabio Olmos; Alfredo Barrera Two bird species, the snow-capped manakin (left) and opal-crowned manakin (right), mated to produce hybrids. The hybrids eventually became their own species, the golden-crowned manakin (center).

Wise to hybridize?

Hybridization happens for many reasons. For instance, the territory of two similar types of animals may overlap. This happens with polar and grizzly bears. Members of the two groups of animals have mated, producing hybrid bears.

When the climate changes, a species’ habitat can shift to a new area. These animals may encounter other, similar species. The two groups may mate by accident. For instance, researchers have found hybrids of southern flying squirrels and northern flying squirrels. As the climate warmed, the southern species moved north and mated with the other species.

When animals can’t find enough mates from their own species, they may select a mate from another species. “You have to make the best out of the situation,” says Kira Delmore. She is a biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology in Plön, Germany.

Scientists have seen this happen with two antelope species in southern Africa. Poachers had thinned out the populations of giant sable antelope and roan antelope. Later, the two species bred with each other.

People can unwittingly create opportunities for hybridization, too. They might put two closely related species in the same enclosure at a zoo. Or as cities expand, urban species may increasingly encounter rural ones. People may even set loose animals from other countries, accidentally or on purpose, into a new habitat. These exotic species now may encounter and mate with the native animals.

Many hybrid animals are sterile. That means they may be able to mate, but they won’t create offspring. For example, mules are the hybrid offspring of horses and donkeys. Most of these are sterile: Two mules can’t make more mules. Only a horse mating with a donkey can make another mule.

Biodiversity is a measure of the number of species. In the past, many scientists assumed that hybridization wasn’t good for biodiversity. If many hybrids were produced, the two parent species could merge into one. That would reduce the variety of species. That’s why “hybridization was often viewed as a bad thing,” Delmore explains.

But hybridization sometimes can boost biodiversity. A hybrid might be able to eat a certain food that its parent species cannot. Or maybe it can thrive in a different habitat. Eventually, it could become its own species, like the golden-crowned manakin. And that would increase — not decrease — the variety of life on Earth. Hybridization, Delmore concludes, is “actually a creative force.”

Going their own way

Hybrids can be different from their parents in many ways. Appearance is just one. Delmore wanted to know how hybrids might behave differently than their parents. She looked to a songbird called the Swainson’s thrush.

Over time, this species has split into subspecies. These are groups of animals from the same species that live in different areas. However, when they do encounter each other, they can still breed and produce fertile young.

One subspecies is the russet-backed thrush, which lives on the west coast of the United States and Canada. As its name implies, it has reddish feathers. The olive-backed thrush has greenish-brown feathers and lives farther inland. But these subspecies overlap along the Coast Mountains in western North America. There, they can mate and produce hybrids.

One difference between the two subspecies is their migration behavior. Both groups of birds breed in North America, then fly south in winter. But russet-backed thrushes migrate down the west coast to land in Mexico and Central America. Olive-backed thrushes fly over the central and eastern United States to settle in South America. Their routes are “super different,” Delmore says.

K. Delmore Scientists attached tiny backpacks (as seen on this bird) to hybrid songbirds called thrushes. The backpacks contained devices that helped the researchers track the birds’ migration routes.

The birds’ DNA contains instructions for where to fly. Which directions do hybrids get? To investigate, Delmore trapped hybrid birds in western Canada. She placed tiny backpacks on them. A light sensor in each backpack helped record where the birds went. The birds flew south to their wintering grounds, carrying the backpacks on their journey.

The next summer, Delmore re-captured some of those birds back in Canada. From the sensors’ light data, she figured out what time the sun had risen and set at each point along the bird’s journey. The length of the day and timing of midday differs depending on location. That helped Delmore deduce the birds’ migration paths.

Some hybrids roughly followed one of their parents’ routes. But others didn’t take either path. They flew somewhere down the middle. These treks, though, took the birds over rougher terrain, such as deserts and mountains. That could be a problem because those environments might offer less food to survive the long journey.

Another group of hybrids took the olive-backed thrush’s route south. Then they returned via the russet-backed thrush’s path. But that strategy might also cause problems. Normally, birds learn cues on their way south to help them navigate back home. They might notice landmarks such as mountains. But if they return by a different path, those landmarks will be absent. One result: The birds migration might take longer to complete.

These new data might explain why the subspecies have remained separate, Delmore says. Following a different path may mean that hybrid birds tend to be weaker when they reach the mating grounds — or have a lower chance of surviving their yearly journeys. If hybrids survived as well as their parents, DNA from the two subspecies would mix more often. Eventually these subspecies would fuse into one group. “Differences in migration could be helping these guys maintain differences,” Delmore concludes.

Perils of predators

Sometimes, hybrids are shaped differently than their parents. And that can affect how well they avoid predators.

Anders Nilsson recently stumbled onto this finding. He is a biologist at Lund University in Sweden. In 2005, his team was studying two fish species named common bream and roach (not to be confused with the insect). Both fish live in a lake in Denmark and migrate into streams during winter.

To study their behavior, Nilsson and his colleagues implanted tiny electronic tags in the fish. These tags allowed the scientists to track the fish’s movements. The team used a device that broadcast a radio signal. Tags that received the signal sent back one of their own that the team could detect.

At first, Nilsson’s team was interested only in roach and bream. But the researchers noticed other fish that looked like something in between. The main difference was their body shape. Viewed from the side, the bream appears diamond-shaped with a taller middle than its ends. The roach is more streamlined. It’s closer to a slim oval. The third fish’s shape was somewhere between those two.

Christian Skov Two fish species, the common bream (left) and roach (right), can mate to produce hybrids (center). The hybrid’s body shape is somewhere in between its parent species’ shapes.

“To the untrained eye, they just look like fish,” Nilsson admits. “But to a fish person, they are hugely different.”

Roach and bream must have mated to produce those in-between fish, the scientists thought. That would make those fish hybrids. And so the team began tagging those fish, too.

Fish-eating birds called great cormorants live in the same area as the fish. Other scientists were studying the cormorants’ predation of trout and salmon. Nilsson’s team wondered if the birds were eating roach, bream and hybrids as well.

Aron Hejdström Here’s a roost for birds called cormorants. Researchers found that these birds were more likely to eat hybrid fish than either species of the parent fish.

Cormorants gobble fish whole. Afterward, they spit out unwanted parts — including electronic tags. A few years after the researchers had tagged the fish, they visited the cormorants’ nesting and roosting sites. The birds’ homes were pretty gross. “They throw up and defecate all over the place,” Nilsson says. “It’s not pretty.”

But the researchers’ search was worth it. They found a lot of fish tags in the birds’ mess. And the hybrids appeared to fare the worst. For their efforts, the team found 9 percent of the bream tags and 14 percent of the roach tags. But 41 percent of the hybrids’ tags also turned up in the nests.

Nilsson isn’t sure why hybrids are more likely to be eaten. But perhaps their shape makes them easier targets. Its diamond-like shape makes bream hard to swallow. The roach’s streamlined body helps it quickly swim away from danger. Since the hybrid is in between, it may not have either advantage.

Or maybe hybrids just aren’t very smart. “They could be sort of stupid and not react to the predator threat,” Nilsson says.

Picky mating

Just because scientists find hybrids doesn’t mean the two species will always breed with each other. Some animals are choosy about which mates they’ll accept from another species.

Marjorie Matocq studied this question in rodents called woodrats. Matocq is a biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno. She started studying California’s woodrats in the 1990s. Matocq found these creatures interesting because they were very common, but scientists knew so little about them.

M. Matocq The desert woodrat (shown here) sometimes mates with a similar species called Bryant’s woodrat. Researchers have found that many hybrid offspring probably have a desert woodrat father and Bryant’s woodrat mother.

In a recent study, her team focused on two species: the desert woodrat and Bryant’s woodrat. Both live in the western United States. But desert woodrats are smaller and inhabit dry areas. The bigger Bryant’s woodrats live in shrubby and forested areas.

At a site in California, the two species overlapped. The animals here were mating and producing hybrids, but Matocq didn’t know how common this was. “Is it just a chance accident, or is this happening all the time?” she wondered.

To find out, the researchers brought woodrats to their lab. They set up tubes shaped like a T. In each experiment, the scientists placed a female desert woodrat or Bryant’s woodrat at the bottom of the T. Then they put a male desert woodrat and a male Bryant’s woodrat in opposite ends of the top of the T. The males were restrained with harnesses. The female could then visit either male and decide whether to mate.

Female desert woodrats almost always mated with their own species, the scientists found. These females may have avoided Bryant’s woodrats because those males were bigger and more aggressive. Indeed, the males often bit and scratched the females.

But the female Bryant’s woodrats didn’t mind mating with male desert woodrats. Those males were smaller and more docile. “There wasn’t as much danger,” Matocq observes.

The researchers suspect that many wild hybrids have a desert woodrat father and a Bryant’s woodrat mother. That could be important because mammals, such as woodrats, inherit bacteria from their mothers. These bacteria stay in the animal’s gut and are called their microbiome (My-kroh-BY-ohm).

An animal’s microbiome may affect its ability to digest food. Desert and Bryant’s woodrats likely eat different plants. Some of the plants are toxic. Each species may have evolved ways to safely digest what they chose to eat. And their microbiomes may have evolved to play a role in that as well.

If true, hybrids may have inherited bacteria that help them digest the plants that Bryant’s woodrats typically consume. That means these animals might be better-suited to dine on what a Bryant’s woodrat eats. Matocq’s team is now feeding different plants to the parent species and their hybrids. The researchers will monitor whether the animals get sick. Some hybrids might fare better or worse depending on their mix of DNA and gut bacteria.

What’s exciting about hybrids is that you can think of each one “as a little bit of an experiment,” Matocq says. “Some of them work, and some of them don’t.”","[{'ORG', 'Amazon'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'PERSON', 'Alfredo Barrera-Guzmán'}, {'the Autonomous University of Yucatán', 'ORG'}, {'Mérida', 'GPE'}, {'Mexico', 'GPE'}, {'Toronto Scarborough Feathers', 'GPE'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'Thousands of years ago', 'DATE'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'Barrera-Guzmán', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'ORG', 'Amazon'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'HY', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Maya Faccio'}, {'PERSON', 'Fabio Olmos'}, {'PERSON', 'Alfredo Barrera'}, {'CARDINAL', 'Two'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'PERSON', 'Kira Delmore'}, {'the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology', 'ORG'}, {'Plön', 'GPE'}, {'Germany', 'GPE'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'Africa', 'LOC'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'CARDINAL', 'Two'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'Earth', 'LOC'}, {'Hybridization, Delmore', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Swainson'}, {'CARDINAL', 'One'}, {'the west coast', 'LOC'}, {'the United States', 'GPE'}, {'Canada', 'GPE'}, {'the Coast Mountains', 'LOC'}, {'North America', 'LOC'}, {'CARDINAL', 'One'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'North America', 'LOC'}, {'DATE', 'winter'}, {'the west coast', 'LOC'}, {'Mexico', 'GPE'}, {'Central America', 'LOC'}, {'eastern United States', 'GPE'}, {'South America', 'LOC'}, {'Canada', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'The next summer'}, {'Canada', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'the day'}, {'TIME', 'midday'}, {'PERSON', 'Delmore'}, {'CARDINAL', 'One'}, {'PERSON', 'Delmore'}, {'DATE', 'yearly'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'Lund University', 'ORG'}, {'Sweden', 'GPE'}, {'2005', 'DATE'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'Denmark', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'winter'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'ORDINAL', 'third'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'Christian Skov', 'PERSON'}, {'CARDINAL', 'Two'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'PERSON', 'Roach'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'DATE', 'A few years'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'9 percent', 'PERCENT'}, {'14 percent', 'PERCENT'}, {'PERCENT', '41 percent'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'ORG', 'Nilsson'}, {'PERSON', 'Picky'}, {'CARDINAL', 'two'}, {'Marjorie Matocq', 'PERSON'}, {'Matocq', 'GPE'}, {'the University of Nevada', 'ORG'}, {'Reno', 'GPE'}, {'California', 'GPE'}, {'the 1990s', 'DATE'}, {'Matocq', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'M.

0,"For the past seven months on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, inside a building that was once heated by coal, teams of conservation scientists and museum designers in hazmat suits have scrubbed wax-pressed leaves with acetone, airbrushed animal fur, and re-staged lighting in two large dioramas.

They're working on two scenes of the natural world first built in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University back in 1933 to show visitors far-away places they would never get to see in their lifetimes.

So for 80 years behind glass, three taxidermic gorillas in the African jungle and a small group of stuffed elegant Chinese takin sat and watched history go by.

After teams of historians, scientists, taxidermists, designers and artists completed the comprehensive restoration, the glass fronts on the two dioramas were re-sealed on Thursday and the scenes were permanently put on pause for the museum's visitors to see yet again.

Jennifer Sontchi, the academy's senior director of exhibits and public spaces, recruited expert and longtime taxidermist George Dante — who started his New Jersey-based business called Wildlife Preservation when he was still in high school — for the enormous project.

Because the dioramas hadn’t gotten a deep clean, well, ever.

The canvas-painted backdrops were scrubbed; the taxidermic animals were handed over to Dante; potato-chip thin leaves were gently rubbed with Q-tips to remove old dust and soot created by the building's former coal-fired heating system; and the flora and fauna were scrutinized by conservationists, all in a matter of months.

Cleaning processes needed to be repeated sometimes four, five times — “It would come off black, just black,"" Sontchi said of the layers of grime that were removed.

The teams ultimately also found errors how the original dioramas were staged, like the wrong kind of leaves were in Africa, misplaced orchids were in Asia, the wrong kind of butterfly lived in the jungle. (If you can spot an error in the dioramas now, Sontchi said, hats off.)

Updating the interior and dusting off the props were part of the museum's larger goal to bring them back to life, so to speak. When museums first opened to the public in the 1930s, these dioramas were about conservation, preservation, and to show the public that yes, gorillas actually do exist somewhere in the great wide beyond — even though most people would never get to see one live in its natural habitat.

""At that time, [scientists] didn't think these areas were going to last,"" Dante said. ""They saw the writing on the wall that our natural world was being lost at a rapid rate so they figured these dioramas were the last record of that and to bring awareness to protect the natural wildlife.""

""But that story completely changed,"" Sontchi said. ""You can go on YouTube and see a gorilla right now.""

Now, museum staff like to think dioramas are pieces of history, paused in time. They capture something distinct that you can't even see in a zoo, or sometimes even in the animals' native habitats today — a species thriving in its intended environment; a codependent, thriving ecosystem. Contributed image/The Academy of Natural Sciences, John Hutelmyer Contributed image/The Academy of Natural Sciences, John Hutelmyer Taxidermist George Dante of Wildlife Preservations works in his Woodland Park, N.J. studio.

""They've become these time capsules and historic records and now they're amazing pieces of artwork,"" Dante said.

Each adhesive, paint, and dye had to be carefully selected so that years from now not just the skin and fur would keep a pulse, but that the shine on flowers and vibrancy of every butterfly wing would last, too.

“We knew we were making decisions that were bigger than us,” Sontchi said.

""We want to make sure these dioramas will be here for another 100 years, for our grandchildren's grandchildren,"" Dante added.

Taxidermists first evaluated cracks in the skin, splits, fading, and shrinking on the gorilla and Chinese takin. But they mostly were just dirty, with a few cracks here and there. And the takin especially needed a paint job.

Sontchi said when the antelope-like animals left, they were gray. But Dante and his team hand-mixed and experimented with different fur shades, eventually airbrushing five blended colors onto the furs to restore them to their original buttery gold.

In the taxidermy world, there are some little-known secrets Dante clued me in on. For starters, the reason the gorilla and takin have been so well preserved, after all these years?

Arsenic.

That's still the only way taxidermy can be completely preserved from pests, he said, which means the industry has suffered since we've discovered the dangers of arsenic. Cloth moths and beetles are no match for the chemical because it migrates into the animal hair and kills bugs when they try to munch. Today, there's no safe, effective pesticide they can use to keep them out.

Another industry secret? When cleaning some of the plants in each diorama, staff use artificial saliva (yep, they make that) to get soot off the tissue-paper-thin leaves and flowers without stripping away color.

Photo courtesy/The Academy of Natural Sciences, John Hutelmyer Every leaf in each diorama was cleaned by hand.

""It’s pretty hard to get enough saliva from your co-workers to clean a diorama … but you can buy artificial saliva to take the pressure off,” Sontchi said, laughing.

Leaf litter on the ecosystem floor that were like crushed, mealy, brown leftovers — like the path of leaves in the fall leading up to your front door — was replaced with leaves from local arboretums that fostered African trees.

“Because we don’t want someone saying, ‘What's an oak doing in here?’"" Sontchi said.

The museum's exhibition designer, Lauren Duguid, an artist, former body piercer, tattooer, and professor at the University of the Arts in Philly said at the diorama re-sealing on Thursday that these holes in the wall were essentially her home for four months while she dusted, shined, and glued in two layers of gloves, a breathing mask, and a splash suit that kept all of the dust and heavy-metal toxins out, and her body heat in.



Pretty much anything that looks alive is dead in there and needed to be cleaned with a dexterous hand. Most of the wax plants had the sturdiness of ""a drip of wax on a candle,"" Duguid said. And she cleaned them while being double gloved and sweating.

Thom Carroll/PhillyVoice Lauren Duguid, exhibitions designer at the Academy of Natural Sciences.

But she's already got her eye on another project: The giant sable antelope, which features termite mounds, little colorful shrubs, a long-tailed bird and a few rare flowers.

Restoring these two ecosystems was really just phase one. Now, the teams will take on labeling each diorama, but not basic descriptions of the huge animals like there were before. This time, the Academy of Natural Sciences wants to describe each ecosystem and how every snail, piece of grass, and bird is dependent on the other.

And for the first time in the museum's history, there will be some digital components for the viewer experience, like videos and interactive games.

""We’ve decided to broaden the story,"" Sontchi said. ""These dioramas tell very rich, very deep stories but our dioramas don’t carry that. We’re reframing them as ecosystems, instead of just the animals. It’s important for people to take away from the museum that every animal is part of a system.”

The glass, which weighs about 330 pounds, was hoisted back into place on Thursday in front of some of the staff, a boisterous crowd that burst into applause when the gorillas were safely back behind the same glass used to seal them during the Great Depression.

Compared to the gorilla and takin displays, the other dioramas look dull now, as if they're all a bit more dead than they already are. The new ones, though, are eerily real.

But that's the whole point, right? If the fragility of these ecosystems seems real, maybe it will make some sort of impact and leave the museum's visitors with a lasting lesson that's more than just a few facts on a plaque. Or that's their hope.

“Get engaged, get some agency for your own world, your natural world, and jump on in,"" Sontchi said. ""That’s really what we’re hoping we achieve with our artificial saliva.""

Compared to the gorilla and takin displays, the other dioramas look dull now, as if they're all a bit more dead than they already are. The new ones, though, are eerily real.

But that's the whole point, right? If the fragility of these ecosystems seems real, maybe it will make some sort of impact and leave the museum's visitors with a lasting lesson that's more than just a few facts on a plaque. Or that's their hope.

“Get engaged, get some agency for your own world, your natural world, and jump on in,"" Sontchi said. ""That’s really what we’re hoping we achieve with our artificial saliva.""

0,"Early one summer morning, as rain is misting the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, a middle-aged man is courting a crane. Chris Crowe, 42, bends forward in a slight bow and then ﬂaps his arms slowly, like wings. ""Hey, girl, whatcha think,"" he coos.

Walnut has heard that line before. The stately bird ignores Crowe, reshuffles her storm cloud–gray wings, and snakes her head gracefully to the ground, looking for something tasty to eat.

""Come on, now,"" Crowe says. The zookeeper grabs a fistful of grass and tosses it into the air. This is Crowe's sexiest move — a sly reference to building a nest together. Walnut looks up, curiosity glinting in her marigold eyes, but then she returns to probing the soft, wet ground with her bark-colored bill.

""Try getting in the van,"" Crowe calls to me. I follow his suggestion, and almost immediately, Walnut starts responding to Crowe's overtures. She returns his bows and then turns away from him and holds her wings loosely away from her body. Kneeling behind the bird, Crowe rests a hand gently on her back. Then he starts rubbing her thighs, rhythmically, almost pornographically. Thirty seconds elapse before Walnut steps away from Crowe, fixes a few out-of-place feathers, and then stretches out her wings, asking for another go-round.

In past years, Crowe would have taken this opportunity to inject Walnut with a syringe of crane semen. Alas, a matchmaker in Memphis — the keeper of the white-naped crane studbook, whose job is to ensure a genetically diverse captive population — has decreed that they don't need any more babies from Walnut, at least not this year. But that doesn't stop Crowe and Walnut from going through the motions all summer long, five days a week, sometimes several times a day. ""It's not exactly fun for me, but it keeps Walnut happy,"" Crowe says.

More to the point, this strange cross-species seduction has helped ensure that white-naped cranes continue to exist.

Walnut arrived at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI), an endangered-species breeding center in Front Royal, Virginia, back in 2004. She was the most genetically valuable white-naped crane in captivity. At 23, she had yet to produce a single chick, and she had a reputation for murdering her mates. Two male cranes that made amorous overtures toward Walnut had been found dead, with their bellies sliced open by her sharp claws. That, at least, was the rumor.

Walnut hatched on July 2, 1981, in an old horse barn at the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in Baraboo, Wisconsin. Her parents, Mercury and Amazon, were wild-caught birds. Captured illegally in China and smuggled to Hong Kong, the two cranes were probably en route to a private menagerie, or perhaps a taxidermist. Instead, they were intercepted by local authorities and eventually shipped to the ICF.

This kind of poaching is less common today, but the white-naped crane population is falling because of a more relentless foe: booming human populations overtaking, polluting, or draining the wetlands the birds need to survive. In addition to demanding as much as several hundred acres of wilderness for a single pair of cranes, these difficult birds seem drawn to marginal places. For instance, one of the white-naped cranes' most important wintering grounds is the 2.5-mile-wide demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.

As conservationists work to persuade people to preserve land for cranes, zoos are pursuing a parallel strategy. They are breeding captive white-naped cranes, creating an ""insurance population"" ready to be reintroduced should their wild counterparts disappear. But the problem with captive populations of animals is that they tend to get inbred, which is why — in 1981 — keepers were thrilled to have the genes of Mercury and Amazon to add to the mix.

The two wowed ICF staff with their exuberant courtship displays — running, bowing, leaping, and trumpeting their love for each other all summer long. That year, they produced nine chicks, including Walnut.

These wobbly baby birds were raised in small herds, minded by so-called chick mamas who fed them, cleaned their pens, and took them out to a horse ring for daily exercise and to a baby pool for swimming lessons. The chick mamas were mostly volunteers, says Joan Fordham, a former ICF employee. Fordham's 10-year-old daughter was a chick mama one summer, and she apparently didn't get a lot of training. ""If the cranes started fighting, she knew how to separate them, and that was pretty much it,"" Fordham recalls.

The danger of hand-rearing crane chicks, however, is the possibility that they may ""imprint"" on humans. When it's time to find a suitable mate, some human-imprinted cranes seek out a partner that looks like their presumed parent — a human, instead of another bird. This, it seems, is what happened with Walnut.

Bridging a 320 million–year evolutionary divide, Walnut likely made some human fall in love with her. This relationship, however well-meaning, doomed Walnut to a life of loneliness. Cranes, which mate for life, are happiest when housed in pairs. Walnut was transferred to the Denver Zoo and then the Cincinnati Zoo, but keepers were never able to find her a mate.

In October 2004, Walnut was transferred to SCBI for one last chance at motherhood.

The Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute sprawls across 3,200 acres of rolling hills near Shenandoah National Park. There, far from the noisy crowds that pour through its sister institution, the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., members of 21 threatened or endangered species are busy having babies, making their kinds a little less rare.

As winter shaded into spring, Carol Hesch, assistant curator at the Memphis Zoo and keeper of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' white-naped crane studbook, consulted a genetic database and determined that Walnut should be bred with Ray, a comely male crane two yards over.

Ray, however, was already paired with Abigail; if they tried to put Walnut and Ray together, feathers would fly, so to speak. So, the plan was to use artificial insemination, a stressful procedure that requires capturing the birds and holding them down for minutes at a time.

One day that March, Crowe and Warren Lynch, a fellow zookeeper at SCBI, entered Walnut's cage and herded her into a corner. The moment Walnut looked away, Lynch grabbed her body underneath her wings. Then, he stepped over the bird and held her between his legs, facing backward. Kneeling behind her, Crowe began massaging Walnut's cloaca — an all-purpose orifice that birds use for defecation as well as reproduction — and applied gentle pressure to her back, mimicking the weight of a male crane. Walnut purred, her cloaca opened, and Crowe injected semen that the two zookeepers had collected, in much the same way, from Ray.

A few weeks later, Walnut laid two fertilized eggs, which Crowe stole and placed in Ray and Abigail's nest. That was necessary because, in the wild, cranes take turns incubating their eggs, and Crowe didn't want Walnut to shoulder that burden alone. ""It's just too much for her,"" he says, ""and I don't want to sit on it myself.""

Plus, it was becoming clear to Crowe that Walnut did not see herself as a crane and might not recognize baby cranes as her own. In fact, one young male crane with a clear view of Walnut was always trying to get her attention, with head bobs and calls. Walnut wasn't having any of it.

That summer, however, Crowe noticed that Walnut seemed interested in, well, him. When Crowe stopped by her yard, she would bow her head and raise her wings — motions that Crowe now recognizes as the first moves of a mating dance. ""At first, I thought that she was just excited to see me,"" Crowe says. ""But then I'd see the other pairs doing the same things, and it kind of dawned on me.""

Crowe accepted Walnut's invitation to dance. Though he felt a little silly, he bobbed his head when Walnut bobbed hers, and raised and lowered his arms like wings. The two circled each other, and sometimes Walnut would make a loud, trumpeting call — the beginning of the white-naped crane love duet. If no one was around, Crowe would try to do the male part of the song — making a Homer Simpson–like ""woo-hoo"" — but Walnut never found his efforts satisfactory.

As the weather cooled, so did Walnut's ardor. But in the spring, Walnut began greeting her keeper with bows again. This gave Crowe an idea: If Walnut thought he was her mate, maybe Crowe could make that year's artificial insemination less stressful for both of them. ""If we could get her able to do it without catching her, there's no stress, no risk of injury,"" Crowe says. ""It's much better for us and for the crane.""

So Crowe started training her to tolerate his touch. Reaching his arm out slowly, he'd graze Walnut's tail feathers with his fingertips and then immediately reward her with a dead mouse, Walnut's favorite treat. Eventually, Walnut allowed Crowe to pet her entire back, and she seemed to enjoy it, purring like a contented cat.

One day, after some back petting, Walnut turned away from Crowe, extended her wings, and raised her tail — an invitation to mate. Walnut was asking Crowe to flutter to her back and perform what's poetically known as a ""cloacal kiss."" Crowe recalls being both startled and amused. ""It's what I had been working toward and hoping for, but it was still surprising when it happened,"" he says. Composing himself, Crowe put a hand on Walnut's back and then rubbed her thighs, going through the motions of artificial insemination.

Once the two got their routine down, in March 2007, Crowe and Lynch captured Ray and collected semen, and then Crowe injected it into Walnut by himself, with her willing participation. Walnut and Crowe would go on to produce five chicks this way — a major boon for the captive white-naped crane population, Lynch says. That also means Walnut's rare genes are no longer in danger of dying with her.

Crowe is proud of his groundbreaking work with cranes, but he admits that sometimes the whole project feels futile. White-naped cranes are continuing to decline in the wild, and many other species appear headed toward extinction. The heart of the matter, it seems, is that most people don't share Crowe's conviction that animals are thinking, feeling individuals. That they have just as legitimate a claim on this planet as we humans do.

How do we bridge the ever-widening gap that separates us from the environment, other animals, and even one another? Maybe, Crowe and Walnut are demonstrating — and my apologies to the Beatles — that all you need is love. After all, what ultimately drives even the most scientific, tough-minded conservation efforts is an irrational, bighearted embrace of a wilderness that's coldly indifferent to us, an impossible connection we feel to animals that we can never truly understand. All this time, we heavy-headed primates assumed our brains held all the solutions, but maybe our hearts can be a better guide.

The birth is the result of a rescue plan by biologists at the National Autonomous University (UNAM) in a jungle area of the state’s Tuxtlas region.

Experts from Nanciyaga Ecological Reserve, the Ancient Forest Association and the Xcaret Ecological Park also participated in the project.

Patricia Escalante, a researcher at the UNAM Institute of Biology, said the birth of a chick offers hope both for the success of the rescue plan and the conservation of the species in Mexico.

She added that there was no point releasing the macaws in the area if they didn’t reproduce, stating that “sooner or later” they would disappear again.

Before the conservation project began four years ago, the last time a scarlet macaw was seen in rainforest in the Tuxtlas region was in the 1970s, according to a report published by the university’s news portal UNAM Global.

To encourage the released birds to breed, the project team placed wooden nesting boxes in trees in four release locations that were later checked each month to see if they were being used.

The breeding season of the scarlet macaw, or guacamaya as the bird is known in Spanish, began in March but for three months there was no sign that they had used the boxes for the purpose for which they were intended: to lay eggs.

“We thought there would be no chicks because a lot of time had passed and we hadn’t found anything,” said Omar Gómez, an UNAM student who was responsible for checking the nests.

But in June, five eggs were discovered in a single nest and through observation, the researchers discovered that three macaws were looking after it.

“Two females laid eggs accompanied by the same male,” Escalante explained. But unfortunately, only one chick survived.

A camera was installed in the nest that allows the biologists to monitor the chick and all appears to be going well.

“We’ve left them to raise it on their own, we haven’t intervened and they have protected the chick from possible predators,” Escalante said.

She added that by leaving the chick to be raised without human contact a new generation of completely wild scarlet macaws could begin to inhabit the region.

The species is considered endangered in Mexico, with only about 250 birds estimated to be living in the wild.

The largest population of red macaws in the country live in the Lacandon jungle in Chiapas.

The operation took place in conjunction with the officers of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence in Aizawl, Guwahati and Kolkata.

news Wildlife

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Chennai, has busted an international syndicate of exotic wildlife smugglers and seized around 100 different species of foreign birds and animals. According to a statement released by the Department on Monday, the officers of the DRI conducted a coordinated swoop on the syndicate that was involved in smuggling exotic wildlife species of birds and animals.

The DRI officials conducted searches at two locations in Chennai - one at a residential property in the city and the other at a farmhouse on the outskirts. The searches resulted in the seizure of 70 species of wildlife comprising birds such as Scarlet Macaw, Harlequin Macaw, Blue Gold Macaw, varieties of Conure and Cockatoos. The swoop also led to the seizure of wildlife animals such as Squirrel Monkey, Callithrix Monkey and a pair of Red Iguana.

One key member of the syndicate has been apprehended by the DRI. The operation took place in conjunction with the officers of the DRI in Aizawl, Guwahati and Kolkata.

According to the intelligence agency, officers of DRI at Aizawl and Kolkata intercepted a consignment of assorted wildlife of foreign origin consisting of 35 birds of various species. This included a baby marmoset and one Bengal cat that was discovered at the Kolkata airport. The DRI states that these were smuggled through the porous Indo-Myanmar border.

The Aizawl, Mizoram DRI nabbed the mastermind who organised the illicit cross-border transportation of this exotic wildlife. The accused then confessed to his role in the smuggling. He has also named the persons for whom he was organising the smuggling activity. They were based out of Mumbai, Pune and Chennai.

The DRI states that further investigation is underway.

According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the import, export and re-export of any live animal or plant of a species listed in the CITES Appendices (or of any part or derivative of such animal or plant) require a permit or certificate.

International trade in all wild fauna and flora in general, and the species covered under CITES in particular, are regulated jointly through the provisions of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, the Foreign Trade (Development Regulation) Act, 1992, and the Foreign Trade Policy of Government of India and Customs Act, 1962.

Per Customs Act, 1962, the offences are punishable with imprisonment for a term that may extend to seven years and with fine.

Ecuador’s León River is ‘condor central’

No matter how high or how far Ecuador’s condors soar, they always return home to a semi-desert, lowland ecosystem around the León River. A Wildlife Conservation Study warns that if changes to the condors’ habitat happen twice as fast as now, they will go extinct in 60 years. A 2015 census put the condor population at between 94 and 102 individuals.

Pablo Escobar’s growing hippo legacy

Rapidly reproducing hippos may be the most enduring legacy the most famous narcotrafficker of all, Pablo Escobar, left to Colombia. While a juvenile hippo was recently transported to a zoo near Bogotá, some 50 to 70 hippos from Escobar’s former personal zoo continue to wander freely without predators or state control in the streams and lakes near the Madgalena River to the west.

Threats and promises in Central America’s last Scarlet Macaw corridor

Habitat loss; theft of eggs and chicks; local suppliers, high-level clients, and village guardians — all are key factors in the survival of the last scarlet macaw corridor in Central America. Once spanning Belize, Guatemala and Mexico, the birds (Ara macao) now find refuge in only three protected areas. Locals robbing nests of eggs and chicks for traffickers are the biggest threat to their survival. Conservation projects that give the people incentives to protect the nests have the potential to restore sustainable scarlet macaw populations within 10 years, though.

Bolivia ranks fourth in October Big Day

Bolivia ranked fourth in bird species spotted in the first annual October Global Big Day. The competition to count species of birds in a single day is normally held in May, the best time for bird watching in the northern hemisphere, but tropical countries requested an additional day in their best season. This month Bolivia listed a total of 854 species observed in a single day, ranking it fourth after Colombia, Brazil and Peru.

Black market fishing for hake out of control in Chile

In Chile’s debate about who is responsible for endangering hake populations, everyone points to poor governance for encouraging the black market. It is estimated that illegal hake fishing reaps up to $300 million a year. While a box of about 100 fish costs $60, the same box of illegally caught hake goes for $23 on the black market. More than 139 tons of hake, a staple of the country’s favorite traditional fish dish, were harvested in 2003; today the quota is set at 25,000 tons.

“Aves Memento Mori: Exploring the Anthropogenic Effects on Bird Species” is the work of senior biomedical art and illustration major Christina Czajkowski. Currently on display in the Westby Student Gallery, the title translates from Latin to “remember the birds.” According to Czajkowski’s description of the exhibit, the human impact on avian survival was a key theme among her works.

“Bird species have been declining at an alarming rate due to anthropogenic activity,” Czajkowski said. “Currently one in eight bird species faces extinction while over 100 are already gone due to anthropogenic activity. My goal is to communicate to the viewer the staggering loss of life these past and future extinctions involve, along with showing the current effect of anthropogenic activity on extant species and in turn the overarching effect of declining bird species on ecological health. An attempt at connecting the viewer to extinct and extant species will be made by positioning these birds in compositions that are reminiscent of religious iconography, and have relation to prominent religious artwork from various periods of art history.”

According to Scientific American, the top ten most endangered bird species are the giant ibis, the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar, the California condor, the kakapo, the kagu, the Bengal florican, the forest owlet, the Philippine eagle, the Christmas Island frigatebird and the Sumatran ground-cuckoo.

“Aves Memento Mori: Exploring the Anthropogenic Effects on Bird Species” is the work of senior biomedical art and illustration major Christina Czajkowski. Currently on display in the Westby Student Gallery, the title translates from Latin to “remember the birds.” According to Czajkowski’s description of the exhibit, the human impact on avian survival was a key theme among her works.

0,"As a news report shows an upward trend for migratory waterbirds in Africa, Europe and Asia, wildlife and conservation experts in the Philippines believe the campaign to protect and conserve these threatened species are finally paying off.

They believe the country’s efforts provided the much-needed boost in the regional and global effort to protect and conserve migratory birds as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) shares the results of the Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) 2018.

It included sightings of new recordings and potentially new species of migratory birds, underscoring the need to further strengthen the protection of these long-distance flyers and their temporary habitats in various parts of the country, as well as its neighbors in Southeast Asia.

The Philippines belongs to the East Asia-Australasia Flyway, one of nine major routes of migratory birds recognized globally, and takes part in the annual bird count being spearheaded by the DENR.

The AWC forms part of the International Waterbird Census (IWC), which records the global population of migratory birds.

Upward trend

The overall status of waterbird populations listed on the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement has slightly improved over the last 10 years, according to the seventh edition of the AEWA Conservation Status Review of Migratory Waterbirds in the Agreement Area, which provides a long-term view of the changing status of migratory waterbird populations listed under AEWA.

The finding was released ahead of the celebration of World Migratory Bird Day on October 13. The World Migratory Bird Day is celebrated every second Saturday of May and October.

An annual UN-backed global awareness-raising and environmental education campaign, the World Migratory Bird Day is focused in the need for international cooperation to conserve migratory birds.

“The upward trend assessed in the report is due to concerted conservation actions along the birds’ migration routes, the so-called flyways. These ranges from targeted species action plan for the most threatened species to ensure that hunting of widespread waterbird species is sustainable,” a statement posted in the World Migratory Bird Day 2018 web site.

“More than 60 percent of populations of the species covered by AEWA are stable or increasing. Pelicans, cormorants, avocets and stilts, flamingos and storks are the waterbird families with the highest proportion of increasing populations. However, crane and auk numbers are in strong decline. And the highest proportion of populations on the Endangered International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List are in Eastern and Southern Africa,” the report added.

However, while AEWA is successful with the recovery of threatened species, the report noted that the challenge is for the treaty to stop the decline among the more common waterbirds as they are facing habitat degradation or reduction in at least some parts of their ranges.

A global trend?

The report is a positive indication and may well reflect a global trend, including that in the East Asia-Australasia Flyway of which the Philippines is part and a contracting party, Anson Tagtag, chief of the DENR-BMB’s Wildlife Management Section told the BusinessMirror. Tagtag is the country’s coordinator for the IWC and AWC.

The East Asia/Australasia Flyway extends from Arctic Russia and North America to the southern limits of Australia and New Zealand. It encompasses large parts of East Asia, all of Southeast Asia and includes eastern India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Over 50 million migratory waterbirds, including 8 million waders, are using the route annually.

Increased sightings

There is an increased sighting of migratory birds in the Philippines in the last four years from 2014 to 2017.

From a high of 405,800 birds recorded in 2013, only 287,807 birds were recorded in 2014; 301,641 in 2015; 239,923 in 2016; and 320,164 in 2017.

Slightly fewer birds were recorded during the bird count held in January and February this year as part of the Asian Waterbird Census 2018.

Based on the data provided by the DENR-BMB, a total of 302,254 birds were counted in 269 sites covered by the simultaneous activity this year. This is slightly lower than the 320,164 birds recorded in 2017.

However, more bird species were recorded this year which were not readily identified by census participants, including 50 cormorants; 16,592 bitterns, herons and egrets; four unidentified storks; 110 unidentified ducks; 4,040 unidentified shorebirds; 40 unidentified gulls; 5,080 unidentified terms.

Some of these are potentially new recordings or possibly new species of birds in the migratory bird sites being monitored by the DENR and its partners.

At the Naujan Lake, a Ramsar Site, for instance, the result of the bird count on January 18 showed 5,523 birds which were fewer than the 6,907 counted last year. However, potentially two new species—garganeys and Eurasian wigeons—were spotted among the ducks visiting the lake during migration season.

The Mindoro Biodiversity Conservation Foundation Inc. also reported in June of a rare sighting of a Christmas frigatebird, a globally threatened species, while conducting a study at the Apo Reef Natural Park.

Central Luzon recorded the most number of birds with 67,549 in Pampanga province, making it the province with the most number of birds counted.

Meanwhile, the Olango Island Wildlife Sanctuary in Cebu in Central Visayas topped the individual site with the most number of migratory birds recorded, with a total of 20,086 birds in January.

Heron and egrets; geese and ducks; rails, gallinules and coots, were among the 98 species identified during the count, with little egret topping the most number of birds counted per species.

Migratory birds help keep an ecosystem healthy. As they feed, these biological agents control the population of potentially harmful insects, leave feces that fertilize the soil, help make water bodies healthy for fish to thrive, drop countless seeds of the fruits they eat that naturally regenerating degraded forests.

But over the years, the population of migratory birds continues to decline owing to numerous factors—including habitat loss, hunting for food, illegal wildlife trade or for games trophy, which is aggravated by biodiversity loss caused by drastic changes in climatic conditions.

Safe haven

The country’s strategic location provides migratory birds more than a temporary refuge during the migration season as these birds, considered as ecosystems indicator, escape the colder regions.

The DENR maintains a safe haven for these birds.

According to BirdLife International, the Philippines has 117 important bird areas covering 32,302 square kilometers that act as a refuge for as many as 115 globally threatened species of water birds.

The Philippines has seven Ramsar Sites or Wetlands of International Importance, with a combined surface area of 244,017 hectares.

Besides the Naujan Lake National Park, the other Ramsar Sites are the Agusan Marsh Wildlife Sanctuary, Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area, Negros Occidental Coastal Wetlands Conservation Area, Olango Island Wildlife Sanctuary, Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park and Tubbataha Reefs Natural Park. As protected areas, these sites are declared as areas set aside for conservation.

Interviewed by the BusinessMirror via phone last month, Tagtag said any upward trend in the annual bird count does not mean there is already an increasing population.

However, such “trend” is a good sign because it means the effort to monitor the annual migration is gaining support with environmentalists, conservation advocates, bird-watchers and hobbyists helping out to do the count, hence covering more areas.

Increased number of birds or species recorded during the bird count may also be a positive sign or an indication that the conservation effort is also paying off noting that migratory birds are considered as an indicator of the health of an ecosystem.

In such case, he said it means the DENR’s communication, education and public-awareness campaign with the help of other national government agencies, including the local government units (LGUs) hosting these migratory bird sites are gaining traction.

“This can also mean that the sites are now well protected because of increased awareness of their importance, such as for ecotourism. Some LGUs have shown interest in protecting these migratory bird sites because of potential ecotourism revenues,” he said in mixed English and Filipino.

Regional connectivity

For her part, Theresa Mundita S. Lim, executive director of the Asean Centre for Biodiversity, underscored the importance of protecting the network of protected areas that support the survival of migratory birds, such as in the East Asia/Australasia Flyway.

“Increased sighting doesn’t necessarily translate to increase in the population of the birds. It could also mean increased effort in migratory bird monitoring in the range countries. It is nevertheless still a good indication of the increasing awareness of communities, for more people are now taking part in the annual bird count and monitoring,” she said.

According to Lim, a former chief of the DENR-BMB, effective management of protected areas or national parks in Southeast Asia that are wintering areas of migratory bird species in the region—such as the Ba Be National Park in Vietnam, the Tubbataha Reefs in the Philippines, the Sungei Buloh wetland reserve in Singapore—is vital in keeping the population of migratory birds healthy.

“In planning for infrastructure for various development projects in the region, it is important to take these areas into account, as the decline of migratory species is also an indicator of deteriorating ecosystems that serve as natural adaptation measures against climate change and for providing food security,” she said.

“Protecting these important feeding and watering areas for migratory species from human encroachment and unsustainable agricultural practices also help control the emergence of diseases by minimizing contact and exposure among humans, domestic and wild birds to mutating viruses and other disease-causing agents,” she stressed.

Whether there is an increase in the population of these waterbirds, an upward trend or even increased sighting of newly recorded or new species of migratory birds, including those that are already globally endangered are a welcome development and gives conservation advocates renewed hope for these globally threatened migratory birds.",High hopes for migratory waterbirds,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYnVzaW5lc3NtaXJyb3IuY29tLnBoLzIwMTgvMTEvMTIvaGlnaC1ob3Blcy1mb3ItbWlncmF0b3J5LXdhdGVyYmlyZHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://businessmirror.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bio02-111218.jpg,2018-11-12,"{'sent': 'As a news report shows an upward trend for migratory waterbirds in Africa, Europe and Asia, wildlife and conservation experts in the Philippines believe the campaign to protect and conserve these threatened species are finally paying off.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Philippines']}}","As a news report shows an upward trend for migratory waterbirds in Africa, Europe and Asia, wildlife and conservation experts in the Philippines believe the campaign to protect and conserve these threatened species are finally paying off.

Antelopes are many different species of ungulate that can be found in parts of Eurasia and Africa. African antelopes can be found almost all throughout the African continent. Though some people think of a singular animal when they hear the term antelope, antelope refers to many different species be found in different regions around the world.

The term is actually used to describe members of the bovidae family that aren’t goats, sheep, or cattle. There are currently around 90 different recognized species of antelopes, most of which are native to Africa. Let’s examine some of the most interesting types of antelopes found in Africa.

Eland

The eland is a notable amongst African antelopes for being the largest known species out of all the antelopes on the African continent.

ADVERTISEMENT

The eland is found mainly in the southern, eastern, and central parts of the continent. The eland’s preferred habitats are montane areas, coastal plains, and semi-arid areas. There are two different species of eland, the common eland and the giant eland. The giant eland, as the name implies, is extremely large for an ungulate with a body length of between 220 to 290 cm or 86 to 114 inches.

The Giant Eland is a vulnerable species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Giant elands have spiral shape horns, and their coat is usually a reddish-brown or chestnut color. The giant eland is found in Western Africa near the countries of Senegal and Mali, and found in Eastern Africa near South Sudan and Cameroon. Meanwhile, the common eland is found on the plains and savannas of southern and eastern Africa.

Gerenuk

Gerenuks are a species of antelope that can be found in the eastern portion of Africa, and they are known for their particularly long necks. Gerenuks can be found in the Horn of Africa as well as drier regions of East Africa. Male gerenuks usually weigh somewhere around 45 kg, while the females of the species are usually around 35 kg. The males of the species are also taller than the females, though only by a few centimeters.

While gerenuks are diurnal and thus mainly active during the day, during the hottest parts of the day they usually rest in the shade of trees, spending the rest of the day foraging for food. The long neck of the gerenuk has given it the moniker “giraffe gazelle”, and because of its neck, it can more easily eat high foliage than competitors in its region. Gerenuks are usually either reddish-brown with lighter regions on their rears.

Impala

Impalas are known for their elegant and graceful appearance, as well as their incredible leaping. Male impalas usually weigh somewhere between 46 to 76 kg while females of the species weigh around 37 to 50 kilograms. Impalas are capable of leaping around 3 m or 10 feet into the air, and can cover distances of around 10 m or 33 feet forward. Impalas are also known for a behavior called stotting, where they leap into the air and kick their hind legs and then lands on all fours. This odd movement may help confuse predators about the direction the animal is moving in.

Impalas can be found throughout eastern and southern Africa, with between 2 to 6 different subspecies. The common Impala is of least concern according to the IUCN, while the black-faced impala is considered vulnerable by the IUCN.

Klipspringer

Klipspringers are rather small when compared to other antelope, being only about 58 centimeters tall at the shoulder. They inhabit the rocky hillsides of Eastern and southern Africa. Klipspringers can jump impressively high, around 25 feet in height, which is a distance that is approximately 15 times its own height of between 43 – 60 centimeters (17 – 24 inches) tall at the shoulder.

Klipspringers are mainly nocturnal, and are the most active on moonlit nights, foraging for fruits, flowers, and grasses. Klipspringers are also known for their monogamous behavior, which is unusual amongst many antelope. Klipspringers often exhibit life-long pair bonding.

Nyala

Nyalas don’t have quite the geographic range that some of the other antelopes on this list do, being located only in parts of southeast Africa including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, and Malawi. Nyalas have spiral horns and are known for their sexual dimorphism, with males and females of the species being quite different in coloration and size.

The male nyala is dark brown with a number of white vertical stripes running down his body, while the female of the species is a reddish-brown with white vertical stripes. The males of the species can be a good 20 centimeters taller than the females. The nyala tends to be the most active and dawn and dusk, preferring to forage when day temperatures are relatively low, spending the hot hours of the day in clumps of thick brush. Nyala tend to congregate around watering holes in groups of between two to ten members.

Roan

The Roan antelope can be found throughout much of Africa, in the southern, eastern, western, and central portions of the continent. It is one of the largest species of antelope’s overall, measuring around 190 – 240 cm (75 – 94 inches) tall and weighing between 242 to 300 kg (534 – 660 pounds) and the females of the species weighing in around 223 – 280 kilograms overall (492 – 617 lbs).

The roan gets its name from the antelope’s red/brown coat. The roan antelope is often confused with the Sable antelope, and its distinguishing characteristics are its horns (which are shorter than other species), its cloven hooves, its goat-like beard, and it’s tasseled ears.

Sable Antelope

The sable antelope is an antelope which inhabits regions of East Africa and South Africa, spread throughout Kenya and Angola. There are four different subspecies of the sable antelope: the southern sable, the giant sable antelope, and the Zambian sable or eastern sable. Sable antelopes are known for their long, curved, scimitar-shaped horns, which they use to defend themselves from predators, including lions.

Sable antelopes congregate in groups of around 10 to 30 females led by a single bull, while young males will congregate in groups of around 12 individuals. If the herd gets too large it will split up into smaller groups, again lead by only 1 male. The sable antelope is around 120 – 140 cm tall at the shoulder, and it weighs somewhere between 200 to 270 kg. Sable antelopes are sexually dimorphic in nature, with the males generally being larger than the females by about one-fifth. Male sable antelopes usually have a dark brown coat with white hairs below their eyes and on their faces, while females are a slightly lighter chestnut brown.

Waterbuck

The waterbuck is a species of antelope found throughout sub-Saharan Africa. There are 13 different subspecies of the waterbuck, usually divided into two different groups: the Defassa waterbuck and the Ellispumnus waterbuck. The various subspecies of waterbucks are sexually dimorphic in nature with the males generally being much heavier and taller than the females. Male waterbucks are usually around 127 cm or 50 inches tall at their shoulders, while the females of the species are usually around 120 cm or 47 inches tall. Waterbucks have long, large spiral horns that are curved backwards and can be between 55 to 99 cm or 22 to 39 inches long.

Waterbucks tend to be rather sedentary compared to other kinds of antelope, much less likely to migrate. However, some groups may migrate during the start of the monsoon season. Waterbucks usually form herds that are made up of between 6 to 30 members. Despite their name, they don’t actually spend much time in the water, though the waterbuck may shelter in the water to escape predators.

Wildebeest

Wildebeests, also sometimes called gnus, are a type of antelope found within the large, wide-open plains and savannas of East and South Africa. There are two different species of wildebeest, the blue wildebeest and the black wildebeests. These two different species of wildebeest have different physical attributes and habitats.

The blue wildebeest is typically a little larger than the black wildebeest, with the males of the species coming in at around 150 cm tall and weighing around 250 kg while the females of the species way around an 80 kg and are around 105 cm tall. Meanwhile, the males of the black wildebeest species are usually around 20 cm tall and 180 kilograms in weight while the females are about 155 kg in weight and around 108 cm tall.

The blue wildebeest can be found in a wider variety of habitats than the black wildebeest, which usually limits itself only to open grasslands. The black wildebeest species usually migrate only a short distance between seasons while the blue wildebeest usually engages and much longer migrations, and during the migrations, many of the antelope die while crossing rivers and being preyed on by alligators or drowning.",African Antelope Types,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vc2NpZW5jZXRyZW5kcy5jb20vYWZyaWNhbi1hbnRlbG9wZS10eXBlcy_SATVodHRwczovL3NjaWVuY2V0cmVuZHMuY29tL2FmcmljYW4tYW50ZWxvcGUtdHlwZXMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://sciencetrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1024px-Black-faced_impala_Aepyceros_melampus_petersi_male_2-700x467.jpg,2018-11-13,"{'sent': 'In addition, the majority of content on Science Trends is written by the primary author of the peer-reviewed research in which they are writing.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Science Trends']}}","Science Trends relies on peer-reviewed scientific journals and authoritative science publications for references.

Antelopes are many different species of ungulate that can be found in parts of Eurasia and Africa. African antelopes can be found almost all throughout the African continent. Though some people think of a singular animal when they hear the term antelope, antelope refers to many different species be found in different regions around the world.

The term is actually used to describe members of the bovidae family that aren’t goats, sheep, or cattle. There are currently around 90 different recognized species of antelopes, most of which are native to Africa. Let’s examine some of the most interesting types of antelopes found in Africa.

Eland

The eland is a notable amongst African antelopes for being the largest known species out of all the antelopes on the African continent.

The eland is found mainly in the southern, eastern, and central parts of the continent. The eland’s preferred habitats are montane areas, coastal plains, and semi-arid areas. There are two different species of eland, the common eland and the giant eland. The giant eland, as the name implies, is extremely large for an ungulate with a body length of between 220 to 290 cm or 86 to 114 inches.

The Giant Eland is a vulnerable species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Giant elands have spiral shape horns, and their coat is usually a reddish-brown or chestnut color. The giant eland is found in Western Africa near the countries of Senegal and Mali, and found in Eastern Africa near South Sudan and Cameroon. Meanwhile, the common eland is found on the plains and savannas of southern and eastern Africa.

Mammals pay highest toll on Colombia’s highways

Plans to double Colombia’s highway network by 2035 represent a major threat to wildlife conservation. A roadkill app and research have documented some 11,000 roadkill incidents, with mammals most affected, particularly the Andean white-eared opossum (Didelphis pernigra). Researchers cite various low-cost strategies, but connectivity corridors could be the best conservation solution, provided planners know where to place them.

Seaweed market imperils Chile’s marine forests

The unfettered growth of the world’s seaweed market has put Chile’s marine refuges in a “situation of high vulnerability,” according to a National Fisheries Service report. Overharvesting of seaweed is clearing marine forests that are crucial for the reproduction and refuge of more than 150 species, including sharks, manta rays and shellfish. Ninety percent is exported as dried, cut seaweed to China, Japan, Norway and France for spices, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and animal feed.

The outsize heft of China’s energy investments in Ecuador

The rapid growth of China’s presence and investments in Ecuador has resulted in political and economic dependence on Beijing, a recent report says. Since 2009, Chinese companies have invested $12.49 billion in the country — more than the loans issued by multilateral lenders in the same period ($10.165 billion). The human rights and environmental track records of the Chinese companies has prompted the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to consider recommendations from indigenous Amazonian groups in evaluating China in its recent Universal Periodic Review.

Shark fin soup slashes Peru’s shark populations

If current levels of fishing continue, there will probably be no more female hammerhead sharks in Peru’s waters in 30 to 50 years, says Peruvian marine biologist Sebastián Hernández. “Probably your children’s children will play with plastic sharks like we played with dinosaurs, since they will be extinct,” he said. The Chinese appetite for shark fin soup continues to drive the market, and Peru is the biggest exporter of shark fins in Latin America.

Peru’s newest protected area is home to over 500 species

Monte Puyo, Peru’s newest conservation area, is one of the country’s largest wildlife reserves with more than 500 species living in this Amazon cloud forest. These include the critically endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Oreonax flavicauda) and the ochre-fronted antpitta (Grallaricula ochraceifrons), a bird found only in Peru.

Honduran preserve loses 40 football fields of forest a day

Cattle ranching has taken a massive bite out of the Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve in Honduras, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the past five years the reserve has lost 390 square kilometers (150 square miles) of forest, mostly for cattle pasture, out of a total area of 5,250 square kilometers (2,030 square miles). That equates to a loss of 22 hectares (54 acres), or about 40 football fields, every day during that period.

Key points: Northern bettongs survive on a diet of truffles for the majority of the year

Approximately 2,500 northern bettongs are left in the wild Feral cats, poor land management and fire pose the biggest threats

The five-year WWF-Australia-funded project — which tracked the northern bettong — found there had been a 70 per cent decline in the marsupial's population in the past 30 years.

Project leader Caitlin Weatherstone said scientists were relieved to find the bettongs in two regions.

""We were able to find them in two areas, one in the Lamb Range north of Cairns and one in the Mount Carbine Tableland, west of the Daintree,"" Ms Weatherstone said.

""But that's where the good news ends. We didn't find them anywhere else in their previous range.

""We zoned in on 11 key areas and we were only able to find them in two.""

The northern bettong has expensive tastes, surviving for most of the year solely on truffles.

Ms Whitehouse said their diet was key to the survival of the region's forests.

She explained: ""The northern bettongs dig up truffles, they smell beautiful to them, and they eat them.

""That process helps the truffle disperse its spores.

""And in turn, they grow on the roots of the eucalypts in the area, which helps them grow.

""If you lose one step of that process, biodiversity suffers.""

Predators such as feral cats, poor land management, and fire are known threats to the approximately 2,500 northern bettongs left in the wild.

The northern bettong project has prompted calls to establish an ""insurance population"" by fencing off an area to predators or moving some of the animals to an island, to make sure the marsupials do not disappear completely.

Tim Cronin from WWF-Australia pointed out the bushfires that ravaged Queensland had the power to decimate the tiny northern bettong population.

""That gave us a really stark reminder that, particularly with climate change, those kinds of fires are increasing in intensity and frequency.

""All it's going to take is one of those to wipe out this population, so we need to stop that happening,"" Mr Cronin added.

The plight of the northern bettong has prompted fresh calls to speed up protection measures for other endangered animals.

A recent report by the Queensland Audit Office found it was taking up to seven years between assessing and studying animals at risk and state authorities acting to protect them.

And a Senate inquiry is currently investigating Australia's threatened species crisis including environment laws and funding arrangements.

Mr Cronin said any delays in protecting the northern bettong could be deadly: ""We want everything to be based on the most rigorous and up-to-date science.

""But that can also translate to sitting on our hands.

""When it comes to threatened species and ecology we'll never have all the information, but often we'll have enough information to act.

""We need to get on the front foot, not sit around and wait.""

Queensland's Environment Department said it had been directly involved in protecting the northern bettong for several years.

It added the State Government would continue to work closely with WWF-Australia and other organisations to protect the remaining population.","Rare truffle-eating marsupial crucial to Queensland's ecosystem declines by 70 per cent, study reveals",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDE4LTEyLTA2L2RldmFzdGF0aW5nLWRlY2xpbmUtb2Ytbm9ydGhlcm4tYmV0dG9uZ3MtcXVlZW5zbGFuZC8xMDU4NjQ3MtIBJ2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvYXJ0aWNsZS8xMDU4NjQ3Mg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.abc.net.au/cm/rimage/10586528-16x9-large.jpg?v=2,2018-12-05,"{'sent': ""A rare native marsupial crucial to the survival of Queensland's tropical ecosystem is facing a deadly decline, a new study has revealed.\n\n"", 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Queensland']}}","A rare native marsupial crucial to the survival of Queensland's tropical ecosystem is facing a deadly decline, a new study has revealed.

Researchers are calling for urgent measures to save the northern bettong from extinction after a five-year study found just two remaining populations of the animal in the wild.

The research, led by WWF Australia working with the Queensland government and scientists from James Cook University, has recommended state and federal governments look to establish insurance populations for the small marsupial known as the “rat kangaroo”.

Northern bettongs are endemic to far north Queensland and their numbers have declined dramatically since European colonisation.

Studies from the 1980s suggested the animal could be found in four areas – Mount Windsor, the Carbine tableland, Lamb range and Coane range.

The project team for the latest population study used trapping and 587 sensor cameras to search for the species in nearly 100,000ha of the wet tropics.

The results, published by WWF on Thursday, only found northern bettongs at Lamb range and Mount Spurgeon in the Carbine tableland, with no trace of the species detected at either Mount Windsor or Coane range.

The project team said this meant the number of distinct populations had halved and that the total land area the animals occupied had fallen by about 70% – from 500 square kilometres to 145 square kilometres – in the past three decades.

They estimate there are at most 2,500 animals left in the wild and that only the population at Lamb range could be considered stable.

“It is clear from the results of this project that northern bettong populations have suffered drastic reductions over the last three decades,” the report states.

It says the decline in the species has been caused by factors including changes in climate, land management practices, predation by feral animals, habitat clearance and changed fire regimes.

The scientists have called on the federal government to upgrade the species threat status from endangered to critically endangered, and for both state and federal governments to consider options for an insurance population.

“This is a pretty alarming decline for the northern bettong,” said Tim Cronin, the senior manager of species conservation at WWF Australia. “If we don’t do something soon, we will lose them.

“Any time you’ve got a species with only one stable population left in the wild, it leaves it really vulnerable to things like a fire event.”

He said while there were risks associated with translocating animals to establish new populations, the research team believed it was necessary to explore it in this case.

It has also called for the existing populations to be properly protected and their habitat restored.

The Senate is examining Australia’s fauna extinction crisis.

Conservationists have called for better resourcing and coordination of threatened species work so that more Australian wildlife does not suffer the same fate as the Bramble Cay melomys, a tiny rodent that went extinct in 2009 after governments failed to act in time to save it.

The northern bettong project team said its study was another example of species decline that was occurring across the country.

Caitlin Weatherstone, a wildlife ecologist who worked on the project, said if the animal was lost it would have knock-on effects for the surrounding ecosystem.

The project found the marsupial played an important role in its environment because it was one of the main animals that ate truffles and dispersed truffle spores through its habitat.

Its decline could affect truffle biodiversity in these areas “with unknown consequences for plant-fungal interactions and ecosystem health”, the report said.

“If we lose that animal out of the ecosystem we don’t know what’s going to happen,” Weatherstone said. “It will affect forest health but we don’t know by how much at this point.”

A spokesperson for Queensland’s department of environment and science said about 80% of the northern bettong’s habitat was on land managed by the Queensland parks and wildlife service.

As a result of the population study, the department had produced an updated field guide for the management of fire in northern bettong habitat.

“With the department’s collaborators, JCU and WWF-Australia, DES will consider the report to determine the best way forward from this point,” the spokesperson said.

0,"""The northern bettong is so important ... it's a real driver of forest health,"" she said. When Europeans arrived in Australia more than 200 years ago, the northern bettong lived in tall open forests in a 1000-kilometre-long stretch north along the Great Dividing Range from central Queensland. Since then the northern bettong population has dropped by 90 per cent. A study by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, James Cook University and the WWF shows stark findings on the future of the northern bettong. The research included three years of fieldwork, where 585 cameras recorded more than 500,000 images of bettongs, their predators and their environment over 90,000 hectares.

Until the five-year study ecologists thought they lived in five locations. The northern bettong now lives in just two locations; the Lamb Range, inland from Cairns, and Mt Spurgeon, further north, in the Mossman hinterland. Northern bettong caught by one of the 585 cameras in the three years of field work. The marsupial has been reduced to live in a 145-square-kilometre area in the forests of Queensland’s tropical mountain ranges west of Cairns. The northern bettong is classified as endangered but researchers have suggested they should be classified as critically endangered.

The report executive concludes the northern bettong's ""meta-population"" in the Lamb Range could become extinct within the next 10 years. The Lamb Range is the northern bettong's most stable population. James Cook University lecturer Dr Sandra Abell said the team trapped 188 northern bettongs in the Lamb Range and estimated there was a stable population of about 2500. ""The good news is that the tropical bettong is stable in their core habitat,"" Dr Abell said. ""Nevertheless, actual numbers are likely to be at most 2500, which is much lower than the 5000-10,000 estimated in their original 'endangered' status listing with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature,"" Dr Abell said.

Researchers found 77 different species of truffles within the faeces, of the northern bettong, meaning they have a valuable role in regenerating forest trees. Habitat clearing is not the biggest danger to the endangered species. This time it is cats. Feral cats. ""An increase in juvenile mortality rate, particularly from predation by feral cats, was the greatest threat to the northern bettong’s survival,"" the study finds. Poor fire burning techniques and feral pigs digging up grasslands in the tall forest understory were also major problems.

Wildlife ecologist Caitlin Weatherstone Credit:Stephanie Todd Byron Bay wildlife ecologist Caitlin Weatherstone was one of the principal authors of the five-year study and spent months setting traps and tracking the northern bettong. She said while it was difficult to find the feral cats, the team’s researchers believe they were the critical threat to the northern bettong. ""Cats are highly intelligent and they are difficult to capture on camera,"" Ms Weatherstone said. ""They smell humans and they just know not to go near cameras,"" she said.

However, feral cats were found at 40 per cent of the 11 crucial locations in the three years of field research during the five-year study. The problem is the small northern bettong, which weighs about one kilogram, is perfect prey for feral cats, she said. ""Cats and dogs just love them this size,"" the ecologist said. Feral cats are the major threat to the northern bettong. Credit:Stephanie Todd. Cattle and feral pigs were also found at 80 per cent of the study areas.

The pigs can compete for the truffles and the pigs and cattle also have an impact by altering habitat. Dr Susan Nuske from James Cook University said the role of the northern bettong was irreplaceable in spreading the forest truffles. ""By eating so many unique species, the northern bettong plays an irreplaceable role in spreading truffle fungi,"" Dr Nuske said.

Some of these acres were home to small, endemic species found nowhere else in the world. On Indonesia’s Sulawesi Island, Rainforest Trust added 72 acres to a now 47,328-acre protected network of coastal habitat. This area is a key nesting location for the Endangered Maleo, an iconic turkey-like bird. We also added five parcels of vital riparian habitat to the buffer zone of Nepal’s Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve. Here, we’ve protected 485 different bird species on 42,560 acres, including the Critically Endangered Bengal Florican.

In a small but mighty declaration, we protected 20 acres in Fiji which includes a cave that is home to 95 percent of the global population of the Endangered Fijian Free-tailed Bat. The community hosted an elaborate dedication ceremony for the new Nakanacagi Cave Reserve that included traditional song, dance, and feasting.

Communities were also in support of ecological corridors for far-ranging charismatic species. In Malaysia, Rainforest Trust helped created and then expanded the new Kenyir State Park to 74,140 acres. This park permanently protects precious habitat for the Critically Endangered Malayan Tiger while overturning a major logging concession valued at $45 million in timber.

The emerging Lumbasumba Conservation Area will be the crucial link in a mosaic of protected areas across the Himalayas of southern China, Nepal and India. The corridor will ultimately unite 14 million acres – an area vital for Snow Leopards, Red Panda and other threatened species.

Rainforest Trust continues to strengthen protective measures for our reserves and parks. For example, on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia we purchased a property and establishing a new ranger training facility while in Myanmar, we’re building a guard station at the Mahamyaing Wildlife Sanctuary.

From the Pacific islands of Palau, Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia, to India, Cambodia and Vietnam, Rainforest Trust continues its work to protect at risk rainforests. And next year we start a major effort to assist new reserves in Papua, Laos and Thailand.

“Asia’s incredible biodiversity is threatened by the rate and scale of development in the region,” shared Angela Yang, Rainforest Trust Asia Conservation Director. “It is quite literally a race against time to create these critical protected areas to ensure the survival of globally threatened species and their habitats.”

Our in-country partners and Rainforest Trust’s Fellows and Guardians coordinate these projects on the ground. Seventeen Rainforest Trust Fellows joined our ranks in Asia and the Pacific this year, performing essential tasks to create new reserves and parks. Furthermore, 21 Rainforest Trust Guardians are on the frontlines of protecting endangered species and reserves across the region.

Lacoste recently announced that it would be adopting a temporary logo to help endangered species — offering limited editions of each animal in relation to how many of the species there are left in the wild. And, they’re not the only one.

Save Our Species — Lacoste

Are you familiar with the #LacosteSaveOurSpecies campaign? If you aren’t, you’ve definitely seen it! A part of this, they replaced their classic crocodile logo with images of endangered species on their classic polo shirts.

Creatively, the fashion magnet released limited editions of each polo shirt — by releasing the number of how many the associated species were left in the world. The new logos were designed using the same green colouring and style as the iconic crocodile.

The animals that were chosen were ten of the most threatened species on the planet; the Vaquita, Burmese Turtle, Northern Sportive Lemur, Javan Rhino, Kakapo, Cao-vit Gibbon, California Condor, Saola, Sumatran Tiger and the Anegada Ground Iguana.

Launching at Paris Fashion Week, they were an instant hit and sold out completely. The money from the shirts was donated towards the fight for wildlife conservation worldwide.

Tighter gun control — Gucci

Gucci has taking a stand and is fighting for improved gun legislation, even donating half a million dollars to the cause. “We stand with March For Our Lives and the fearless students across the country who demand that their lives and safety become a priority. We have all been directly or indirectly impacted by these senseless tragedies, and Gucci is proud to join this movement with a donation of $500,000” was one comment by Gucci at the time.

The brand woke up after the school shooting in 2017 which left 17 people dead. It’s possible that Gucci’s generous donation was motivated by the death of Gucci salesman, Javier Jorge-Reyes, and injury of Gucci store manager, Leonel Melendez Jr — both caused by gun violence.

The Prince’s Trust — Charles Tyrwhitt

White slim fit shirts seller, Charles Tyrwhitt work regularly with Prince Charles’ charity, The Prince’s Trust. This is a charity in the United Kingdom, founded in 1976 by Charles, Prince of Wales. It focuses on helping vulnerable people get their lives back on track and find work.

The brand created custom scarves, ties and umbrellas for the cause. Where each item in the collection is sold, £5 is donated to The Prince’s Trust.

As well as this, employees at Charles Tyrwhitt are also involved with raising money. In fact, business founder, Nick Wheeler, raised over 100,000 when he completed an 874-mile bike ride from Land’s End to John O’ Groats in the UK. And, members of the company attend and recruit individuals through The Prince’s Trust ‘Get Hired’ Days. This is where young people who have been through The Trust’s programmes have found themselves ready to move into work and are actively looking for work.

Watch Hunger Stop — Michael Kors

High-end brand, Michael Kors launched its Watch Hunger Stop campaign back in 2013. According to the Michael Kors website, they’ve helped the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) deliver 15 million meals to children in need.

In 2018, to celebrate the campaign’s fifth anniversary, Kate Hudson pledged her support and joined in the fun! There are many ways that people can donate — through the purchase of a timepiece, a Snapchat using a store geofilter or through posting a photo wearing a Watch Hunger Stop T-shirt. Each action donates a certain amount of money and corresponding meals to children in need — the programme supports 16 million children over 70 different countries.

Sustainable fashion — Stella McCartney

Stella McCartney is renowned for her service to the environment in relation to fashion. She continually makes a difference with regards to environmental fashion and sustainability. Using the latest in eco-friendly technology, she changes attitudes to sustainable fashion and demonstrates how eco-fashion can be done.

Did you know there is now no fur or leather in her products! Take her latest swimwear range for example, in partnership with Adidas. The swimsuits are made from Lycra Xtra Lite fabric, which is resistant to chlorine and uses recycled Parley Ocean Plastic yarn.

The participation of the Foundation in the project to save the Yellow-eared Parrot, together with the ProAves Foundation of Colombia, has been fundamental in the achievement that today the wild population of these birds has multiplied and has reached record numbers. The story that has marked their survival began in the mid-1990s, when the Loro Parque Foundation supported the protection of the last 20 birds in Ecuador. In 1988 they had disappeared and it was feared that the species had become completely extinct; however, in the same year the Ognorhynchus project began with the aim of ensuring the survival of the species and its habitat in the Colombian Andes.

After a year-long search, a population of 81 individuals was found in the central Andes, in the community of Roncesvalles, whilst in January 2001 a second population of 63 individuals appeared in the foothills of the western Andes in Jardín, in the Department of Antioquia. In the years since the collaboration began, the Foundation has been the principal architect of an initiative that may become the most successful in all of South America. And, in fact, such has been the recovery rate that in 2010 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) reduced the Yellow-eared Parrot’s threat category from ‘critically endangered’ to ‘endangered’.

This animal has a close relationship with wax palms, Colombia’s national tree, also threatened by cattle grazing and by its indiscriminate use in the celebration of Palm Sunday. Years of research into habitat use, diet, distribution, and reproductive behavior have provided a solid foundation on the threats to the species and the wax palm, thus enabling a global conservation action plan.

Among the different initiatives implemented within the framework of this project, they were also able to count on the collaboration of the Vatican.

This animal has a close relationship with wax palms, Colombia’s national tree, also threatened by cattle grazing and by its indiscriminate use in the celebration of Palm Sunday. Years of research into habitat use, diet, distribution, and reproductive behavior have provided a solid foundation on the threats to the species and the wax palm, thus enabling a global conservation action plan.

Among the different initiatives implemented within the framework of this project, they were also able to count on the collaboration of the Vatican. In spite of the roots of this religious tradition, the close collaboration of the Church and a good educational program have made it possible for everyone to use other alternatives today.","[{'CARDINAL', 'more than 8,000'}, {'LOC', 'the Canary Islands'}, {'Colombia', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Yellow'}, {'PERSON', 'Parrot'}, {'Archipelago', 'LOC'}, {'Loro Parque Foundation', 'ORG'}, {'Foundation', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Yellow'}, {'PERSON', 'Parrot'}, {'the ProAves Foundation of Colombia', 'ORG'}, {'today', 'DATE'}, {'the mid-1990s', 'DATE'}, {'the Loro Parque Foundation', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', '20'}, {'Ecuador', 'GPE'}, {'1988', 'DATE'}, {'the same year', 'DATE'}, {'ORG', 'Ognorhynchus'}, {'the Colombian Andes', 'FAC'}, {'DATE', 'year-long'}, {'CARDINAL', '81'}, {'Andes', 'LOC'}, {'Roncesvalles', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'January 2001'}, {'ORDINAL', 'second'}, {'CARDINAL', '63'}, {'Andes', 'LOC'}, {'Jardín', 'GPE'}, {'the Department of Antioquia', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', 'the years'}, {'Foundation', 'ORG'}, {'South America', 'LOC'}, {'DATE', '2010'}, {'the International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Yellow'}, {'PERSON', 'Parrot'}, {'Colombia', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'Palm Sunday.'}, {'FAC', 'Vatican'}, {'Church', 'ORG'}, {'today', 'DATE'}]","['the Canary Islands', 'Colombia', 'Archipelago', 'Loro Parque Foundation', 'Foundation', 'the ProAves Foundation of Colombia', 'the Loro Parque Foundation', 'Ecuador', 'Ognorhynchus', 'Andes', 'Roncesvalles', 'Andes', 'Jardín', 'the Department of Antioquia', 'Foundation', 'South America', 'the International Union for Conservation of Nature', 'Colombia', 'Church']"
0,"The conservation of the Milky Stork (Mycteria cinerea), an endangered wading bird native to South-east Asia, is threatened due to crossbreeding with its more common cousin, the Painted Stork (Mycteria leucocephala), researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS) have discovered.

""Apart from habitat loss and fragmentation, extinction through hybridisation is one of the major threats to endangered species,"" said the research lead, Assistant Professor Frank Rheindt from the Department of Biological Sciences at the NUS Faculty of Science.

The research, which was conducted with Wildlife Reserves Singapore, was published in the journal Biological Conservation.

The scientists analysed tissue samples of 46 captive and wild storks, and their results showed significant genomic ""contamination"": More than half of the sampled storks were affected by ""genetic infiltration"" from the Painted Stork.

Although originating from a limited number of introduced Painted Storks, these hybrids were now an integral part of both the wild and captive Singapore and southern Peninsular Malaysia stork population, NUS said in the same statement.

The study was the first to provide an estimate on the population genomic status of the endangered Milky Stork in Singapore, and the findings could contribute to the design of effective solutions for conservation management of the globally at-risk species, said Prof Rheindt.

The team recommended identifying and isolating hybrid storks in bird parks, zoos and the wild locally from pure Milky Storks to prevent cross-breeding, and conducting thorough genetic analysis to ensure the purity of an individual stork in any planned breeding programme or release.

0,"The bruises on his face soon may heal, but the broken heart of Victor Vasquez — the Birdman of East Village — may take a while longer.

“Sydney, the day before he died, I told him, ‘You’re the reason I wake up in the morning,” Vasquez said this week of his 31-year-old medium sulphur-crested cockatoo from Papua New Guinea, one of his three feathered companions.

“He was just an amazing soul.”

The bird was killed during an attack on Vasquez, which he said occurred Wednesday in front of the San Diego Central Library. Vasquez said he was punched, kicked and knocked to the ground by two unknown assailants.

While Vasquez was being beaten, two of his birds got loose from their cages. One of them, Sydney, flew into the path of a passing trolley and was killed.

Vasquez, 54, had become known as the Birdman of East Village for his daily walks around downtown and Balboa Park with a tower of three birdcages strapped to his back. He and his three-tiered backpacks and squawking birds had become a fun and quirky sight in the year and a half he’s lived downtown, and he was featured in a San Diego Reader article last March.

On Wednesday morning, he said, he slipped on his birdcage backpack and headed out of his small apartment on Market Street to the library to return a rented DVD.

Advertisement

He dropped off the DVD in a slot without entering the library, and said a security guard told him to move along. Vasquez said he was leaving when a young man sitting on a nearby wall said something like, “Yeah, get out of here with your dirty clothes.”

Words were exchanged, but Vasquez said he walked away. When he saw the young man heading toward him, he called 911. The San Diego Police Department reported receiving the call at 9:47 a.m.

Vasquez said the man struck him, knocked him down and was joined by a female companion who also hit and kicked him. He said both assailants appeared young, around 18 years old.

The cages popped open. Ginger, a Goffin’s cockatoo from Australia, flew into a nearby tree. Between blows, Vasquez said he could see Sydney flying toward the trolley.

Advertisement

He remembers a woman saying Sydney had been run over. Vasquez managed to get to his feet and walk to the tracks. He scooped up Sydney’s mangled body.

“I can’t get the image out of my mind,” he said through tears.

Vasquez said police arrived but he felt they did not believe his story until they saw security camera footage. (The Union-Tribune was unable to confirm Friday whether police had obtained or reviewed any surveillance video, and the newspaper was not able to locate the video independently.)

Advertisement

He said he hopes witnesses will come forward to help identify the assailants.

He was able to retrieve Ginger and also still has Coocooberry, a red-lored green Amazon parrot about 20 years old.

“They’re my life,” he said about his birds, which have helped him deal with some tough times.

Vasquez was homeless off and on for about 10 years and said he is HIV positive and has PTSD from injuries sustained in an encounter with police during a demonstration in San Francisco in 1989.

Sydney was his favorite of the three birds, and even through his grief, Vasquez is able to smile at the bird’s memory.

“He gave me so much,” he said. “That’s what I have to hold on to. He was so intelligent. He loved to be held and praised. Sydney was my best friend.”

The case has been assigned to a San Diego police detective and is under investigation, but no other information about any possible suspects was available Friday. Anyone with information about the incident can call Crime Stoppers at (619) 235-8477 and refer to case number 19004063.

In what could be billed as the fight for the African elephant, two camps are pulling in different directions over the fate of the continent’s foremost pachyderm.

One camp, led by Kenya and made up of Benin, Burkina Faso, Liberia, Niger and Togo, wants tighter controls to curb illicit killing of the mammal for tusks while the other — comprised of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Zambia – wants looser restrictions.

Countries are expected to submit their proposals to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites) for consideration at the 18th meeting of Conference of Parties (CoP18) in Colombo, Sri Lanka from May 23 to June.

The Kenyan group proposes the transfer of Southern Africa elephants from appendix II to appendix I of Cites. This would make any future “one-off” ivory sales by the Southern Africa nations extremely difficult.

Appendix I, of species threatened with extinction allows trade in exceptional circumstances.

Appendix II includes species not threatened with extinction and trade has strict regulation to avoid utilisation incompatible with survival.

Appendix III is for species that any country identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction to prevent or restrict exploitation and it requires the co-operation of other countries to control international trade.

To counter this call, Zambia is proposing its elephant population be moved from appendix I to II to allow future sales of government-owned ivory stockpiles.

It wants to use ivory sales money for community projects and conservation. Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa want to sell off stockpiles of raw ivory.

Zimbabwe dismisses the Kenya-led proposal to move its elephants to appendix I as lacking justification for placing healthy populations in Zimbabwe with other range states of Southern Africa in the same category as populations in West, Central and East Africa.

“African elephant conservation will benefit from appreciating that contexts are different with different measures applied in different states at various scales. Appendix I is not a panacea for threat reduction,’’ said Zimbabwe.

African range countries in 2010 agreed on the African Elephant Action Plan to tackle poaching while also targeting transit countries and markets like China.

Trade

The Southern Africa countries propose trade in hides, trade in hair and trade in leather goods for commercial or non-commercial purposes for Botswana, Namibia and South Africa and for non-commercial purposes for Zimbabwe.

The region is also calling for trade in individually marked and certified ivory incorporated in finished jewellery for non-commercial purposes for Namibia and ivory carvings for non-commercial purposes for Zimbabwe.

The countries also want trade in registered raw ivory (for Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, whole tusks and pieces) subject to only registered government-owned stocks excluding seized ivory and tusks of unknown origin.

1990 ban

International trade in elephant ivory was banned in 1990. Britain, China and the US have today banned ivory sales.

Hong Kong in 2014 promised to phase out the elephant tusks trade by 2021. Thailand, Laos and Vietnam are big ivory markets. Europe is the biggest exporter of legal ivory.

Environmental lobby WildAid chief executive Peter Knights said relaxing of ivory trade restrictions could lead to a massive increase in the killing of elephants as past Cites one-off sales have failed to stem the demand for tusks.

Cites allowed Japan and China in 1999 and 2008 respectively, to buy tusks in experimental sales that enabled traffickers to ply their trade because of the difficulty of distinguishing legal ivory from the one poached.

In other proposals, Namibia wants Cites to transfer its rhino population from appendix I to II to allow trade only in live animals and hunting trophies. Eswatini has proposal for international trade in rhino horns for commercial purposes.

It is estimated that 20,000 southern white rhino in Africa remain threatened by poaching for horns. Poaching has escalated enormously in recent years in South Africa which is home to around 90 per cent of the southern white rhino population.

It is estimated Namibia currently has 1,946 rhinos. Poaching of black rhinos and white rhinos in Namibia jumped from zero in 2006 to 30 in 2014 and tripled to 90 one year later. The majority of rhinos poached in Namibia between 2014 and 2016 were black rhinos.

“The geographical shift in poaching to Namibia over the past two years is worrying,” said the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Woolly mammoth

Meanwhile, Israel wants to list on appendix II the woolly mammoth, which was roughly the same size as modern African elephant. Woolly mammoth went extinct about 11,700 years ago.

It will be the first time an extinct species is listed as protected under Cites.

Israel’s move is in response to the growing trade in mammoth ivory which is popular as a legal alternative to elephant tusks in carvings. To get around the elephant ivory ban, traders sometimes mix the two ivories.

“They are often intermingled in shipment and retail displays. To the untrained eye it is difficult to distinguish between them,” said global animals conservation lobby Humane Society International’s senior specialist for wildlife programme and policy Iris Ho.

Currently there is no international regulatory regime to track and monitor commercial trade in mammoth ivory.

Fifty-seven proposals to amend species lists have been submitted by 90 countries for consideration at the CoP18.

Cites has received 140 documents that propose new measures with policies on international trade in wild fauna and flora.

The CoP18 agenda includes global trade in timber, white rhino, saiga antelope and giraffe. It could affect the protection status of 18 fish species, birds, 51 reptiles, 17 mammals, 457 amphibians, 20 invertebrates and 407 plants.

Proposals on reptiles include four from the meeting’s host country alongside US, that want the tiger spiders native to Sri Lanka and India listed.

“Decisions taken at CoP18 will alter conservation and international trade management, have direct impacts on biodiversity, livelihoods of rural communities and national economies,” said Cites secretary general Ivonne Higuero.

Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal are proposing to transfer the black-crowned crane bird from appendix II to I, to prohibit international trade in the species. Black-crowned crane has been on appendix II since 1985.

“The justification for classification is due to habitat loss and trapping for domestication or illegal international trade,” said submission documents to Cites prepared by the three countries.

0,"(CN) – The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Monday it would add the scarlet macaw, one of the most recognizable parrots, to the list of endangered species.

With credit to @Doug88888, the nonprofit Friends of Animals included this photo of the scarlet macaw subspecies Ara macao macao (right) in a complaint filed on July 27, 2018, in Washington, D.C.

Native to the tropics of South and Central America, the scarlet macaw’s dramatic red, yellow and blue feathers make it a popular choice to breed in captivity.

The government listed the macaw as endangered after reviewing 282 public comments, many of which the agency addressed Monday.

Noting the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) considers the scarlet macaw to be of “least concern,” some of the commenters argued the parrot should not be listed under the Endangered Species Act. But Fish and Wildlife said the IUCN has different standards than the United States, and pointed out some subspecies of the macaw are more threatened than others.

Under the agency’s new rule, the northern subspecies of the macaw is listed as endangered, while a distinct population segment of the southern subspecies is listed as threatened.

Though macaws can withstand forest degradation, the destruction of their habitat through deforestation still constitutes a threat to the bird, the agency said.

A group of wildlife advocates sued the government this past July to list the scarlet macaw, highlighting the threats the bird faces from poaching and deforestation.

While deforestation remains a problem in the scarlet macaw’s habitat, there is good news: Unlike other Central American countries, Costa Rica saw an increase in its forest area between 1990 and 2015, gaining nearly 500,000 acres of forest at an annual rate of 19,000 acres a year.

In 2018, a team of researchers analyzed DNA from feathers and skeletons and concluded that indigenous people in the southwestern U.S. and northern Mexico may have been the first macaw breeders in North America. The researchers said they believe someone first set up a small breeding program of macaws near Chaco Canyon in New Mexico.

Also Monday, Fish and Wildlife announced it is seeking comment on its proposal to remove the Borax Lake chub from the endangered list.

The tiny fish has a rather unusual habitat: It is only found around Borax Lake, a 10-acre alkaline lake in the Alvord Desert of Southeastern Oregon. The lake is fed by thermal springs, and sits on top of large deposits of sodium borate.

Geothermal energy production in the region threatened the chub, and in the early 1980s the government designated 640 acres around Borax Lake as critical habitat for the species.

A five-year review of the chub’s status finished in 2012, which concluded the fish is no longer endangered but should be listed as threatened.

Borax Lake saw a record high population of the chub in 2017, and the government noted no hatchery-raised chub have ever been introduced to supplement the existing populations. The population appears to be viable and self-sustainable, the agency said.

The chub is a dwarf species of desert minnow, and is usually about 1.3 to 2 inches long. It is described as an “opportunistic omnivore.”",Feds Set to List Scarlet Macaw as Endangered,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9mZWRzLXNldC10by1kZWxpc3Qtc2NhcmxldC1tYWNhdy1hcy1zcGVjaWVzLXJlYm91bmRzL9IBVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJ0aG91c2VuZXdzLmNvbS9mZWRzLXNldC10by1kZWxpc3Qtc2NhcmxldC1tYWNhdy1hcy1zcGVjaWVzLXJlYm91bmRzLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/scarlet-macaw.png,2019-02-25,"{'sent': '(CN) –', 'ents': {'ORG': ['CN']}}","(CN) – The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Monday it would add the scarlet macaw, one of the most recognizable parrots, to the list of endangered species.

Angola has had a history of slavery and civil wars, but today the country enjoys a general sense of redevelopment and progress. A colony of Portugal for many years, Angola’s unique culture features a mix of Portuguese and traditional African elements. While visiting Angola, spend a few days exploring the densely populated capital, Luanda, before penetrating deeper to see the country’s numerous beaches, parks, and wildlife reserves. Unlike many other African countries, Angola has few tourists, which means you will have the authentic pleasure of experiencing life in the country as Angolans do. We hope you take the opportunity during your visit to Africa to explore a country undergoing rapid change.

What to Do in Angola

1. Kissama National Park: Located in northwestern Angola, Kissama National Park was the site of a massive rehabilitation project called Operation Noah’s Ark. In 2000, sixteen elephants were flown from South Africa to the park; they were followed by zebras, ostriches, wildebeests, and giraffes. While the park is still recuperating from years of neglect, it is easily accessible today and is a great place to spend a day exploring. There are accommodations within the park for overnight stays.

2. Benguela: The Benguela Railway used to connect the city to the Congo and Zambia, but civil wars destroyed the railroad’s infrastructure. While the railroad is slowly being repaired, the only functioning segment is the strip connecting Lobito to Benguela. We recommend taking the train trip and spending a day exploring the streets of Benguela, which boasts colonial Portuguese architecture and sites.

3. National Slavery Museum: This museum is not large, but it packs a big punch. Located just 11 miles (18 kilometers) south of Luanda, it is housed in a small, 17th-century chapel and tells the story of Angola and its involvement in the slave trade. The most intense experience to be had at the museum is the realization that, in that very chapel, millions of slaves were baptized before being sent across the Atlantic Ocean on slave ships. We highly recommend visiting this small but powerful museum.

4. Cangandala National Park: It is the smallest national park in the country, but its woodland environment attracts a large number of birds. The park was founded in 1963 to protect the giant sable antelope, but today it is primarily a great place to hike and see some of Angola’s natural beauty.

5. Calendula Waterfalls: Also called the Duque de Braganca Falls, these amazing waterfalls are located in the province of Malanje. The Calendula falls are some of Africa’s highest and make for a spectacular photo shot.

6. Mussulo Peninsula: If you are looking for a good place to stroll along the water and see the fishing culture of Angola, visit the Mussulo Peninsula, where local fishermen work every day. Located just outside of Luanda, the peninsula offers a great escape for a few hours. We recommend packing a picnic, relaxing next to the water, and going swimming for an afternoon.

7. Santiago Beach: Located 30 miles (45 kilometers) north of Luanda, Santiago Beach bears the nickname “Shipwreck Beach,” because of the massive old ships beached in the shallow water. (One infamous vessel is the Karl Marx.) The ships provide an extraordinary photo opportunity. You can rent a fishing pole and go fishing farther down the coast, where the beaches are pleasant and free of rusty wrecks.

8. Lubango: Surrounded by mountains and blessed with a moderate climate year-round, Lubango is a great place to stop over for a few days. There are daily flights between Lubango and Luanda; you can also hire a car for the six-hour drive. Shopping and dining are activities that visitors usually indulge in during their stay in this high-up city.

9. Benfica Market: This Luanda-based market is full of paintings, animal skins, jewelry, carvings, masks, and more. Unlike at many African markets, the vendors are not known for their aggressiveness; still, feel free to haggle before you make your purchase. Be sure to ask vendors where their goods were created, as much of the art on sale isn’t made in Angola itself.

10. Fort San Miguel: Built in the 16th century by the Portuguese, this former fortress is now a massive tribute to the country’s past. Within the white, fortified walls are ceramic tiles detailing Angola’s history, as well as cannons and old prisoners’ cells. The Museum of the Armed Forces is also within the fort and is definitely worth a visit.

When To Go

The weather varies throughout the country, so be sure to check out forecasts for the specific region you plan on visiting. During the summer season (November to April), the north of the country gets hot and wet, while the south is warm throughout the year. The winter months (May to October) will generally be cooler and drier throughout the country. We recommend traveling during the winter: you’ll be at lower risk of getting caught in the rain.

Getting In and Around

Visas: Make sure your passport is valid for six months past your last day in Angola and that there are two blank consecutive pages available for the visa. You should also have a yellow fever vaccination card with you, in case an official should ask to see it at the airport. You must get a visa for Angola before leaving for your trip. A 90-day, single-entry visa costs $140 as of July 2018. The visa processing can take quite some time, so make sure you apply well in advance of your departure.

Transportation: The main international airport is Quatro (4) de Fevereiro International Airport, located right outside of Luanda. From the airport, you can grab a taxi into the city center.

Traveling between cities in Angola can be an adventure. Train service is very limited and somewhat erratic, and the roads are mostly unpaved. We highly recommend hiring taxis when you travel between cities, or utilizing domestic airlines.Within cities, local buses and taxies are fairly reliable.

Mobile Phones: We recommend taking or buying a SIM card–enabled phone. Mobile reception can be spotty outside of the major cities.

Angola has had a history of slavery and civil wars, but today the country enjoys a general sense of redevelopment and progress. A colony of Portugal for many years, Angola’s unique culture features a mix of Portuguese and traditional African elements. While visiting Angola, spend a few days exploring the densely populated capital, Luanda, before penetrating deeper to see the country’s numerous beaches, parks, and wildlife reserves. Unlike many other African countries, Angola has few tourists, which means you will have the authentic pleasure of experiencing life in the country as Angolans do. We hope you take the opportunity during your visit to Africa to explore a country undergoing rapid change.

What to Do in Angola

1. Kissama National Park: Located in northwestern Angola, Kissama National Park was the site of a massive rehabilitation project called Operation Noah’s Ark. In 2000, sixteen elephants were flown from South Africa to the park; they were followed by zebras, ostriches, wildebeests, and giraffes. While the park is still recuperating from years of neglect, it is easily accessible today and is a great place to spend a day exploring. There are accommodations within the park for overnight stays.

2. Benguela: The Benguela Railway used to connect the city to the Congo and Zambia, but civil wars destroyed the railroad’s infrastructure. While the railroad is slowly being repaired, the only functioning segment is the strip connecting Lobito to Benguela. We recommend taking the train trip and spending a day exploring the streets of Benguela, which boasts colonial Portuguese architecture and sites.

3. National Slavery Museum: This museum is not large, but it packs a big punch. Located just 11 miles (18 kilometers) south of Luanda, it is housed in a small, 17th-century chapel and tells the story of Angola and its involvement in the slave trade. The most intense experience to be had at the museum is the realization that, in that very chapel, millions of slaves were baptized before being sent across the Atlantic Ocean on slave ships. We highly recommend visiting this small but powerful museum.

4. Cangandala National Park: It is the smallest national park in the country, but its woodland environment attracts a large number of birds. The park was founded in 1963 to protect the giant sable antelope, but today it is primarily a great place to hike and see some of Angola’s natural beauty.

Crossbreeding with their more widespread cousin threatens Milky Storks, an endangered wading bird native to Southeast Asia, researchers warn.

“Apart from habitat loss and fragmentation, extinction through hybridization is one of the major threats to endangered species,” says research lead Frank Rheindt, an assistant professor in the biological sciences department at the National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Science.

“Our study is the first to provide an estimation of the population genomic status of the endangered Milky Stork in Singapore, and the findings can contribute to the design of effective solutions for conservation management of the globally endangered species.”

The Milky Stork, an almost completely white plumaged stork species, lives in coastal mangroves, mudflats, and estuaries across Southeast Asia. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List currently considers it endangered, with about 1,500 individuals left in the wild.

About seven to 10 percent of them live in the region around Singapore and Johor, Malaysia. Scientists believe the majority are related to those that escaped from captivity.

Kissing cousins

Since the late 1980s, Milky Storks (Mycteria cinerea) and their sister species, the Painted Storks (Mycteria leucocephala), have lived together in captivity in Singapore and Malaysia, which led to inadvertent crossbreeding or hybridization between the two species.

A black pectoral band and a pink flush in the inner wing coverts and tertials differentiates the Painted Stork from the Milky Stork. The hybridized storks display intermediacy in these traits.

“A few of these hybrids have escaped from captivity. Although some of these hybrid escapees have been recaptured, others continue to roam freely. This poses a major threat to the genomic composition of the Milky Stork population in the wild. However, the extent of this threat has not been clear,” says Pratibha Baveja, a PhD student in Rheindt’s research group and first author of the paper, which appears in Biological Conservation.

To find out how crossbreeding affects the gene pool of Milky Storks, researchers used population-genomic approaches to analyze the tissue samples of 46 storks from both captive and wild environments in Singapore.

The findings show significant genomic contamination of Painted Stork alleles in the Milky Storks’ genetic profile following crossbreeding for several generations. Although originating from a limited number of introduced Painted Storks, the hybrids are now an integral part of both the wild and captive Singaporean and southern peninsular Malaysian stork population.

Species in limbo

The research team determined that genetic infiltration from the Painted Stork affects the genomic composition of more than half of the sampled storks. The findings suggest that due to their very small populations, the genome of the more widespread species may eventually absorb the globally endangered species.

“Although native to the greater surroundings of Singapore, the current population of Milky Storks in Singapore is not only partially hybridized, but also thought to be derived from escaped birds. This has led to a situation in which the species is currently not even officially listed among Singapore’s native and introduced bird species, Rheindt says.

“This lack of formal recognition has left the species in limbo, but belies the importance of Singapore for the global survival of the species. The future is likely to see expansions of Milky Storks from the increasing Singaporean population into the diminishing Sumatran breeding grounds that form the species’ core.

“It will now be up to us here in Singapore to decide whether the core of the range will be re-stocked with pure Milky Storks or with hybrids. The challenge now lies in convincing the conservation community on the necessity of such conservation actions.”

To prevent crossbreeding, the researchers recommend identification and isolation of hybrid storks in bird parks, and zoos, from pure Milky Storks. Researchers can do genetic analysis to ensure individuals’ purity in any planned breeding programs or releases.

Further, researchers recommend strict removal of hybrids from the wild, along with a release of genetically pure Milky Storks, which are imperative for the continued survival of the species.

Researchers at Wildlife Reserves Singapore contributed to the study.

0,"Sweden reports ‘parrot disease’ outbreak

Swedish public health authorities, Folkhalsomyndigheten, is reporting (computer translated) an outbreak of psittacosis, or parrot disease, since November 2018.

According to officials, some 60 cases have been reported from the regions of Västra Götaland, Kalmar, Jönköping and Skåne. This is the highest number of cases reported in one winter in two decades.

Those who have now fallen ill have mainly come into contact with bird droppings from wild birds, for example through the handling of bird tables and other outdoor activities. A smaller number are believed to have been infected by domestic birds (parrots) in cages.

The most common way someone gets infected with the bacteria that cause psittacosis (Chlamydia psittaci) is by breathing in dust containing dried secretions (e.g., droppings, respiratory) from infected birds.

It is rare for psittacosis to spread from person to person.

In general, psittacosis causes mild illness in people. The most common symptoms include: Fever and chills, headache, muscle aches and dry cough.

Psittacosis can also cause pneumonia (a lung infection) that may require treatment or care in a hospital. Rarely, psittacosis can result in death.

Most people begin developing signs and symptoms of psittacosis within 5 to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria (C. psittaci). Occasionally, people report the start of symptoms after more than 14 days.",Sweden reports ‘parrot disease’ outbreak,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHA6Ly9vdXRicmVha25ld3N0b2RheS5jb20vc3dlZGVuLXJlcG9ydHMtcGFycm90LWRpc2Vhc2Utb3V0YnJlYWstNTY4ODYv0gFOaHR0cDovL291dGJyZWFrbmV3c3RvZGF5LmNvbS9zd2VkZW4tcmVwb3J0cy1wYXJyb3QtZGlzZWFzZS1vdXRicmVhay01Njg4Ni9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://outbreaknewstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/800px-Thick-billed_Parrot.jpg,2019-03-20,"{'sent': 'Sweden reports', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Sweden']}}","Sweden reports ‘parrot disease’ outbreak

Those who have now fallen ill have mainly come into contact with bird droppings from wild birds, for example through the handling of bird tables and other outdoor activities. A smaller number are believed to have been infected by domestic birds (parrots) in cages.

The most common way someone gets infected with the bacteria that cause psittacosis (Chlamydia psittaci) is by breathing in dust containing dried secretions (e.g., droppings, respiratory) from infected birds.

It is rare for psittacosis to spread from person to person.

In general, psittacosis causes mild illness in people. The most common symptoms include: Fever and chills, headache, muscle aches and dry cough.

Psittacosis can also cause pneumonia (a lung infection) that may require treatment or care in a hospital. Rarely, psittacosis can result in death.

Most people begin developing signs and symptoms of psittacosis within 5 to 14 days after exposure to the bacteria (C. psittaci). Occasionally, people report the start of symptoms after more than 14 days.","[{'Sweden', 'GPE'}, {'Swedish', 'NORP'}, {'ORG', 'Folkhalsomyndigheten'}, {'November 2018', 'DATE'}, {'CARDINAL', 'some 60'}, {'Västra Götaland', 'PERSON'}, {'PERSON', 'Kalmar'}, {'PERSON', 'Jönköping'}, {'Skåne', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'one winter'}, {'two decades', 'DATE'}, {'Chlamydia', 'ORG'}, {'DATE', '5 to 14 days'}, {'more than 14 days', 'DATE'}]","['Sweden', 'Swedish', 'Folkhalsomyndigheten', 'Skåne', 'Chlamydia']"

Bird lovers are being told to wing their way to Exmoor to see a new parrot complex.

Exmoor Zoo has finished building a parrot complex for rare and endangered species of parrots.

Endangered parrots on display range from one of the heaviest, most abundant and biggest macaws from South America, to tiny parakeets such as the grey-breasted conure.

A spokesperson for the zoo said: “The zoo has a good record with breeding different parrot species such as the yellow-shouldered Amazons which are exhibited in a family flock bred over the last eight years.

“The pair of Ochre-marked parakeets at the zoo since 2002 have bred over 50 progeny which have all gone into the genetic breeding program and are kept in zoos over Europe. More recently the zoo has bred Cuban Amazons for the first time.

“Many parrots such as the thick-billed parrot are no longer maintained in zoos, and they need the facility and chance to breed to maintain the captive population. Thick-billed parrots in the wild are another endangered species, and in northern Mexico, they are being bred at a special release centre so they can be released. Again, this is a species that Exmoor Zoo has successfully bred and we hope to help the breeding program with.

“Today fewer people keep parrots as pets, and it is down to the zoos and charities to preserve many species in safety away from the wild!”

Organised by illustrator Jenny Tang, the exhibition brings together more than 30 illustrators from the UK and beyond. Each artist chose an animal that's been badly affected by the loss or fragmentation of its natural habitat to illustrate, with the works printed on Tang's very own Risograph printer.

The printed works are then going on sale to raise funds for the World Land Trust's ""Buy An Acre"" scheme where every £100 donated means 1 acre of land will be preserved for wildlife.

""My main goals with this exhibition is to raise the profile of other illustrators, create awareness of the issues surrounding habitat loss and to raise funds for World Land Trust,"" says Tang. ""Each illustrated animal is risographed – an environmentally friendly printing technique using soy-based inks, and will range from the fierce tiger to the gentle pygmy three-toed sloth.""

She adds: ""‘On This Planet’ aims to create a positive, fun and accessible way for people to take part in environmentalism.""

Michelle Turton is one of the illustrators involved and chose to depict the Peruvian yellow-tailed woolly monkey. ""I'm half Peruvian so there's a connection there,"" she says. ""That's also one of the reasons I was drawn to getting involved in the show, as World Land Trust is working in Peru to protect areas of the Amazon rainforest.""

Steps taken to battle encroachment by sea caused by reduced flow, drop in silt

Dongying, where the Yel-low River flows into Bohai Bay in Shandong province, may be the fastest-growing city in the world.

Silt deposits from the river, in which 1 cubic meter of water can carry as much as 1.7 metric tons of the material, have increased the city's land area by 20 to 35 square kilometers annually.

The city's land and surrounding areas, which cover 6,000 to 7,000 sq km, were formed over the course of hundreds of millions of years from deposits carried by the Yellow River from the Loess Plateau, about 1,000 km away.

Yet the highly reduced levels of water and silt flowing in the river led to the sea encroaching on its estuary in the 1990s.

Zhu Shuyu, a wetland researcher at the Yellow River Delta Natural Reserve Administrative Bureau in Dongying, recalled the days when she arrived in the delta area after leaving college in 1993.

""In the mid-1990s, the river dried up for 100 days on average every year. This led to severe deterioration of the delta environment. Wetlands in the river estuary shrank by a large margin, and large numbers of birds and fish died,"" Zhu said.

Conditions started to change in 2002, when the Yellow River Conservancy Commission began to use the Xiaolangdi Hydro Power Project on the middle reaches of the river in Jiyuan county, Henan province, to regulate the river flow by storing floodwater to be released in drought seasons.

The project, which was completed in 2001, comprises a 12.65 billion-cubic-meter dam and a reservoir behind it.

Dykes were built in the river estuary wetland to conserve water, helping to restore surface runoff and supplementing groundwater supplies, enabling the gradual restoration of the wetland ecological system.

Since 2002, about 23,333 hectares of degraded wetland have been restored, the number of bird species living in the delta wetland has risen from 283 to 368 and the bird population has reached 3 million to 4 million.

""The Oriental white stork, a rare migratory bird species, did not breed in the delta before. Now they settle here. Since the first Oriental white stork came here in 2005, about 1,200 have been born in the delta wetland,"" Zhu said.

Guo Jiansan, a bird watcher from Dongying, said, ""Spring and autumn are the two seasons for bird lovers in Dongying, as millions of migratory birds pass through the Yellow River Delta wetland, providing us with a golden opportunity to observe them.""

Tourists from China and overseas make some 20 million trips to Dongying every year, and the wetland is a must-see spot on their itineraries. The Dongying city government estimates the wetland brings in about 17.6 billion yuan ($2.62 billion) in tourism revenue annually.

The water in the Yellow River also makes it possible for farmers to plant crops that generate more income.

Since 2002, Yang Shijian, a farmer in Luojiawuzi village on the river estuary, has planted rice on 187 hectares of land, which he sells to dozens of cities nationwide. He has increased his annual income from about 30,000 yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan.

Editor’s Note: In the ever-changing world of emergency and disaster management, there are countless challenges facing EDM professionals as they respond to natural and manmade events — some of which are interconnected. From intensified storms to droughts and devastating fires, those in the field have a deep understanding of how changing conditions pose new hazards and require innovative approaches to protecting the communities they serve.

Monday marks the 49th anniversary of the founding of Earth Day in 1970. EDM Digest is pleased to recognize Earth Day and honor the professionals who are continuously training and evolving their strategies to support preparedness.

The theme for Earth Day 2019 is “Protect Our Species,” which calls attention to the documented loss of 40 percent of the world’s wild animal population. Marine animals have been devastated. Turtles especially have been hard-hit by the destruction of their nesting grounds.

African Manatees, Bees, Insects and Sea Life Face Threat of Extinction

Also under threat of extinction is the African manatee. Similarly, bees and other insects responsible for pollinating the world's plant population are being decimated by insecticides and the mysterious colony collapse disorder that has killed millions of honey bees in recent years.

At the same time, climate change threatens almost 75% of the world's coral reefs, the habitat of many species of sea life.

Climate Changes Also Affecting Arctic Sea Ice

Since the late 1970s, ice in the Arctic Sea has shrunk on average about 21,000 square miles (54,000 square kilometers) annually. “That is equivalent to losing a chunk of sea ice the size of Maryland and New Jersey combined every year for the past four decades,” according to NASA’s Global Climate Change website.

Air Pollution Was Once Commonly Accepted as the Smell of Prosperity

At the time of the first Earth Day, air pollution was not considered a major environmental problem. Americans were guzzling leaded gasoline for their massive V8 sedans that were not equipped with emission control systems.

“Industry belched out smoke and sludge with little fear of legal consequences or bad press,” recalled the Earth Day Organization. “Air pollution was commonly accepted as the smell of prosperity. ‘Environment’ was a word that appeared more often in spelling bees than on the evening news.”

US Senator Credited with Earth Day Idea

Senator Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) is credited with the idea of a national day to focus on the environment. He had witnessed the 1969 massive oil spill off Santa Barbara, California, that released an estimated three million barrels of oil into the Pacific. The largest oil spill in the U.S. at the time, the slick killed thousands of birds, fish and sea mammals.

Nelson’s inspiration was the student anti-Vietnam war movement that was raging at the time. He “realized that if he could infuse that energy with an emerging public consciousness about air and water pollution, it would force environmental protection onto the national political agenda.” He chose April 22 as Earth Day because it coincided with students’ spring break, which would allow their greater participation in the historic enterprise.

As Nelson said in his founding Earth Day speech in 1970, “The battle to restore a proper relationship between man and his environment, between man and other living creatures, will require a long, sustained, political, rural, ethical and financial commitment far beyond any effort we ever made before in any enterprise in the history of man.”

Love Canal Contamination Prompted Creation of Federal Superfund Cleanup Program

If any further impetus was needed for an annual day devoted to securing the health of the planet, that day came eight years later at Love Canal in upstate New York, near Niagara Falls. The tiny community sat atop 21,000 tons of toxic industrial waste buried by a local company in the decades after World War II.

“Over the years, the waste began to bubble up into backyards and cellars. By 1978, the problem was unavoidable, and hundreds of families sold their houses to the federal government and evacuated the area,” Time magazine reported. Love Canal as a town ceased to exist. But the disaster led to the formation in 1980 of the federal Superfund program, which helps pay for the cleanup of toxic sites.

One of the goals of Earth Day is to end plastic pollution in the world’s waterways. The “exponential growth of plastics is now threatening the survival of our planet,” the Earth Day organization warns.

Iconic Polo Shirts to Be Made from Recycled Plastic Bottles

This week, Polo Ralph Lauren launched a version of its iconic polo shirt made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and dyed through a process that uses no water.

In announcing the Earth Polo, the company has committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. Earth Polo shirts will be manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each shirt uses an average of 12 recycled bottles.

“Every day we’re learning about what’s happened with global warming and what’s happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it’s time to step up and make a difference,” David Lauren, son of company founder Ralph Lauren, said in a statement.

The company’s other goals include use of 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100 percent recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year.

Thanks to events like Earth Day and imaginative uses of recycled materials, a growing number of citizens, governments and corporations are taking positive steps to stem and reverse the critical ecological losses of the past several decades.",Earth Day 2019 Raises Awareness of Endangered Species,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZWRtZGlnZXN0LmNvbS9yZXNvdXJjZXMvZWFydGgtZGF5LWVuZGFuZ2VyZWQtc3BlY2llcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://edmdigest.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/AdobeStock_44941714-earth-day.jpeg,2019-04-19,"{'sent': 'Start an Emergency & Disaster Management degree at American Military University.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['American Military University']}}","Start an Emergency & Disaster Management degree at American Military University.

One of the goals of Earth Day is to end plastic pollution in the world’s waterways. The “exponential growth of plastics is now threatening the survival of our planet,” the Earth Day organization warns.

Iconic Polo Shirts to Be Made from Recycled Plastic Bottles

This week, Polo Ralph Lauren launched a version of its iconic polo shirt made entirely of recycled plastic bottles and dyed through a process that uses no water.

In announcing the Earth Polo, the company has committed to removing at least 170 million bottles from landfills and oceans by 2025. Earth Polo shirts will be manufactured in Taiwan, where the bottles are collected. Each shirt uses an average of 12 recycled bottles.

“Every day we’re learning about what’s happened with global warming and what’s happening all around the world, and our employees and our customers are really feeling that it’s time to step up and make a difference,” David Lauren, son of company founder Ralph Lauren, said in a statement.

The company’s other goals include use of 100% sustainably sourced cotton by 2025 and 100 percent recyclable or sustainably sourced packaging materials by the same year.

Thanks to events like Earth Day and imaginative uses of recycled materials, a growing number of citizens, governments and corporations are taking positive steps to stem and reverse the critical ecological losses of the past several decades.","[{'ORG', 'an Emergency & Disaster Management'}, {'American Military University', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'David E.

""So I decided I wanted a chinchilla,"" said Isla. ""They were so cute. They are twin sisters born on New Year's Eve. We can tell them apart because one only has one eye, but she is still beautiful to us.""

Chinchillas are vegetarians and shouldn't drink tap water





However Isla cautions, chinchillas require a lot of care you may not realize. First, it's best for chinchillas to drink purified water, because they can be vulnerable to infections from tap water. Chinchillas are herbivores and require a steady diet of fresh Timothy hay and pellets.

Get ready to clean up a lot of poop

Here's something else you may not know.



""Chinchillas poop a lot. So you definitely need a vacuum,"" Isla said. ""We clean our cage every day.""

Temperature control



And when it comes to cages, make sure your chinchillas live somewhere cool. Chinchillas are native to the Andes Mountains and need to stay cooler than 74 degrees. Because of their tendency to overheat, putting them in hamster balls is dangerous and leaves them vulnerable to heat stroke. And wire-bottom cages are a no no. Chinchilla's delicate feet can get injured on the wires.

My, what long teeth you have

Also, don't forget dental care.



""It's so important to have wooden toys. Their teeth keep growing and growing and growing. If you don't give them chew toys such as chew sticks, their teeth will grow out of their mouth,"" Isla said.

Dust baths are key





While chinchillas are clean by nature, they do require dust baths. Their fur is so dense, they cannot get wet. Anastasia and Fantasia enjoy dust baths twice a week. They basically roll in volcanic ash and it's adorable.

The Wilderness Society's 'Australia's forest wildlife in crisis' report, released in March, revealed which unique animals are facing a dire future in the coming years.

The report stressed the failure of the Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) in balancing ecological sustainability with supplying resources to the industry.

The Regent Honeyeater, known for its striking yellow and black feathers, is ranked number seven on the Threatened Species Recovery Hubs' 20 Australian bird species most at risk of extinction in 20 years

The Western Ringtail Possum, from Western Australia, has jumped from 'vulnerable' to 'endangered' to 'critically endangered' since the WA RFA was signed

'Under current Federal laws and intergovernmental agreements these species are being pushed relentlessly and knowingly beyond declining population and shrinking distribution towards extinction,' the report said.

The Regent Honeyeater, known for its striking yellow and black feathers, is ranked number seven on the Threatened Species Recovery Hubs' 20 Australian bird species most at risk of extinction in 20 years and is listed critically endangered.

The bird, found in NSW, is understood to be threatened by the degradation of its habitat, with woodlands increasingly being cleared for agriculture and development, the report says.

The Western Ringtail Possum, from Western Australia, has jumped from 'vulnerable' to 'endangered' to 'critically endangered' since the WA RFA was signed.

The mammal, characterised with brown fur and a cream stomach, is ranked number 11 on the the 20 Australian mammal species.

The report found logging was to blame for the decline in numbers as the possum was more frequently found in unlogged forest or areas where logging had been less intense.

Number 13 on the list of bird species at risk is the Swift Parrot, which is found in NSW and Tasmania

Forestry operations and land clearing have led to the loss of breeding over the past 30 years

Forestry operations and land clearing have led to the loss of breeding over the past 30 years.

The Leadbeater's Possum, which are so tiny they can fit into the palm of your hand, are ranked number seven on the mammal's list.

Most people have never seen the nocturnal animal in the wild and in the past three decades their ecosystem has been pushed into further destruction.

They live in the Mountain Ash forests of the Central Highlands, Victoria, which continues to be harvested.

Among the list of Australian species, the Barred Galaxias (Vic) and Giant Freshwater Crayfish (Tas) are listed as vulnerable and endangered while the Koala (NSW/Vic) Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoo (WA) are vulnerable.

Ahead of the Federal Election on May 18, the Wilderness Society called on politicians to outline their policies in relation to animal extinction.

Suzanne Milthorpe, Wilderness Society National Nature Campaign Manager, said it was clear Australia was in an extinction crisis.

'We're number two in the world for species loss, and if we keep turning a blind eye to major threats to wildlife like deforestation, even iconic animals like the koala will go.'

Ms Milthorpe called for strong national environmental laws to stop the threats to the wildlife.

'With Australia losing three unique species in the last decade, and scientists expecting that number to skyrocket to 17 over the next 20 years, a key test for the next government will be turning around Australia's grim extinction record,' she said.

'Laws will not be enough—we need a new approach to protecting our environment.'

'Following six years of chaotic Coalition environment policy, Australia needs the leadership of a national Environment Commission to drive a national approach and ensure that Australia has world best-practice policy that supports our wildlife and natural places.'

Amid Australia's extinction crisis, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) revealed the nature's dangerous decline was 'unprecedented'.

The new report, released this week, warns the rate of species extinctions is accelerating and will have large implications for society.

'The overwhelming evidence of the IPBES Global Assessment, from a wide range of different fields of knowledge, presents an ominous picture,' said IPBES Chair, Sir Robert Watson.

'The health of ecosystems on which we and all other species depend is deteriorating more rapidly than ever. We are eroding the very foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide.'

Compiled by 145 expert authors from 50 countries over the past three years, the IPBES Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services is the most comprehensive ever completed.

The report found that about 1million animal and plant species are now threatened with extinction, many of them within the coming decades.

Since 1900, the average abundance of native species in most major land-based habitats has fallen by at least 20 per cent.

The report determines the drivers are changes in land and sea use, the direct exploitation of organisms, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species.

0,"Not all the animals at ZooAmerica North American Wildlife Park in Hershey eat every day. Snakes, for example, do not eat every day. But if every creature living at ZooAmerica did get their normal meat on the same day, the grocery list for just that one day would be quite varied.

Here is that list:

23.4 pounds of meat, some of it from trimmings off the prime cuts of meat prepared in the kitchens at Hotel Hershey. Most of the meat goes to the zoo’s carnivores, like the wolves and mountain lions, in the Big Sky, Northlands and Eastern Woodlands areas of the zoo.

11.41 pounds of frozen mice.

5.3 pounds of quail, which regularly are fed to the peregrine falcons, but also to the wolves and mountain lions, “just for something to change up their diets,” explained Theresa Wilson, education specialist at ZooAmerica.

7.54 pounds of fruits and vegetables.

2.2 pounds of greens, some of it from trimmings in the kitchens at Hotel Hershey.

Frozen food items are maintained at about a 2-month level, while enough fresh produce might be on hand for 2 weeks.

Supplements are added to the food for some of the animals. Reptical and Reptivite are added to the reptiles’ food at least once a week, providing them with extra minerals and a balance in their calcium and phosphorus levels. Skunks, when they’re shedding, are given vitamin E capsules concealed in their food. Tortoises get cod liver oil on their food. Elderly animals receive supplements prescribed by veterinarians for conditions like arthritis.

The amount of food provided to the animals is carefully monitored.

“We weigh all of our diets, in and out,” explained Wilson. In combination with other indicators, it gives “a rough idea if somebody is not eating enough.”

When there are multiple animals in an enclosure that would compete for the food, zookeepers dole that food out in multiple bowls.

Feeding times vary at ZooAmerica. Many of the carnivores are fed at night in their dens. Many of the animals in the Great Southwest are fed first thing in the morning.

The timing is also dictated by the zookeepers’ ability to clean the enclosures, give first-rate care to the animals and provide an exciting, educational experience to zoo visitors.

Reptiles are some of the most difficult animals to feed, said Wilson. When reptiles are eating regularly, they often are less motivated by food.

“Most of our carnivores are pretty willing to eat, except in the summer,” she added. “Summer can be a bit more dicey for their appetites, but reptiles are more eager for food in the summer.”

Among the most complex diets at the zoo is prepared for the thick-billed parrots, which are part of an international conservation program for endangered species.

ZooAmerica is home to 7 of the parrots, in cooperation with the Species Survival Plan coordinated by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The birds were selected and paired to provide the best genetic representation in offspring hatched in captivity. The AZA and SSP are working to protect the thick-billed parrot habitat in Mexico, where several parrots reside.

ZooAmerica has had success with thick-billed parrot breeding over the years. Eggs have hatched in 2001, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The zoo’s current and most prolific breeding pair may now be past breeding age. Sunny, the male that fathered chicks from 2011-2015, became the oldest breeding male in 2015 at age 28. The zoo keeps the chicks until they are at least 5 years old, when they are then sent to other zoos to breed, based on recommendations from the SSP.

The zoo in Hershey also participates in research projects to learn more about thick-billed parrots. With so few birds remaining, every bit of knowledge gained is vital to the cause of saving their species.

Pine nuts, which are relatively expensive, are one of the primary foods for thick-billed parrots in their native pine forests. ZooAmerica feeds them some pine nuts, but mixes those with other nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables.

Animals at ZooAmerica also receive food as part of the zoo’s enrichment effort. (I covered enrichments in detail in Here’s how treats help otters, wolves, armadillos and other animals at ZooAmerica.)

Animals in zoos like ZooAmerica are led away from boredom and into mind-challenging, body-moving activities through little additions to their daily routines known as enrichments.

Also known as enrichment activities, environmental enrichments and behavioral enrichments, the species appropriate additions range from food items presented in a challenging way to scents to new environmental textures.

As the sun sets, a perplexing array of sounds waft over the gently sloping meadow of our campsite. As well as the chaffinch’s call, there’s a curious tap-tap-tapping; beyond, a bird with a sore throat is imitating a donkey; then there’s a hoot, a laugh and a furious chattering argument.

After two nights, we identify the noises. The tap-tapping is wild red squirrels, which open wooden feeders on the old oaks around us. The “donkey” is a white-naped crane, the hoot is a howler monkey, and the arguments are between the lemurs that curl their tails around the trees just beyond our tent.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Broad canvas … the yurts at Jersey Zoo’s glampsite

When we (my wife Lisa, twins Milly and Esme, 7, and Ted, 5) arrive at Durrell Wildlife Camp, a glamping site based right beside the lush parkland of Jersey Zoo, we are warned that lemurs will wake us every morning. They don’t: we sleep incredibly soundly, spellbound by intense days spent unusually close to other animals and calm evenings sleeping together beside the woodburner inside our yurt.

A zoo holiday is an easy sell to my wildlife-loving children. But, to be honest, I’d visited Jersey once before and wasn’t a fan. There’s its reputation for rich tax exiles, while its maze of lanes – like spaghetti, according to one local – seemed claustrophobic. I’m ambivalent about zoos, too, and don’t believe that large, roaming animals, such as elephants, should be kept in such small spaces.

But I was wrong about Jersey, and its zoo does exactly what Gerald Durrell declared it must when he founded it 60 years ago: it is dedicated to “saving species from extinction”.

Unexpectedly, the island’s west coast feels like Australia, with its thundering surf, glittering light and vast beaches, and is home to unspoiled coves such as Beau Port and Portelet Bay. On the more desolate north coast, I spy the acrobatic choughs – the beautiful “sea crows” which vanished from the Channel Islands a century ago but have been reintroduced by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, the charity that co-ordinates Jersey Zoo’s captive-breeding work to support endangered species around the world.

When we arrive at the zoo, it immediately feels homely, perhaps because it still is a home, and there’s a sense that the staff are a close-knit family. Gerald Durrell died in 1995 but his widow, Lee, still lives here, alongside other conservationists working for Durrell’s charity. Durrell is remembered for his jolly stories but he was also a conservation visionary who revolutionised the western concept of a zoo, demanding that they become arks for wildlife.

His legacy is visible on our first evening, when we watch some of the young scientists studying in the zoo’s conservation academy enjoying a kick-about on the grass outside the campsite. Durrell’s academy has trained more than 4,000 conservationists from 141 countries (and I can confirm that Brazilian conservation scientists possess the best footballing skills).

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Stumpy and Tigger, the zoo’s ring-tailed lemurs

These young conservationists are as chatty and idealistic as zoo employee Will Highfield, who takes us on a dusk tour (a perk of zoo camp life) after the day visitors have departed. Will worked in financial services – as do many young Jersey islanders – before volunteering and then taking a job at the zoo. Later this year he is running a marathon in a gorilla suit to raise money for gorilla conservation.

Having this garden-like zoo to ourselves at a time of day when many animals, such as the amazing fruit bats, become more active, is magical. Most western zoos now have “enriched” habitats with plenty of natural vegetation, but Jersey’s enclosures are particularly generous. Tamarin monkeys live uncaged in natural woodland. Lemurs climb high in ancient oaks and sycamores. And there’s also a preponderance of what Durrell called “little brown jobs”. He believed we were as much obliged to save from extinction the mountain chicken (a large, shy and rather plain-looking frog) and the (actually quite grey) pink pigeon as we are lions and tigers. And so his zoo continues to breed the two former species for conservation programmes, and doesn’t keep the latter.

Staying at the campsite gives us free access to the zoo, and we easily fill three days there. This solves the sensory overload problem posed by a day trip, when children rush from animal to animal without experiencing any true connection with another species. As they keep returning, my children slow down, and develop relationships with their favourite animals. We book in for extra “experiences” – meeting lemurs and feeding meerkats, otters and orangutans. Meeting the orangutans is a particularly emotional encounter: our endangered near-relatives most sharply prick our consciences about the extinction crisis.

I’m struck by how this zoo holiday helps fulfil what US naturalist EO Wilson called biophilia – our craving for a deep connection with other species. Milly adores feeding camellia flowers to the lemurs, Ted loves the jewel-like blue poison frogs and, in the butterfly house, Esme is as authoritative as a miniature keeper, licking her finger and expertly tempting butterflies on to it, feeling that joy that comes from bonding with another member of our amazing planet.

How could a female lay a fertile egg without a mate? They turned to the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute (SCBI) for an answer to the mystery: parthenogenesis.

What exactly is parthenogenesis?

Miller: Female Asian water dragons can reproduce sexually or asexually—with or without a male. This is called facultative parthenogenesis, and it comes in handy when an animal is trying to repopulate an area and cannot find a mate.

How exciting is it to be the first to confirm parthenogenesis in Asian water dragons?

Miller: While biologists have documented cases of parthenogenesis in other species of Squamate reptiles (snakes and lizards), the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s Asian water dragon hatchling is the first-known case of parthenogenesis in this species.

What exactly is parthenogenesis?

Miller: Female Asian water dragons can reproduce sexually or asexually—with or without a male. This is called facultative parthenogenesis, and it comes in handy when an animal is trying to repopulate an area and cannot find a mate.

How exciting is it to be the first to confirm parthenogenesis in Asian water dragons?

Miller: While biologists have documented cases of parthenogenesis in other species of Squamate reptiles (snakes and lizards), the Smithsonian’s National Zoo’s Asian water dragon hatchling is the first-known case of parthenogenesis in this species. These scientific discoveries are always very exciting, and having the opportunity to confirm parthenogenesis at all is really cool!","[{'DATE', 'four years'}, {'the Reptile Discovery Center’s', 'ORG'}, {'Asian', 'NORP'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'ORG'}, {'Reptile Discovery Center', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Kyle Miller'}, {'SCBI’s Center for Conservation Genomics', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Rob Fleischer'}, {'DATE', 'June 5, 2019'}, {'PLOS', 'ORG'}, {'CARDINAL', 'ONE'}, {'Asian', 'NORP'}, {'Physignathus', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Miller'}, {'Asian', 'NORP'}, {'DATE', 'asexually'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}, {'Asian', 'NORP'}, {'PERSON', 'Miller'}, {'Squamate', 'ORG'}, {'Smithsonian', 'ORG'}, {'National Zoo’s', 'ORG'}, {'Asian', 'NORP'}, {'ORDINAL', 'first'}]","['the Reptile Discovery Center’s', 'Asian', 'the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute', 'Reptile Discovery Center', 'SCBI’s Center for Conservation Genomics', 'PLOS', 'Asian', 'Physignathus', 'Asian', 'Asian', 'Squamate', 'Smithsonian', 'National Zoo’s', 'Asian']"
0,"The Virgin Islands are under threat from a number of invasive species, but there are ways you can help.

The Virgin Islands are a biodiverse group of islands and islets within the Caribbean that host a plethora of seabirds and boast spectacular coral reef habitat. Protecting these ecosystems is integral and they are under threat from a myriad of invasive species including feral cats, goats, and rats.

One of the most notable species is the Magnificent Frigate bird of which a colony is currently being protected and managed within the Great Tobago National Park by the National Parks Trust of the Virgin Islands. The well-being of this species is currently threatened by the presence of feral goats, which the National Parks Trust are actively working to remove. Feral goats were introduced by European settlers and in conjunction with their harm to native bird colonies, they also pose a threat to rare, native plants, through overgrazing and have an adverse effect on sensitive coral reef habitats due to increased sedimentation.

The introduction of feral and outdoor cats is another tremendous stressor on wildlife on the islands. When left outside, they kill millions of wild birds each year and threaten lizards, frogs, and the Critically Endangered Anegada Rock Iguana. This is just one of many reasons why keeping domestic cats indoors is so beneficial to wildlife.

Invasive rats are also a source of harm and have proliferated across the Virgin Islands; originally introduced as stowaways on ships. They may be small, but their impacts on native wildlife and plants is anything but. They spread disease and have caused extinctions of a number of island species. When traveling to the islands, or anywhere that is suffering from the effects of invasive rats, storing food in rat-proof containers to avoid spreading the invasive rats to new locations is crucial. Always check your belongings while traveling to ensure an invasive rat is not hitching a free ride by boat.

0,"What images come to mind when you hear the words “African safari”? Sitting in the bush on a moonlit night, so close to a lion that you can feel the rumble of its roar in your chest?

Many travelers might conjure up visions of tented camps, gourmet meals under a baobab tree, game drives through golden savanna, and sundowners at the end of the day. But safaris can also involve self-guided rental cars, game walks, and fly-fishing. Safaris can be as varied as the continent of Africa itself.

One recent trend: expeditions that enlist travelers in the fight to save endangered wildlife. Tourists make a difference by joining rhino or lion conservationists at work in South Africa or accompanying researchers working on a chimpanzee habituation project in Kibale National Park in Uganda. (Read about the dark truth behind wildlife tourism.)

No matter where you go and what type of safari you choose, timing is key. Once you’ve narrowed your options, look into the best time to visit. South Africa’s summer (December through February), for example, is prime safari season in that region. You’ll still see wildlife if you go during South Africa’s winter (June through August), but pack a jacket, as temperatures can be chilly, especially before the sun rises.

Set off into the wild and see the world like never before with our guide to top safari experiences in 11 African countries.

South Africa

Kruger National Park: South Africa’s largest game reserve, Kruger National Park makes a perfect home base for self-guided and first-time safaris. Stay in one of the park’s fenced camps, such as the Crocodile Bridge Rest Camp on the northern bank of the Crocodile River. Head into the bush early to explore the Southern Circle, famous for its competing lion prides and their varied hunting practices. Don’t miss the nearby hippo pool, but be sure to stay in your car outside of the camp. (Take a solo safari through South Africa’s wild grasslands.)

Hazyview: Not far from Kruger’s southwestern Phabeni Gate, Hazyview is a family-friendly hub for horseback safaris, zip-lining, safari golf, and trout fishing. Check in to one of the lodges, such as Hippo Hollow Country Estate, and then head out into the Kruger before sunrise on a self-guided game drive to scout lions and white rhinos. Break for lunch in the town of Skukuza.

Timbavati Private Nature Reserve: The rugged Timbavati is one of the private nature reserves that make up the greater Kruger area. Guests can choose from eight lodges there. An upscale chalet at fence-free Simbavati Safari Lodges, for example, is perfect for families. Wake up early for game drives, perhaps to search for African wild dogs. Mid-morning, kids head into the bush for a scavenger hunt with a guide.

Grootbos Private Nature Reserve: Animals aren’t the only sights to track on safari. In South Africa’s Western Cape region, wildflowers provide the dazzle. The two lodges at Grootbos, part of the National Geographic Unique Lodges of the World, sit amid the smallest of the world’s six floral kingdoms, home to some 800 plant species. Watch for sharks and southern right whales from your suite’s deck. (See the world’s best places for flowers.)

Swaziland

Hlane Royal National Park: Head to Swaziland, a country landlocked between South Africa and Mozambique, to see Hlane’s fiercely protected rhinos and marabou storks. Stay in one of the park’s two lodges, Ndlovu Camp or Bhubesi, and enjoy self-guided drives on the safe game-viewing roads that crisscross the park’s flat terrain. Spot lions, hyenas, giraffes, and vulturess, then picnic at the Mahlindza water hole.

Botswana

Central Kalahari Game Reserve: Black-maned Kalahari lions roam this reserve in central Botswana. Stay just north of the reserve at Deception Valley Lodge, where you can watch magical sunsets dip into the horizon from the deck of your chalet.

Zimbabwe

Hwange National Park: All aboard the Elephant Express to tour the Ngamo Forest Area and Hwange National Park, known for its pachyderms and 400-plus species of birds. The two-hour safari rail trip is easily accessible to Imvelo Safari Lodges’ Bomani Tented Lodge or Camelthorn Lodge. Check out the game-viewing underground hide at nearby Stoffie’s Pan. North from Hwange, a four-hour drive or a one-hour flight gets you to regal Victoria Falls, a thundering natural wonder you can hear long before you first catch sight of it.

Mana Pools National Park: Try a river-based safari in a kayak at this remote park. The best time to go may be in April, when large herds of elephants, buffalo, kudu, and the elusive eland return to the four (or mana in the local language) large permanent pools along the south bank of the Zambezi River after the rainy season. Accommodations in the park include lodges, thatched chalets, and campsites.

Namibia

Namib Desert: A safari here means brilliant stargazing, silky sand, age-old views, and resilient desert animals such as oryx, bat-eared foxes, Burchell’s zebras, and loads of lizards. Stay at &Beyond’s Sossusvlei Desert Lodge, located at the desert’s eastern edge. Explore the Namib dunes on a quad bike, and hike a craggy slope to see ancient rock paintings in a nearby cave, making sure to pack water, a hat, and sunscreen. (See eerie photos of a Namibian ghost town.)

Mozambique

Gorongosa National Park: Located in central Mozambique, Gorongosa has been brought back to life after suffering the devastations of many years of civil conflict. Today, when you visit, you become a part of one of Africa’s most successful wildlife restoration stories. Home to floodplains and preserved palm forests, Gorongosa has an amazing diversity of wildlife, from antelope to primates and huge Nile crocodiles, as well as lions, elephants, and hippos.

Tanzania

Selous Game Reserve: Visit this off-the-beaten-track and tranquil reserve in southern Tanzania for walking safaris and traditional game drives. Then cruise the Rufiji River to watch for elephants, hippos, lions, leopards, and brindled gnu. Stay at Beho Beho, a hilltop lodge that also has secluded tree-house accommodations for the extra adventurous.

Serengeti National Park: At Asilia’s Namiri Plains camp in northern Tanzania, visitors become part of the migration as they travel in a luxury mobile camp alongside herds of wildebeests, zebras, and gazelles. Walking safaris get you closer to the action, with veteran Serengeti safari guides giving the play-by-play. The animals—often stalked by big predators, such as lions and cheetahs—follow one of Earth’s most ancient routes. And if you come too close to an animal, never run. Move away quietly.

Kenya

Olare Motorogi Conservancy: Cross the border from Tanzania into southern Kenya for an iconic East African lodge experience at the Mara Plains Camp. About a 2.5-hour drive from the legendary Masai Mara National Reserve, the eco-friendly camp was built by National Geographic Explorers-in-Residence Dereck and Beverly Joubert with their partners at Great Plains Conservation. From camp, you’ll head out on safari to watch migrating zebras and wildebeests make exciting and risky river crossings. You may even see a few big cats. (Experience an air safari through Kenya.)

Ragati Conservancy: Kenya may be a great place to see the migrations, but it’s also a surprisingly fantastic spot for fly-fishing. On the southern slopes of Mount Kenya (Africa’s second highest peak), the Ragati Conservancy has mountain streams stocked with glistening rainbow trout. What makes the Ragati worth the trip? Nat Geo photographer and fly fisherman Pete Muller says that while Idaho fishing is amazing, “anglers won’t encounter an elephant along the Lochsa!” Fishing in Kenya, he says, also gives fishing enthusiasts the chance to visit locations such as Aberdare National Park.

Rwanda/Uganda

Volcanoes National Park/kalinzu Forest Reserve: Rwanda’s Volcanoes National Park allows a limited number of visitors per day to hike into the jungle to view endangered mountain gorillas up close, as they groom each other, play, and eat bamboo shoots and fruits. Keep your eyes open for golden monkeys too. Nat Geo Expeditions offers an itinerary that includes a gorilla trek, then heads north into Uganda for a chimpanzee trek through the lush Kalinzu Forest Reserve near Queen Elizabeth National Park. (Here’s how to visit the endangered mountain gorillas of Uganda and Rwanda.)

Chad

Zakouma National Park: Intense wildlife experiences await at this park known for the number of animals that make it their home. A herd of more than 500 elephants and flocks of birds, such as the black-crowned crane, in the tens of thousands, congregate here. Zakouma had a tremendous comeback after enduring civil unrest in the region.

Sometimes you're visiting a new U.S. city — let's say you're in San Francisco — and you see a bunch of red and green parrots just hanging out in the trees. That's exciting! They sure are beautiful and exotic! But your gut tells you they don't necessarily belong there. Your gut is right, because both parrot species native to the United States were hunted to extinction in the ""land of the free"" long ago: the Carolina parakeet (Conuropsis carolinensis) was gone by 1918 and the thick-billed parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) was extirpated from the southwestern states by the 1930s, though you can still find it alive and well in Mexico.

So, for future reference, you can be sure that any wild parrots you see in San Francisco, Miami, New York, Chicago, Austin, or any number of other U.S. cities are not native. But how did they get there?

Each city has its own story, of course, but San Francisco's flock is a bit of a mystery. They are mainly cherry-headed conures (Psittacara erythrogenys), a mid-sized parrot species named for its bright red helmet sitting atop its green body. These birds are native to Ecuador and Peru, but showed up in San Francisco's Telegraph Hill neighborhood in the 1980s. From a population of only four birds, it's grown to more than 200. Over the years, the Telegraph Hill parrots have probably been joined by other released cherry-headed conures and a few similar-looking mitred conures (Psittacara mitratus), native to the area between Peru and Argentina.

The short answer to the question of what brought the parrots to Telegraph Hill is the exotic pet trade. Nobody knows who released them or why, but many of the original birds arrived with little bracelets on their legs, indicating they were captured in the wild and came to the U.S. through quarantine stations. There are plenty of local legends as to how they were released in the city: A woman having a psychotic episode burned down a pet store and someone released the birds in order to save them; a pet store delivery truck crashed and all the birds escaped; an exotic bird dealer opened the back of his van and some cherry-headed conures that had chewed through their boxes burst out at him and flew away. There are problems with all these stories — the timing isn't right, the people supposedly involved deny it, or the story did happen, just in a different city.

According to the pet website Birdguide.com, ""The cherry-headed conure is a very loud bird that can easily develop screaming habits if not curbed by its owner.""

Seems like the most likely scenario is that the parrots of Telegraph Hill were released by fed-up pet owners.

Now That's Interesting In the 1890s a man named Eugene Schieffelin introduced 100 European starlings to New York City with the intention of introducing every bird mentioned by Shakespeare to North America. Their numbers have grown to over 200 million and they are now considered pests in their new home.

0,"travel, fiji, luxury, resort, crested, iguana

It's hard to believe the first Fijian crested iguana to be sighted on Malolo Island in close to 30 years literally fell out of a tree at a luxury resort. Was it curiosity that finally lured it out of its hiding place? Or could it have been an understandable desire to stay in one of Fiji's only over-water villas? Fires and rampant agricultural clearing had wiped out most of the treetop dweller's dry forest habitat, with only small, isolated pockets remaining on the island. One of those bordered the adults-only Likuliku Lagoon Resort, where a surprised groundskeeper spotted the never-before-seen iguana behind one of its lavish beachside villas. Fearfully, he picked up the closest object he could find and hurled it at the beast, leaving it teetering on the edge of survival. ''He was worried that it would grow big and become a dinosaur,'' says Sialisi Rasalato, group environment manager for Ahura Resorts, which owns Likuliku and its family-friendly neighbour, Malolo Island Resort. The incident was reported to Steve Anstey, Ahura Resorts' group general manager, who told a staff member to accompany the herbivorous lizard to the main island so it could be identified and undergo veterinary care. As luck would have it, one of the world's foremost iguana experts, San Diego Zoo's Dr Robert Fischer, and Dr Peter Harlow from Taronga Zoo, happened to be there when the iguana arrived. Although the reptile died shortly after, Fischer sent a tissue sample to the US for DNA testing, which confirmed that a subspecies thought to be extinct had been rediscovered. The timing of this event was October 13, 2010 - a pivotal date in Likuliku's (and the Malolo Island crested iguana's) history, for it set in motion conservation efforts never before seen in this part of the Pacific, in turn leading to the resort's accreditation as one of National Geographic's Unique Lodges of the World. On the advice of Fischer and Harlow, the resort implemented non-native animal eradication and habitat restoration programs aimed at ensuring the survival of one of the world's rarest creatures. Bait stations were laid and cage traps set to snare feral rats and cats. Invasive plant species were removed. And a native plant nursery was established in 2012. Further iguana sightings occurred sporadically during the months and years that followed. A juvenile male was captured near Malolo Island Resort in January 2011. A female was caught at Likuliku later that year. One was found in 2013. Then, in June 2015, six iguanas were tagged. ''That illustrated to us that the invasive species control was working,'' says Rasalato. That realisation sparked a flurry of activity. Likuliku sponsored a three-month internship for a PhD student from the University of Georgia to conduct night surveys, when iguanas are more easily spotted, and to consolidate data relating to the Malolo Island crested iguana. New iguana populations were documented, with more than half found to be juveniles - a sign that conditions were improving. Likuliku started its own captive breeding program next, and Rasalato was recruited as Fiji's first resort-based environmental officer in January 2017. In August that year, Likuliku's first two iguanas hatched naturally - a world first in captivity. ''In January 2019, the population on the whole island totalled 67, including ours,'' Rasalato says, proudly. The resort's 11 iguanas - four breeding pairs, plus seven hatchlings that will be released into the wild once they've matured - are housed inside airy, purpose-built enclosures limiting the threat of wildlife-smuggling through 24-hour camera surveillance. Malolo, the original juvenile male found in January 2011, is still there, spreading his gene pool and acting as his species' ambassador during thrice-weekly educational presentations where he'll often scramble up guest's arms or perch on their head. ''We're now getting guests coming to stay because they want to see the iguanas,'' says Anstey - proof that a purely ethical decision aimed at preserving a species can be a sound financial investment as well. FLY: Fiji Airways, Qantas, Jetstar and Virgin Australia all fly direct to Fiji's Nadi International Airport from east coast hubs. Transfer to Likuliku Lagoon Resort by fast catamaran, private speedboat, seaplane or helicopter. STAY: Likuliku Lagoon Resort's rooms cost from $1300 a night for two adults. Fijian Crested Iguana Experiences are included, as well as meals, welcome refreshments, free Wi-Fi and complimentary use of non-motorised water sports equipment.

0,"TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - Jakarta Birdwatcher Society (JBS) announced there are 129 species of birds wildly living in green spaces (RTH) across the capital city.

“We have recorded 129 bird species in 19 RTH in Jakarta. Six of which are endangered species,” said the group coordinator Ady Kristanto in Jakarta, Monday, July 22.

The six endemic species are Javan lathe (Centropus nigrorufus), white starlings (Sturnus melanopterus), Javanese kettle (Charadrius javanicus), Christmas frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi), milky stork (Mycteria cinerea), and Asian darter (Anhinga melanogaster).

Those species were seen in 19 open green areas: Muara Angke wildlife reserve, Ragunan Zoo, Srengseng City Forest, Angke Kapuk protected forest, Menteng, Kebayoran, Angke Kapuk Natural Park; Cibubur Buperta (camping ground), Kemayoran City Forest, Monas area, Ragunan Buperta (camping ground), Tebet, Ancol, Kali Pesanggrahan, Manggala Wanabakti, Senayan, Ciliwung, UI City Forest, and Situ Babakan.

In addition to local species, JBS also recorded several species of migratory birds in the city’s open spaces during a migration period, namely Asian honey buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus), Japanese Sparrowhawk (Accipiter gularis), Chinese Goshawk (Accipiter soloensis) that are a kind of birds of prey.

Moreover, there are also migratory birds along the coastal areas of Jakarta, such as Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis vulva) and Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus).

“Although Jakarta’s green spaces are not reached 30 percent or around 9.8 percent of total city’s area, the capital still becomes the transit place of migratory birds,” he said.

Ady then reminded the government to put serious concerns to preserve the ecosystem sustainability, especially in West Jakarta that has the least area of green space.

“We have recorded 129 bird species in 19 RTH in Jakarta. Six of which are endangered species,” said the group coordinator Ady Kristanto in Jakarta, Monday, July 22.

The six endemic species are Javan lathe (Centropus nigrorufus), white starlings (Sturnus melanopterus), Javanese kettle (Charadrius javanicus), Christmas frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi), milky stork (Mycteria cinerea), and Asian darter (Anhinga melanogaster).

Those species were seen in 19 open green areas: Muara Angke wildlife reserve, Ragunan Zoo, Srengseng City Forest, Angke Kapuk protected forest, Menteng, Kebayoran, Angke Kapuk Natural Park; Cibubur Buperta (camping ground), Kemayoran City Forest, Monas area, Ragunan Buperta (camping ground), Tebet, Ancol, Kali Pesanggrahan, Manggala Wanabakti, Senayan, Ciliwung, UI City Forest, and Situ Babakan.

In addition to local species, JBS also recorded several species of migratory birds in the city’s open spaces during a migration period, namely Asian honey buzzard (Pernis ptilorhynchus), Japanese Sparrowhawk (Accipiter gularis), Chinese Goshawk (Accipiter soloensis) that are a kind of birds of prey.

Moreover, there are also migratory birds along the coastal areas of Jakarta, such as Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis vulva) and Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus).

0,"IT was 7am when Wahab Tamati was preparing some food and buckets to gather the eggs of maleo (Macrocephalon maleo) birds in the forest of Hungayono, Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park, in Bone Bolango regency, Gorontalo. “I have to reach the nests of maleo before 10 in the morning because the birds only lay eggs from 6am to 10am,” Wahab told Tempo on Wednesday, July 24.

The 49-year-old man is a resident of Tulabulo village, East Suwawa subdistrict, Bone Bolango, in charge of hatching maleo eggs in the maleo bird population sanctuary of Hungayono. Every day he enters the forest in the Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park (TNBNW) zone in Bone Bolango to find and collect maleo eggs. On that day he obtained five eggs the size of his fist.

Wahab has collected the maleo egg since 2004, for the reason of being concerned over the widespread hunting of maleo eggs by people for consumption. At present, he is capable of gathering five to seven eggs daily or 100-150 eggs monthly. He even once managed to obtain 200 maleo eggs in a month. Wahab claimed it took only two to three hours for him to collect eggs. The search for the eggs is not so hard either because maleo birds always lay eggs in the same places.

One difficulty in gathering maleo eggs, in Wahab’s experience, is only the digging of sandy soil due to the use of empty hands. The earth to be dug to find one maleo egg can be as deep as the waist of an adult. The maleo eggs already found are then taken to a hatchery. “The eggs should be laid in buckets carefully. The pointed parts of the eggs should be at the bottom,” said Wahab.

The hatchery managed by Wahab is not far from the hot water spring of Hungayono. The place is not more than 150 square meters with a height of two meters. It has a zinc roof with iron louvers and its ceiling uses nylon nets. On its sand floor for hatching, small holes are created into which eggs are put. The holes are arranged at intervals of two spans of adult fingers. The depths of the holes are 30 to 40 centimeters. The holes already filled with eggs are covered with sand and marked with bamboo sticks.

Maleo Senkawor ( Macrocephalon maleo)

» Characteristics: Dominant black feathers, whitish pink lower-body side feathers, a hard crest at the top of the head

» Length: 55 centimeters

» Eggs: The size of an adult fist

» Conservation status: Endangered (International Union for Conservation of Nature)

» Population estimate: 15,000 birds

According to Wahab, one hatchery usually can accommodate 150 eggs. Four other hatcheries have been built. The total of hatching holes has reached over 2,000. In a year, the maleo egg hatcheries in Hungayono have a capacity of hatching more than 2,000 eggs. The eggs that hatch mostly come from those collected in the hot water area of Hungayono.

For the hatching of one maleo egg, Wahab claimed to have needed 60 days with soil temperatures ranging from 30 to 33 degrees Celsius. Newborn maleo chicks will emerge from the ground very slowly. It takes two days for the chicks to dig the sand until they appear on the surface. Then they will abandon the holes by scurrying to hatchery corners. Normally, the chicks will promptly be released into the wild. “In this location there are always eggs hatching every day and also chicks being released every day,” said Wahab.

Maleo birds endemic to Sulawesi are terrestrial and the only bird species of genus Macrocephalon with a length of 55 centimeters. They have such characteristics as black feathers, yellow skin around their eyes, brownish red irises, gray legs, orange beaks and whitish pink lower-body side feathers. At the top of their heads are black horns or hard crests.

Previously, the population of maleo sharply decreased so that the International Union for Conservation of Nature put it on the endangered list. Maleo was also included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Indonesian government declared maleo a protected wildlife species based on the Law on the Conservation of Biological Natural Resources and their Ecosystem and Government Regulation No. 7/1999.

Bagus Tri Nugroho, Chief of the Gorontalo Region I National Park Management Section of the TNBNW, said 15 years ago maleo birds were very hard to find. “The biggest threat to maleo is actually egg hunting by men. Many people are hunting maleo eggs for consumption,” said Bagus.

Maleo birds in fact have high security intelligence. They will usually learn the security situation of their egg-laying places from trees. Male birds will dig holes for their female mates to lay eggs. After eggs are laid, they make other holes to disguise them from predators. Maleo birds are sensitive to sounds. Noisiness within a radius of 5-10 meters can make them fly to tree branches. “Maleo birds are very sensitive to all kinds of activity around their habitat,” added Bagus.

Based on TNBNW data, the maleo population is predicted to increase in the last decade. Until June 2019, the maleo population was estimated to reach 17,270 birds from the previous number of only 6,000 in 2007. The population increase is calculated from the number of maleo chicks released after hatching and the total of eggs collected.

Supriyanto, Chief of the TNBNW Center, said five locations had served as maleo bird population sanctuaries in Gorontalo. Besides Hungayono, there are Tambun, Muara Pusian, Pohulongo and Batu Manangis maleo sanctuaries. The five places are known as maleo egg-laying nests due to their proximity to the natural hot water area. “So far thousands of eggs have been hatched from the five locations. From Hungayono alone in 2018, 2,700 maleo chicks were released,” said Supriyanto.

The success of the Hungayono maleo sanctuary, said Supriyanto, was inseparable from the role and participation of village people who hatch maleo eggs independently. Today at least six villages on the fringes of the TNBNW zone have become independent maleo egg guardians and conservationists. “Residents of the six villages have also agreed to safeguard the conservation endeavor and participate in the restoration of the ecosystem independently,” said Supriyanto.

The TNBNW with a total area of 282,008.757 hectares is the largest land national park in Sulawesi. The conservation zone established as a national park in 1992 covers two regions: Bone Bolango regency, Gorontalo province, with an area of 110,000 hectares, and Bolaang Mongondow regency, North Sulawesi province, with over 170,000 hectares. The TNBNW is an important habitat of typical species of Sulawesi, among others lowland anoa (Bubalus depressicornis), kuskus or Sulawesi bear (Ailurops ursinus), yaki (Macaca nigra) and maleo.",Safeguarding Maleo in Bone Bolango,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEHLp60ooPP1d2ueBiN7b7PkqGQgEKhAIACoHCAowzrzdCjDxotIBMPe-jQI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://images-tm.tempo.co/all/2019/07/30/723343/723343_720.jpg,2019-07-30,"{'sent': 'IT was 7am when Wahab Tamati was preparing some food and buckets to gather the eggs of maleo (Macrocephalon maleo) birds in the forest of Hungayono, Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park, in Bone Bolango regency, Gorontalo.', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Wahab Tamati', 'Hungayono'], 'PERSON': ['Gorontalo', 'Bogani Nani'], 'GPE': ['Bone Bolango']}}","IT was 7am when Wahab Tamati was preparing some food and buckets to gather the eggs of maleo (Macrocephalon maleo) birds in the forest of Hungayono, Bogani Nani Wartabone National Park, in Bone Bolango regency, Gorontalo. “I have to reach the nests of maleo before 10 in the morning because the birds only lay eggs from 6am to 10am,” Wahab told Tempo on Wednesday, July 24.

0,"What do Chuck Norris the pig, Farah the monkey, Rojo the llama, Archie the black Lab and Cezar the cockatoo have in common? They’re all service animals who just want to help their humans live their best lives.

Animals and humans have worked together since we lived in caves, but the latest wave of furry and feathered helpers take the animal-human relationship to a new level, says Jessi Gold, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis. “The idea that animals can help emotional health is definitely more widespread,” she says. Today you’ll see critters at work as service animals, therapy animals and emotional support animals, guiding the blind through busy intersections, cheering up children in hospitals and easing the anxieties of veterans with PTSD. Some have spent years in training to perform their tasks, others help just by being themselves. But they’re all part of an explosion in the use of animals to cope with depression, anxiety and disability.

Can they really help? At least one study confirms that therapy animals can improve our social and communication skills, ease our anxiety, brighten our mood and make us more empathetic. Other studies show that just hanging out with a friendly dog lowers our stress: our breathing gets more regular, our heartbeat slows down and our muscles relax.

You may feel more relaxed just reading about some of these animals who are making lives better.

The Galloping Guide

The lunch crowd at the Country Cabin in Jacksonville, Florida, was tucking in for a meal when an unusual patron walked into the restaurant.

It was a miniature horse, just under 3 feet tall. Walking on a leash.

The horse’s human, Cheryl Spencer, introduced Confetti, who is Spencer’s guide horse, to her fellow diners. Confetti, an 18-year-old mare, goes everywhere with Spencer, who is blind: to her job, on planes, on the city bus, to the doctor. They even went to a Tom Jones concert last year. Confetti’s job is to be Spencer’s eyes. “When I need her, she’s with me,” Spencer says. “I couldn’t be as independent without her.”

The Pig That Teaches Empathy

The kids at the Sapling Center, a drop-in facility for at-risk youth in Hazard, Kentucky, burst into smiles when Chuck Norris walks into the room. No, not the two-legged Chuck Norris of 1990s TV fame. This Chuck Norris is a therapy pig. A Juliana miniature pig, to be precise (happyhonkerfarm.com), and he works with kids at the center suffering from anxiety and emotional trauma. “He has an incredible calming effect on them,” says Angie Bush, a licensed counselor who’s the director of youth services at the facility.

Many of the 50 or so kids Bush sees have trouble connecting to others. They’re withdrawn and fearful, and hesitant to trust. “Chuck bridges the gap,” Bush says. “He comes up wagging his tail and nudging the kids with his nose, and their barriers melt.” The kids take care of Chuck, feeding him and walking him. It teaches them empathy and independent living skills, Bush says. “He’s a catalyst for them to pick up life skills.”

Chuck works 15 to 20 hours a week. He has an employee badge, with his photo and name, that he wears on his harness. He’s the ultimate ice breaker, entertaining the kids by ringing a bell on cue, and he can sit, stay and come, just like a dog.

Why a pig? “Pigs have an ability to empathize, they’re highly intelligent and they’re good with children and old people,” Bush says. The novelty of a therapy pig trumps a more predictable animal like a dog, she says. Because how can you resist a wiggly spotted pig who likes hugs?

Still doubting the pig thing? Chuck’s therapy certification training included an obedience class, which he took at a pet store along with a gaggle of dogs. Chuck finished the class two weeks before his canine classmates. “He mastered the skills much faster than the dogs,” Bush says.

Take that, border collies.

The Companion Capuchin

When Kent Converse of Western Massachusetts was paralyzed in an auto accident 13 years ago, his wife, Nancy, realized he needed a hand to make his life easier. A pair of monkey hands, to be specific. Enter Farah, a 35-year-old capuchin monkey. She opens doors for Kent, brings him the phone, gets him a drink from the fridge and puts a straw in it.

Farah spent three years being trained as a service animal by Helping Hands Monkey Helpers, a Boston nonprofit. Helping Hands puts its animals through a three- to five-year training program at its Monkey College. Farah knows 40 one-word commands. Converse tells her “sun” and she turns on the light. He says “fetch,” and she picks up the TV remote he dropped. She’ll even put Kent’s foot back on his wheelchair if it slips off.

But Farah’s more than a set of hands. She’s also a companion. “Kent will get home and Farah will run and jump on him and give him a monkey hug,” Nancy says. “She wraps her legs, arms and tail around him. It’s so pure, so real. It fills your heart with love.” They eat meals with Farah and plan their days around spending time together, just the three of them. “We have a tight family bond,” Nancy says.

The six-pound monkey brought a spark back into their lives that went out after Kent was injured, Nancy says. “Farah was like a magical light that came back on. She made us laugh again and lighten up. [Getting her] is one of the best things we ever did.”

The Happy Horse

Five-year-old Fatima Butler had been living with her family at the Ronald McDonald House in Gainesville, Florida, for two months while her big brother, Christopher, had a heart transplant and brain surgery. She needed a little pick-me-up—and she got it when in walked Mercury, a therapy horse who looks like a My Little Pony toy come to life. Fatima walked with him in the facility’s butterfly garden. She kissed the horse, and the horse nuzzled her back. Then her family FaceTimed her brother so he could see Mercury, too. “He was smiling,” said Michael Butler, the children’s father. “It was nice to see him smile, after all he’s been through.”

Mercury is one of 21 therapy horses from Gentle Carousel, a Gainesville nonprofit that sends the tiny equines to console around 25,000 people a year in hospitals, hospice programs and anywhere there’s been a trauma. Gentle Carousel horses go through a two-year training program where they learn skills ranging from riding in elevators to staying calm around sirens and hospital helicopters. They’re also house-trained.

The little horses bring a lot of joy. Debbie Garcia-Bengochea, the group’s education director, tells of a girl dying from a heart ailment whose last wish was to have a tea party with horses. “We brought them in tuxedos and put sparkles in their manes and tails and told her it was fairy dust,” she says. “The little girl was over the moon. Sometimes you can’t fix things, but you can make someone smile and give them a happy day.”

When therapy llamas Rojo and Smokey walk into an assisted-living facility, a memory-care center or a room full of at-risk kids with autism, everyone wants to pet them. “We’ve seen kids who at first are hesitant to even be in the room with the llamas get comfortable enough to ask to hug and walk them,” says Shannon Joy of the Mtn Peaks Therapy Llamas and Alpacas in Woodland, Washington.

Joy tells of an elderly woman in a nursing home who hadn’t spoken in months. When Rojo nuzzled her, she laughed, touched him and said he was adorable. “The staff was teary-eyed,” she says. “It was the first time the woman had responded to anyone.” The llamas break down barriers for those who are withdrawn or mistrusting in ways a human can’t, she says.

Joy and her mother started Mtn Peaks 12 years ago. The llamas do two to three visits a week and Joy says they’ve helped more people than she can count; four years ago, they did their 1,000th visit. “I’ve lost count of how many places we’ve been to.” One of the highlights of a visit from the llamas: Carrot kisses. A person puts a carrot in their mouth. A 400-pound llama takes it from the them and touches their lips.

“It brings down the house,” Joy says. “It’s pure, genuine joy.”

The Calming Cockatoo

Chris Driggins, a veteran who was battling post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) long after his Army career ended, knows firsthand how powerful a medicine parrot can be. It all began with Cezar, his Goffin’s cockatoo. The Vancouver, Washington, man found out about a family that no longer wanted their bird. He went to get the creature and found him living alone in a tiny cage in a dark garage. It was Cezar. Driggins took him home that day, and soon realized they were a lot alike. They were both lonely, withdrawn and wary of people. He and Cezar became inseparable, and the two of them began to heal one another. Cezar got more sociable, and so did Driggins. Cezar calmed down, and so did Driggins. “My nightmares stopped. I wasn’t anxious anymore,” Driggins says.

He realized if a parrot could help him, parrots could help other veterans. He founded Parrots for Patriots in 2015, and since then he’s placed more than 220 parrots with veterans. “Parrots observe everything you do. They’re more sensitive than a cat or dog, and they’re smarter,” Driggins says. “They bond with a person totally.” Since parrots can live around 60 years, they also help break through a traumatized vet’s fear of loss. A veteran’s “cup is full of sadness. They’ve lost loved ones. A bird lives for decades, so a vet can bond with him with less fear of losing another companion,” Driggins says.

Driggins has his own parrots and he fosters birds awaiting an adopter, so his house is full of parrots singing and squawking. On a recent phone call, he had to talk over a parrot yelling “Meow! Meow!” It’s loud and funny, and he wouldn’t have it any other way. “Parrots saved me. Now I save them so they can help other vets,” Driggins says. “Everybody wins.”

Dogs That Empower

Dogs are the O.G. assistance animals. They’ve been guiding the blind, comforting the sick and calming the distressed for more than a century. Sigmund Freud used his own dog in psychoanalysis sessions, and the first guide dog school opened in 1916 to train dogs to care for World War I veterans. There are nearly 16,000 dogs working as assistance animals in the U.S. Throw in therapy and emotional support dogs, and that number goes into the hundreds of thousands.

Jim Dickson has relied on guide dogs for 27 years since he lost his sight to macular degeneration. Archie, a nearly 4-year-old black Lab, helps him get to his job in Washington, D.C. as an organizer for the National Council on Independent Living. Archie helps him make the mile-long walk from his home to the bus stop, then guides him from the bus to the Metro station, onto the open door of the train, and from the train to his office. Archie even guides Dickson’s hand to the traffic signals at intersections so he can hit the pedestrian button. Dickson’s previous guide dog, Pearson, pulled Dickson out of the path of a car that ran the stop light at an intersection. Not once, but twice. “He saved my life,” Dickson says.

Then there’s Cori, a Labrador/golden retriever mix who teaches kids with disabilities how to swim. Cori, who’s in training to be a service dog, wears a life vest with handles on it. She lets a child hang on to her and gently pulls them through the water in a pool. “A nonverbal child is hard to reach,” says Judy Fridono, Cori’s owner and the founder of Escondido, California–based Puppy Prodigies. “A dog is better at reaching these kids than a human teacher because the communication between the dog and child is different. It’s more powerful.”

Cori worked with a 4-year-old boy with autism who was terrified of the water. He screamed and cried when he got near the pool, and Cori’s handler couldn’t calm him. Since drowning is one of the leading causes of death for kids with autism, teaching the boy to swim is not a luxury but a life-saver. Fridono asked the boy to throw a ball into the pool for Cori. Cori jumped into the pool to get the ball, and within minutes the boy was in the pool, too, holding onto Cori’s jacket. The boy was swimming a few weeks later. There’s no denying it, says Fridono: “Dogs are magical beings.”

Lauren Armstrong certainly thinks so. The 22-year-old Ph.D. student in audiology was just paired in May with a golden Lab named Elroy to be her ears. Trained by nonprofit Canine Companions for Independence to assist the hearing impaired, Elroy has changed Armstrong’s life in many ways.

“He’s helped me become more independent and given me a new confidence,” she says. “He wakes me up in the mornings to an alarm that I can’t hear, helps me with cooking and even when I am driving. Recently he alerted me to a police siren long before the car passed us!” Elroy goes with Armstrong to her audiology appointments and will attend her graduate school classes this fall in Knoxville, Tennessee. Best of all, she says: Elroy has learned to alert her when her name is called at her local coffee shop. No more cold coffee!

They’re all service animals who just want to help their humans live their best lives.

Animals and humans have worked together since we lived in caves, but the latest wave of furry and feathered helpers take the animal-human relationship to a new level, says Jessi Gold, M.D., assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis. “The idea that animals can help emotional health is definitely more widespread,” she says. Today you’ll see critters at work as service animals, therapy animals and emotional support animals, guiding the blind through busy intersections, cheering up children in hospitals and easing the anxieties of veterans with PTSD. Some have spent years in training to perform their tasks, others help just by being themselves. But they’re all part of an explosion in the use of animals to cope with depression, anxiety and disability.

Can they really help? At least one study confirms that therapy animals can improve our social and communication skills, ease our anxiety, brighten our mood and make us more empathetic. Other studies show that just hanging out with a friendly dog lowers our stress: our breathing gets more regular, our heartbeat slows down and our muscles relax.

You may feel more relaxed just reading about some of these animals who are making lives better.

The Galloping Guide

The lunch crowd at the Country Cabin in Jacksonville, Florida, was tucking in for a meal when an unusual patron walked into the restaurant.

It was a miniature horse, just under 3 feet tall. Walking on a leash.

The horse’s human, Cheryl Spencer, introduced Confetti, who is Spencer’s guide horse, to her fellow diners. Confetti, an 18-year-old mare, goes everywhere with Spencer, who is blind: to her job, on planes, on the city bus, to the doctor. They even went to a Tom Jones concert last year. Confetti’s job is to be Spencer’s eyes. “When I need her, she’s with me,” Spencer says. “I couldn’t be as independent without her.”

The Pig That Teaches Empathy

The kids at the Sapling Center, a drop-in facility for at-risk youth in Hazard, Kentucky, burst into smiles when Chuck Norris walks into the room. No, not the two-legged Chuck Norris of 1990s TV fame. This Chuck Norris is a therapy pig. A Juliana miniature pig, to be precise (happyhonkerfarm.com), and he works with kids at the center suffering from anxiety and emotional trauma. “He has an incredible calming effect on them,” says Angie Bush, a licensed counselor who’s the director of youth services at the facility.

Many of the 50 or so kids Bush sees have trouble connecting to others. They’re withdrawn and fearful, and hesitant to trust. “Chuck bridges the gap,” Bush says. “He comes up wagging his tail and nudging the kids with his nose, and their barriers melt.” The kids take care of Chuck, feeding him and walking him. It teaches them empathy and independent living skills, Bush says. “He’s a catalyst for them to pick up life skills.”

Chuck works 15 to 20 hours a week. He has an employee badge, with his photo and name, that he wears on his harness. He’s the ultimate ice breaker, entertaining the kids by ringing a bell on cue, and he can sit, stay and come, just like a dog.

Why a pig? “Pigs have an ability to empathize, they’re highly intelligent and they’re good with children and old people,” Bush says. The novelty of a therapy pig trumps a more predictable animal like a dog, she says. Because how can you resist a wiggly spotted pig who likes hugs?

Still doubting the pig thing? Chuck’s therapy certification training included an obedience class, which he took at a pet store along with a gaggle of dogs. Chuck finished the class two weeks before his canine classmates. “He mastered the skills much faster than the dogs,” Bush says.

Take that, border collies.

The Companion Capuchin

When Kent Converse of Western Massachusetts was paralyzed in an auto accident 13 years ago, his wife, Nancy, realized he needed a hand to make his life easier. A pair of monkey hands, to be specific. Enter Farah, a 35-year-old capuchin monkey. She opens doors for Kent, brings him the phone, gets him a drink from the fridge and puts a straw in it.

Farah spent three years being trained as a service animal by Helping Hands Monkey Helpers, a Boston nonprofit. Helping Hands puts its animals through a three- to five-year training program at its Monkey College. Farah knows 40 one-word commands. Converse tells her “sun” and she turns on the light. He says “fetch,” and she picks up the TV remote he dropped. She’ll even put Kent’s foot back on his wheelchair if it slips off.

But Farah’s more than a set of hands. She’s also a companion. “Kent will get home and Farah will run and jump on him and give him a monkey hug,” Nancy says. “She wraps her legs, arms and tail around him. It’s so pure, so real. It fills your heart with love.” They eat meals with Farah and plan their days around spending time together, just the three of them. “We have a tight family bond,” Nancy says.

The six-pound monkey brought a spark back into their lives that went out after Kent was injured, Nancy says. “Farah was like a magical light that came back on. She made us laugh again and lighten up. [Getting her] is one of the best things we ever did.”

The Happy Horse

Five-year-old Fatima Butler had been living with her family at the Ronald McDonald House in Gainesville, Florida, for two months while her big brother, Christopher, had a heart transplant and brain surgery. She needed a little pick-me-up—and she got it when in walked Mercury, a therapy horse who looks like a My Little Pony toy come to life. Fatima walked with him in the facility’s butterfly garden. She kissed the horse, and the horse nuzzled her back. Then her family FaceTimed her brother so he could see Mercury, too. “He was smiling,” said Michael Butler, the children’s father. “It was nice to see him smile, after all he’s been through.”

Mercury is one of 21 therapy horses from Gentle Carousel, a Gainesville nonprofit that sends the tiny equines to console around 25,000 people a year in hospitals, hospice programs and anywhere there’s been a trauma. Gentle Carousel horses go through a two-year training program where they learn skills ranging from riding in elevators to staying calm around sirens and hospital helicopters. They’re also house-trained.

The little horses bring a lot of joy. Debbie Garcia-Bengochea, the group’s education director, tells of a girl dying from a heart ailment whose last wish was to have a tea party with horses. “We brought them in tuxedos and put sparkles in their manes and tails and told her it was fairy dust,” she says. “The little girl was over the moon. Sometimes you can’t fix things, but you can make someone smile and give them a happy day.”

0,"SEATTLE, WA — Woodland Park Zoo made small, downy history in July when two white-naped crane chicks were born, the first of that species ever born at the zoo.

The unnamed chicks were born on July 9 and 10 to parents Laura, 8, and Cal, 9. The zoo has had white-naped cranes for about 30 years, but none ever produced offspring.

The cranes, native to China, Russia, and Mongolia, are considered a vulnerable species with only about 8,000 living in the wild, according to the International Crane Foundation. They grow to be about 4 feet tall — and much of that height is due to their long, white necks.

""This is such a significant hatching and a symbol of hope for the vulnerable species,"" Woodland Park Zoo bird curator Mark Myers said in a press release. ""The successful breeding and hatching are attributed to the bond between the parents, the quality of their habitat, and the expert day-to-day care and dedication provided by our animal keepers.

CASPER, Wyo. – It’s been nearly a month since workers at the Metro Animal Shelter lost their break room.

Metro was barely able to find space for the dozens of dogs and cats rescued from an extreme hoarding situation, but it’s the eight exotic birds that forced them to convert the staff break and meeting room into an impromptu bird sanctuary.

If all goes as planned, Metro should get their break room back after the birds are transported to the Gabriel Foundation bird rescue organization in Colorado.

Community members were quick to offer to help when the news broke, according to Metro’s director Tory Walsh.

“The best of our community came out,” said Walsh. “We had lots of people people coming out to adopt, but we also had other people come and ask ‘what can I do.'” Metro received volunteers and donations of food and supplies to help care for the animals while the case initially made its way through the system.

Finding homes for cuddly cats and dogs is one thing. It’s quite a different challenge for four macaws, a cockatoo, an African gray, a cockatiel, and an Amazon parrot.

“We’re not bird experts at the police department, so it was important to get advice from experts who handle exotic birds on a daily basis,” said Casper Police Department’s public information officer Rebekah Ladd.

Ladd said they worked to find an organization that is reputable and also has a proven record for adoption paths.

“These birds are from the Casper community and we wanted them to have an opportunity to come back to the Casper community,” said Ladd, who says the foundation will give Casper residents priority on adoptions when the birds are determined to be rehabilitated and fit.

Over the past few weeks, Casper bird expert Tehya Huseas of Birdie Bayou has been tending to the birds. She admits to have become attached to some of them.

“They are highly intelligent animals,” said Huseas, “and they are highly emotional animals.”

(Dan Cepeda, Oil City)

“We liken them to small children…they form strong emotional bonds and learn quickly,” said Huseas. They are also expensive to maintain, she says, which makes finding dedicated owners something of a challenge.

“It’s worth it,” she says. “The emotional attachment they give you, the rewards they give you, it’s more than worth it.”

She says the eight birds show no signs of aggression and seem emotionally stable. “They are birds that have not given up on humans.”

On Monday morning, members of the Gabriel Foundation arrived at Metro to transport the birds.

However, as the foundation members prepared to move the birds, it was discovered that some of the health certificates required to move groups of animals across state lines weren’t in order.

Ladd said the department hoped to have those in place sometime today.

Then, hopefully, Metro staffers can have their break room back.

Casper residents interested in adopting the birds can apply at The Gabriel Foundation’s website.

Update: Police say the paperwork was sorted out, and Gabriel Foundation volunteers were able to leave with the birds by 2 p.m.

CASPER, Wyo. – It’s been nearly a month since workers at the Metro Animal Shelter lost their break room.

Metro was barely able to find space for the dozens of dogs and cats rescued from an extreme hoarding situation, but it’s the eight exotic birds that forced them to convert the staff break and meeting room into an impromptu bird sanctuary.

If all goes as planned, Metro should get their break room back after the birds are transported to the Gabriel Foundation bird rescue organization in Colorado.

The only complaint? It can get a little costly sometimes to take the brood out for the day.

But did you know that the Lion City is teeming with free stuff to do as a family? Here's Young Parents' round-up of the top free things to do in Singapore with kids.

OUTDOOR FUN

NATURE PLAYGARDEN AT HORTPARK

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BwgX0ThgGWF/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]

This free outdoor playground is fabulous for preschoolers from three to six years old. Designed with natural material, it offers nine play features for kids to engage with nature in a fun, free and unconstrained way.

CHILDREN'S GARDEN AT GARDENS BY THE BAY

It's all about having fun at this playscape, which has a dry and wet play area suitable for all ages. Junior will have a splashing good time with sway bridges, interactive stepping springs, water tunnels and fish sculptures.

Older kids will love scaling the two rainforest tree houses, running through tree canopies and hiking along the 130m long forest trail. If you're really lucky, you might even catch a performance at the sheltered amphitheatre.

MARINA BARRAGE

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B1GfDJzlLM5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]

The rooftop here is the go-to place for kite lovers who want to see their dragon or Minion-themed kites soar high up in the sky.

This windy little green pocket is also a great place for some scootering and has shaded spots where you can set up a picnic and enjoy spectacular views of the city skyline.

SINGAPORE BOTANIC GARDENS

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B1DRkbOn3-y/[/embed]

The Gardens provide different tours conducted by volunteers on Saturdays (except on the 5th Saturday of the month).

The walking tours range from a Healing Garden Tour which showcases over 400 varieties of plants used medicinally to a National Orchid Garden Tour that showcases one of the largest collections of orchids in the world and more.

Their most popular tour is the Rain Forest Tour which guides you through the importance of the ecosystem of the Gardens' Rain Forest. It is available in Japanese, Mandarin and English. The guided tours are free.

The revamped Jacob Ballas Children's playground is definitely worth a separate visit, too.

CONEY ISLAND PARK

Pack a picnic, mozzie spray, and water bottles, for a day of full-on outdoor adventures. Explore the island on foot, or on bicycles and scooters. Uncover the beaches - there are five - or cut through the mangrove boardwalk and try to spot some of the 80 species of birds there.

Make a pit stop at the Casuarina Explorer, an obstacle course made entirely from trees and other things found in nature. Conquer the wooden bridge, hop along the stepping stones and climb over tree triangular tree logs.

BISHAN PARK

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B0gP69vDcW8/[/embed]

Featuring one of the prettiest rivers, Bishan Park is a great place to spot fishes and stunning wildflowers, or ride your bikes and scooters along the open lawns.

There are plenty of playgrounds to try out as well, including a water play area and a treehouse adventure park with logs and ropes to climb on. Don't leave without visiting the dog run for some free cuddles from your furry friends (ask the owners for permission first).

THEMED OUTDOOR PLAYGROUNDS

Take your Thomas the Train-loving kid to the iconic tilted train at Tiong Bahru playground. After a recent upgrade, it offers even more climbing and sliding fun, plus a zipline, colourful maze and swings.

YP's other favourite outdoor playgrounds are:

Battleship Playground at Sembawang Park

Nautical-themed playground at Marine Cove

High-rope one playground Woodlands Waterfront

Airplane playground at The Oval, Seletar Aerospace Park

Ship-themed playground at Canberra Street

Eco-themed park at Rumah Tinggi

Military-themed playground at Choa Chu Kang

And of course, the mother of all public parks, Admiralty Park, an adventure wonderland made up of 26 slides.

FIRE STATION OPEN HOUSES

Kids up at the crack of dawn on Saturdays? Take them to the nearest fire station between 9am and 11am for a free tour.

Your little firemen will love spraying with gigantic hoses, climbing fire trucks and ""riding"" motorbikes. If they are very lucky, they might even get to slide down the fireman's pole! Some fire stations don't host open houses; get the full list on the Singapore Civil Defence Force website.

FARMS

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BosmAh9F5dR/[/embed]

Escape into rural Singapore for some fresh air and one-on-one time with nature's best. At Jurong Frog Farm, your little ones can jump into a frog pen with a net and gumboots to catch tadpoles or wrestle bullfrogs.

Head on over to Farmart Centre to cosy up to bunnies, hamsters and goats, then feed the koi fishes and say, ""hello"" to the prawns in the pond.

If the kids like reptiles, they can pet a red-eyed Elongata Tortoise and majestic Alligator turtle.

Don't forget fruit and vegetables farm, Oh' Farms, plus a cow farm, Viknesh Dairy Farm, and goat farm, Hay Dairies.

BOLLYWOOD VEGGIES

Your little nature-lover will enjoy exploring every nook and cranny of this 10-acre slice of paradise, which grows local veggies, herbs, fruits and flowers. Run through trellis arches, hide behind massive banana leaves and try to spot a squirrel or maybe even a monitor lizard.

It's rustic play at its best. Entrance is free, but you're encouraged to make a small donation.

THE ANIMAL RESORT

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BuilxPRgEi7/[/embed]

The kampong spirit is very much alive at this little spot located along Seletar West Farmway that's home to a motley crew of animals, including a ravenous horse, a surly stork, fishes, peacocks, rabbits, guinea pigs and a cassowary, an unusual-looking feathered friend.

Chickens, birds and geese roam freely, and you can feed them with grub sold at the farm for a small fee. YP also loves the old-school swings and climbing structures.

RESERVOIRS

More than just water catchment areas, Singapore's reservoirs are a great way to slip out of the crazy city life for a few hours.

Head to the scenic Lower Seletar Reservoir (pictured) for a boardwalk stroll and to frolic in the water play area, which has a small stream, wading pool and jet streams and giant flower structures that spurt water. Or take the excitement up a notch at MacRitchie where you can visit with the resident macaques - hold on tight to your snacks - and do a tree top walk.

SUNGEI BULOH WETLAND RESERVE

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B00ToifgbR7/[/embed]

Singapore's first wetland reserve is the largest mangrove forest home to a wide diversity of flora and fauna, including migratory birds. Start off with the mid-canopy walk, an elevated 120m-long boardwalk as you try to spot insects and birds.

Then, do the forest trail walk and come face-to-face with tiny mudskippers. Little ones will love the Junior Adventure Trail, a play area made up of steps, poles and even a pulley boat. Free guided tours are held on weekends; some are specially tailored for kids.

KRANJI MARSHES

If your kids like Sungei Buloh, pay a visit to Kranji Marshes, which is the largest freshwater marshland in Singapore and home to a host of local wildlife. Check NParks' website for the latest information on guided walks there.

LAKESIDE GARDENS

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Kyj1PHoJA/[/embed]

Opened in late April 2019, this new park is worth the journey to western Singapore. Spot wildlife, play in the largest nature play garden in the heartlands, ride a pedal boat, frolic in the water play pools and more.

CHINESE AND JAPANESE GARDENS

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B0_gdnXFv0a/[/embed]

Sitting on the tranquil Jurong Lake are the magnificent Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The former has Chinese imperial style-inspired architecture and lots of space to stroll through pavilions, bridges, tea houses and a stunning bonsai collection.

Climb the seven-storey pagoda and enjoy breathtaking views of the adjoining Japanese Gardens, which has Japanese-styled pagodas originating from the Muromachi and Momoyama periods, arched bridges and rock waterfalls. Keep an eye out for the resident birds and monitor lizards. Visit them before they are renovated under the Jurong Lake Gardens plan.

SCIENCE CENTRE OBSERVATORY

Are your tykes obsessed with outer space and planets? Let them stay up late and head down to the Omni-Theatre building between 7.45pm and 10pm every Friday for a star and moon gazing session through portable telescopes and a smaller observation dome. Who knows, it might spark a love for astronomy in them.

INDOOR FUN

ISTANA HERITAGE GALLERY

History buffs young and old will love getting a glimpse of Singapore's own Palace. Learn more about the building's past, peruse through the guest book to see if your favourite Queen or politician has visited, then marvel at the stunning state gifts received over the years.

Keep an eye out for the silver goblets and the bust of an Induna (a tribal councillor or headman) presented by the late South African President Nelson Mandela.

Inspired enough to check out the real deal? The Istana grounds are open to public five days a year during major public holidays. Entrance is free, but get ready to queue.

CHANGI AIRPORT

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B1I6EFmg4lX/[/embed]

There are so many reasons to head East, even if you're not catching a flight. For starters, free air-conditioned playgrounds at every terminal - including the newest one at Terminal 4 that's modelled like a gigantic chandelier, complete with climbing nets and slides.

Throw in free arts and crafts areas, endless trips on the sky train, plenty of space to run around and watch the airplanes land and take-off, plus great eateries, and it's no wonder Changi Airport is a favourite destination for affordable fun.

LIBRARY@HARBOURFRONT

Head to Vivocity's third floor from Jan 12 to visit the brand new library@harbourfront, which boasts spectacular views. It's the largest mall library here, spanning some 3,000 sq m, and there's something for everyone in the family. The children's section has paper crafting activities and word puzzles, and young ones can read augmented reality books as well.

SINGAPORE DISCOVERY CENTRE

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BksScOdnkWq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]

Give your older kids, and yourself, a crash course on the place you call home. Tour the Military Academy and Army Museum, where you will learn more about NSmen and then experience a simulated bomb explosion.

Then, take part in a 4-D simulator ride and learn dance routines of the different races at a digital dance studio. The interactive fun continues outdoors at the Discovery Lake where you can take in a game of paintball or a round of pedal boating.

THE ARTGROUND

Who says babies are too young to experience the arts? From soothing and engaging performances for tiny tots to open spaces for preschoolers to run around and explore, a spanking new children's arts centre offers an array of multisensory experiences for kids aged 12 and below.

The interactive installations at The Ground Floor are free. It features installations that are refreshed thrice a year. The large area encourages kids aged two to 12 to run free and explore all the elements of the various interactive art installations around them.

Ticketed programmes and workshops which take place every weekend have varied admission prices and tickets can be bought on-site. Do take note that some activities may require pre-registration.

SINGAPORE MARITIME GALLERY

Here, your little ones can pretend to be a ship's captain at the bridge simulator of this maritime gallery, which takes you through Singapore's history from a small trading post to a global maritime centre.

MALLS

MALL PLAYGROUNDS

Kids behaving well during a shopping trip at the mall? Reward them with a stop at a playground. Most of the malls here have either an indoor or outdoor one in various themes that are fully-equipped with activity stations, kiddie rides, tunnels, climbing structures, slides, and soft landing pads.

The best part? They have sitting areas for you to relax while keeping an eye on the kiddos. YP's favourites include:

Paragon

Waterway Point

IMM

Compass One

City Square Mall

Vivocity

MALL ROOFTOP WATER PLAY AREAS

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxr35PBH83n/[/embed]

Not that we need a reason to head to the mall, but knowing that it has a rooftop water play area makes it easier to get your shopping done and not feel guilty about not having something planned for the kiddos.

They come in various child-friendly themes and have colourful slides, splash pads and even gigantic water buckets that will soak everyone - including parents sitting on the sidelines, if you're not careful.

YPs' favourites are:

Kallang Wave Mall

Nex

Tampines 1

MUSEUMS

KEPPEL CENTRE FOR ART EDUCATION

Located in the National Gallery Singapore, this is an incredible play space for little ones.

The Art Playscape will have you in awe. Created by artist Sandra Lee, the space takes you into a whole new world, just like stepping right into the pages of a pop-up storybook.

Jump up the elevated lily pads at the pond, sit for a cup of tea with the forest animals, or explore the split-level tree house which has various crawl spaces, talk tubes and periscopes to give kids different views of the space.

NATIONAL MUSEUM

Enjoy family time at the National Museum of Singapore every last Saturday of the month. The variety of activities include interactive tours, storytelling sessions, family workshops, drop-in craft activities, captivating performances, and more.

The highlight of this museum is the 2,000 sqm outdoor gallery, home to Singapore Air Force planes old and new.

Your future pilot will love exploring a range of planes, some on the ground and others suspended from a 16m high ceiling, including the Hawker Hunter, UH-1B Helicopter and A4-S Skyhawk.

You can also check out air defence artillery such as the Bloodhound Missile and aircraft engines like the Rolls Royce Bristol Viper.

Your little nature-lover will enjoy exploring every nook and cranny of this 10-acre slice of paradise, which grows local veggies, herbs, fruits and flowers. Run through trellis arches, hide behind massive banana leaves and try to spot a squirrel or maybe even a monitor lizard.

It's rustic play at its best. Entrance is free, but you're encouraged to make a small donation.

THE ANIMAL RESORT

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BuilxPRgEi7/[/embed]

The kampong spirit is very much alive at this little spot located along Seletar West Farmway that's home to a motley crew of animals, including a ravenous horse, a surly stork, fishes, peacocks, rabbits, guinea pigs and a cassowary, an unusual-looking feathered friend.

Chickens, birds and geese roam freely, and you can feed them with grub sold at the farm for a small fee. YP also loves the old-school swings and climbing structures.

RESERVOIRS

More than just water catchment areas, Singapore's reservoirs are a great way to slip out of the crazy city life for a few hours.

Head to the scenic Lower Seletar Reservoir (pictured) for a boardwalk stroll and to frolic in the water play area, which has a small stream, wading pool and jet streams and giant flower structures that spurt water. Or take the excitement up a notch at MacRitchie where you can visit with the resident macaques - hold on tight to your snacks - and do a tree top walk.

SUNGEI BULOH WETLAND RESERVE

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B00ToifgbR7/[/embed]

Singapore's first wetland reserve is the largest mangrove forest home to a wide diversity of flora and fauna, including migratory birds. Start off with the mid-canopy walk, an elevated 120m-long boardwalk as you try to spot insects and birds.

Then, do the forest trail walk and come face-to-face with tiny mudskippers. Little ones will love the Junior Adventure Trail, a play area made up of steps, poles and even a pulley boat. Free guided tours are held on weekends; some are specially tailored for kids.

KRANJI MARSHES

If your kids like Sungei Buloh, pay a visit to Kranji Marshes, which is the largest freshwater marshland in Singapore and home to a host of local wildlife. Check NParks' website for the latest information on guided walks there.

LAKESIDE GARDENS

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Kyj1PHoJA/[/embed]

Opened in late April 2019, this new park is worth the journey to western Singapore. Spot wildlife, play in the largest nature play garden in the heartlands, ride a pedal boat, frolic in the water play pools and more.

CHINESE AND JAPANESE GARDENS

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B0_gdnXFv0a/[/embed]

Sitting on the tranquil Jurong Lake are the magnificent Chinese and Japanese Gardens. The former has Chinese imperial style-inspired architecture and lots of space to stroll through pavilions, bridges, tea houses and a stunning bonsai collection.

Climb the seven-storey pagoda and enjoy breathtaking views of the adjoining Japanese Gardens, which has Japanese-styled pagodas originating from the Muromachi and Momoyama periods, arched bridges and rock waterfalls. Keep an eye out for the resident birds and monitor lizards. Visit them before they are renovated under the Jurong Lake Gardens plan.

SCIENCE CENTRE OBSERVATORY

Are your tykes obsessed with outer space and planets? Let them stay up late and head down to the Omni-Theatre building between 7.45pm and 10pm every Friday for a star and moon gazing session through portable telescopes and a smaller observation dome. Who knows, it might spark a love for astronomy in them.

INDOOR FUN

ISTANA HERITAGE GALLERY

History buffs young and old will love getting a glimpse of Singapore's own Palace. Learn more about the building's past, peruse through the guest book to see if your favourite Queen or politician has visited, then marvel at the stunning state gifts received over the years.

Keep an eye out for the silver goblets and the bust of an Induna (a tribal councillor or headman) presented by the late South African President Nelson Mandela.

Inspired enough to check out the real deal? The Istana grounds are open to public five days a year during major public holidays. Entrance is free, but get ready to queue.

CHANGI AIRPORT

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/B1I6EFmg4lX/[/embed]

There are so many reasons to head East, even if you're not catching a flight. For starters, free air-conditioned playgrounds at every terminal - including the newest one at Terminal 4 that's modelled like a gigantic chandelier, complete with climbing nets and slides.

Throw in free arts and crafts areas, endless trips on the sky train, plenty of space to run around and watch the airplanes land and take-off, plus great eateries, and it's no wonder Changi Airport is a favourite destination for affordable fun.

LIBRARY@HARBOURFRONT

Head to Vivocity's third floor from Jan 12 to visit the brand new library@harbourfront, which boasts spectacular views. It's the largest mall library here, spanning some 3,000 sq m, and there's something for everyone in the family. The children's section has paper crafting activities and word puzzles, and young ones can read augmented reality books as well.

SINGAPORE DISCOVERY CENTRE

[embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/BksScOdnkWq/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link[/embed]

Give your older kids, and yourself, a crash course on the place you call home. Tour the Military Academy and Army Museum, where you will learn more about NSmen and then experience a simulated bomb explosion.

Then, take part in a 4-D simulator ride and learn dance routines of the different races at a digital dance studio. The interactive fun continues outdoors at the Discovery Lake where you can take in a game of paintball or a round of pedal boating.

THE ARTGROUND

Who says babies are too young to experience the arts? From soothing and engaging performances for tiny tots to open spaces for preschoolers to run around and explore, a spanking new children's arts centre offers an array of multisensory experiences for kids aged 12 and below.

The interactive installations at The Ground Floor are free. It features installations that are refreshed thrice a year. The large area encourages kids aged two to 12 to run free and explore all the elements of the various interactive art installations around them.

Ticketed programmes and workshops which take place every weekend have varied admission prices and tickets can be bought on-site. Do take note that some activities may require pre-registration.

SINGAPORE MARITIME GALLERY

Here, your little ones can pretend to be a ship's captain at the bridge simulator of this maritime gallery, which takes you through Singapore's history from a small trading post to a global maritime centre.

MALLS

MALL PLAYGROUNDS

Kids behaving well during a shopping trip at the mall? Reward them with a stop at a playground. Most of the malls here have either an indoor or outdoor one in various themes that are fully-equipped with activity stations, kiddie rides, tunnels, climbing structures, slides, and soft landing pads.

The best part? They have sitting areas for you to relax while keeping an eye on the kiddos. YP's favourites include:

Inspiring Iguana Conservation in Fiji

Jone Niukula has experience managing the Sigatoka Sand Dunes National Park and Yadua Taba Wildlife Sanctuary, both natural heritage sites in Fiji. He has contributed to endangered species conservation programs for the Critically Endangered Fiji Petrel and endemic iguanas. Since 2002, Jone has worked for the National Trust of Fiji.

Why did you become a conservationist?

After studying Geography and Geology at the University of the South Pacific, I was quite excited about finding work in the environmental field. I lived close to the National Trust Director’s home at that time, and she invited me to apply for a job at the Trust. When I applied, I learned that the Trust’s main purpose was not only to protect nature, but our cultural heritage as well.

Tell us about a time that you felt you had made a difference as a conservationist.

I like to believe that my strength lies in communicating and working with the traditional landowners and the native community. My work includes overlooking the iguana conservation program in Fiji and achieving positive relationships with the community that helps run the programs through their support and involvement.

What has surprised you the most in the field?

The existence of different kinds of species in a relatively small country like Fiji. In addition, the species are endemic or at least a sub-species or race special to an area and found nowhere else in the world.

What inspires you most or makes you proud about being a Fellow?

I believe I’m one of the few, if not the only, Fellow from a Pacific Island country this year. So my participation in this program shows the significance of our fauna and flora in the Pacific and the conservation work that is currently being carried out.

I’m also happy to participate because I have the opportunity to be a part of the protection of a unique iguana species that occurs only in the Pacific that’s also a delicacy for the traditional landowners. Tell us about a conservation challenge in your job.

Tell us about a conservation challenge.

A major conservation challenge in Fiji is convincing landowners to surrender their land or resources to save a species. Fijians have come to realize in the past few decades the value of natural resources and that they can receive money if they surrender land or resources. Fortunately, for a few programs, some species of concern have cultural value that will certainly support the need to save them.

Tell us about a conservation success.

Monuriki Island was identified in the Iguana Specialist Group meeting in 2004 as a priority site for conservation of the Fijian Crested Iguana (Brachylophus vitiensis). However, before 2004 and until 2009, there have been numerous requests made to the landowners to remove goats that were introduced to the island in the 1970s and were a major cause of degradation on the island.

In 2010, a team from the National Trust visited the landowners to request for the removal of iguanas for a captive breeding program. This was well received by a newly installed chief who also stated that he would order the removal of that goats, which surprised and excited the visiting conservation team.

And in 2015, the first 32 captive-bred Crested Iguanas were released back on Monuriki Island. In 2017, the captive breeding program was brought to an end when 16 of the original 20 iguana founders, and an additional 32 captive bred offspring, were released. Only a few young iguanas remain in captivity at the moment and are set for release in June.

Between February and June 2017, 35 wild iguanas (not passing through captivity) were caught and marked. Many of these were young animals that would have hatched after the goat and rat eradication was completed in late 2011. This sample of iguanas revealed that, within five years, the small remaining population of iguanas is reproducing and recruiting back into the recovering habitat.

Why is conservation important?

This question can have different answers depending on which stakeholder you are in the program. But the most important answer is to save species and ecosystems from being lost forever from this world.

Guatemalan poachers inside the Chiquibul Forest are responsible for the loss of more than twenty-five Scarlet Macaws. This is according to Friends for Conservation and Development (FCD) as they express concerns over the illegal wildlife trafficking. A release from the FCD noted that in a national consensus conducted this year, it was found that Belize has a minimum of 334 individual parrots in the wild. The FCD has rung the alarm, signalling that something needs to be done before the birds go extinct. Executive director of FCD, Rafael Manzanero, told us that more volunteers would be needed to help remedy the situation.

Rafael Manzanero, Executive Director, FCD: “Well the scarlet macaw is basically targeted because it is sold on the market as a pet and so it is one of those main species targeted for illegal wildlife trafficking. It seems that these guys who are basically poaching parrots for the many years they have been able to become more skilled in being able to treat and to keep parrots alive. It is interesting because it appears that even small and tiny parrots are being removed from the nests and in fact some of them might still have their eyes closed but it seems that they know how to treat these birds that the probability would seem that these birds are able to survive even though I’m pretty sure some of them might die but they would still take the risk in terms of keeping them very small and rearing them in their own house and after a couple of weeks or months they would put in on the market for sale. Earlier this year we managed to find other remote nesting and breeding areas for macaws thus we believe that it is those areas that are really remote in the upper Macal and other areas that are basically being targeted. We were not really certain about those areas before but earlier this year around the month of February we basically launched some patrols. Basically starting from November up until January we were able to locate what appeared to be other nesting areas and so it seems to us that those would be the main areas being targeted over the last recent months so those areas now we will have to start to look to put in more patrols and more people to have a sort of monitoring program in those remote areas. The only problem with that is that it requires more man power and thus we would need another 300% more of basically men that we would require to do that work and that would mean a lot of finances which we do not have. So the other alternative is basically to look at those that are under threat and hopefully the Government will give us the permission to extract them and put them in a lab setting.”

This is according to Friends for Conservation and Development (FCD) as they express concerns over the illegal wildlife trafficking. A release from the FCD noted that in a national consensus conducted this year, it was found that Belize has a minimum of 334 individual parrots in the wild. The FCD has rung the alarm, signalling that something needs to be done before the birds go extinct. Executive director of FCD, Rafael Manzanero, told us that more volunteers would be needed to help remedy the situation.

Rafael Manzanero, Executive Director, FCD: “Well the scarlet macaw is basically targeted because it is sold on the market as a pet and so it is one of those main species targeted for illegal wildlife trafficking. It seems that these guys who are basically poaching parrots for the many years they have been able to become more skilled in being able to treat and to keep parrots alive. It is interesting because it appears that even small and tiny parrots are being removed from the nests and in fact some of them might still have their eyes closed but it seems that they know how to treat these birds that the probability would seem that these birds are able to survive even though I’m pretty sure some of them might die but they would still take the risk in terms of keeping them very small and rearing them in their own house and after a couple of weeks or months they would put in on the market for sale. Earlier this year we managed to find other remote nesting and breeding areas for macaws thus we believe that it is those areas that are really remote in the upper Macal and other areas that are basically being targeted. We were not really certain about those areas before but earlier this year around the month of February we basically launched some patrols. Basically starting from November up until January we were able to locate what appeared to be other nesting areas and so it seems to us that those would be the main areas being targeted over the last recent months so those areas now we will have to start to look to put in more patrols and more people to have a sort of monitoring program in those remote areas. The only problem with that is that it requires more man power and thus we would need another 300% more of basically men that we would require to do that work and that would mean a lot of finances which we do not have. So the other alternative is basically to look at those that are under threat and hopefully the Government will give us the permission to extract them and put them in a lab setting.”

Thundering down more than 100 metres, the Kalandula Falls is one example of the natural beauty in Malanje Province, which could be a tourism goldmine with the right investment.

Tilson Machado came to Kalandula Falls as a child, and it was terrifying for him.

Now a computer engineering professor in Malanje, he´s back to show off Kalandula to his friends, colleagues and family from the capital Luanda.

“I´m feeling the power of nature,” Machado says. “And nature is amazing.”

Also amazing is the tourism potential, says Francisco Faísca, owner of Pousada Das Quedas, the lone hotel at the site. He says the more competition, the better.

“It would be worthwhile for other investors to invest in the area, so that there be a real a tourist destination, so that we had instead of one hotel, two, three, four, five hotels.”

Malanje Province also has Cangandala National Park and the Luando Nature Reserve, aimed at saving the Giant Sable Antelope from extinction.

It's another national symbol that adorns Angola´s airliners and is proudly worn by its football teams.

Pedro Vaz Pinto has spent 16 years tracking what the Angolans call the Palanca Negra, of which only a few hundred are left.

“I can see Cangandala has a huge potential for mass tourism, because I think it is of critical importance to make the Giant Sable available for schoolchildren, available for decision-makers and for tourists in general.

“It´s got large rivers, it's got hippopotamuses, it´s got a lion population, and also Giant Sable. It also has a huge potential for a different type of tourism, a tourist that is prepared spend a week, tracking the animals.”

Michel Amon is a French resident from Luanda who brought his family over from Europe to see Malanje Province.

He describes Kalandula Falls as “quite simply magnificent”.

“They are like a lot of sites in Angola – there are very beautiful places here,” he said.

The Kwanza River Rapids outside Malanje city is another place with vast tourism potential, as is the new hydroelectric Lauca Dam and reservoir on the Kwanza River.

As deep as 150 metres, it’s more than 30 kilometres long and perfect for a range of water-based activities.

“Our tourist potential is very strong in relation to the fauna and flora, and it’s totally unspoilt,” says Mono Katusevana, Construction Supervisor at Lauca Dam. “They can water ski, they can climb, climb our mountains, they can do sport fishing.”",Angola's Malanje Province: a tourism bonanza waiting for investment,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEPg2zh1lKrCjdRC0qZxew64qFwgEKg8IACoHCAow-ZzLBzD77Ecwm8B5?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/99/87/84/1000x563_cmsv2_adac8872-e53b-5f71-8491-b6178bd5aeac-3998784.jpg,2019-09-18,"{'sent': 'From a spectacular waterfall that rivals Victoria Falls to parkland with amazing wildlife, Angola’s Malanje Province has plenty to offer tourists and investors alike.\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Victoria Falls'], 'GPE': ['Angola', 'Malanje Province']}}","From a spectacular waterfall that rivals Victoria Falls to parkland with amazing wildlife, Angola’s Malanje Province has plenty to offer tourists and investors alike.

0,"Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | This is a list of the bird species recorded in Uganda by Uganda Tourism Center (UTC), a leading independent tourism and holiday resource center responsible for marketing Uganda worldwide. Uganda has a total 1061 species of birds.

This list has been designed in sequence of orders, families, and species and we have listed them in common and scientific names.

Ostriches ( Ostrich Struthio camelus)

The Ostrich is a flightless bird native to Africa. It is the largest living species of bird. It is distinctive in its appearance, with a long neck and legs and the ability to run at high speeds.

Grebes

Grebes are small to medium-large sized freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes, and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are 20 species worldwide and 3 species which occur in Uganda.

Little Grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis)

Great Crested (Grebe Podiceps cristatus)

Eared Grebe (Podiceps nigricollis)

Shearwaters and petrels

Terns

Terns are a group of generally general medium to large sea-birds typically with grey or white plumage, often with black markings on the head. Most terns hunt fish by diving but some pick insects off the surface of fresh water. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with several species now known to live in excess of 25 to 30 years. There are 44 species worldwide and 7 species which occur in Uganda.

Gull-billed Tern (Sterna nilotica)

Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia)

Lesser Crested Tern (Sterna bengalensis)

Common Tern (Sterna hirundo)

Whiskered Tern (Chlidonias hybridus)

White-winged Tern (Chlidonias leucopterus)

Black Tern (Chlidonias niger)

Skimmers

Skimmers are a small family of tropical tern-like birds. They have an elongated lower mandible which they use to feed by flying low over the water surface and skimming the water for small fish. There are 3 species worldwide and 1 species which occurs in Uganda.

African Skimmer Rynchops flavirostris

Sandgrouse

Sandgrouse have small, pigeon like heads and necks, but sturdy compact bodies. They have long pointed wings and sometimes tails and a fast direct flight. Flocks fly to watering holes at dawn and dusk. Their legs are feathered down to the toes. There are 16 species worldwide and 3 species which occur in Uganda.

0,"Millions of birds of over 250 species are thought to inhabit China’s coastal wetlands every year, accounting for 80% of the country’s aquatic birds and including endangered species such as the red-crowned crane, the black-faced spoonbill and the oriental stork. They supply food for the birds as they breed, migrate, rest and overwinter.

Coastal wetlands also help regulate the environment, by retaining and absorbing nutrients, purifying water, preventing soil erosion and protecting the coastline. For example, mangrove forests shield the land from typhoons and storm tides, while kelp beds clean water by absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus.

China’s coastal regions are home to 40% of its population, 50% of its major cities and generate 60% of its GDP. But development of the coast is heavily dependent on the biodiversity found there. We used one set of data to carry out an in-depth analysis of the relationship between China’s 32,000km of coastline and 22,000 marine species (10% of the global total). Of the world’s seabird species, 23% are found and China, along with 14% of fish species. There are 2,500 commercial fish species, 800 commercial shrimp and crabs, and 100 commercial aquatic plants. Species such as the Chinese sturgeon, the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, five species of sea turtle, a horseshoe crab and dugong are either unique to China, or endangered worldwide.

Meanwhile, China catches 13 million tonnes of seafood every year, worth 200 billion yuan (US$28 billion) and accounting for 20% of national seafood production. Marine species are also sources of important drugs for the medical industry – 1,000 have been identified as of medical use, with 250 containing substances that can help to treat cancer.

But coastal wetland areas are among the most affected and damaged by human activity, and suffer the largest drops in biodiversity. Disorderly and excessive development, pollution and illegal fishing have seen China lose more than 50% of its temperate coastal wetlands, 73% of its mangrove forests and 80% of its coral reefs. Large expanses of inshore habitats have been lost or degraded and ecosystem connectivity has fallen significantly, leading to sharp and sustained drops in the number of marine species, with increasing numbers of species becoming endangered.

For example, Shenzhen’s 40 years of rapid growth have seen mangrove forests shrink by half and aquatic bird numbers plummet by two-thirds. There is little cause for optimism about the biodiversity of China’s coastal wetlands. If these losses continue, China’s 200 billion yuan (US$28 billion) annual seafood catch and efforts to develop its marine economy will greatly suffer.

As part of building an ecological civilisation, China has taken a number of measures to improve the situation. Strong attempts have been made to bolster management and protection of marine biodiversity in line with a principle of “conserving while developing and developing while conserving”, with a revision of the Marine Environment Protection Law, establishment of priority marine conservation zones, better ocean zoning and a lifetime responsibility approach to marine environment damage, all of which have produced results.

For example, in 2016 and 2017 three documents were issued to ensure the conservation, management and appropriate use of coastal wetlands, including a program for wetland restoration, guidance on conservation and management of wetlands, and an overall wetlands conservation program for the 13th Five Year Plan period. A 2018 crackdown on land reclamation has also helped.

To date, China has established over 250 marine protected areas, covering 123,000 km2, or 4.1% of China’s total marine area. This includes 37,000 km2 of inshore waters, 9.7% of the total. Species protected include the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, a rare species of lancelet, the Chinese horseshoe crab, and several coral, along with ecosystems such as mangrove forests, coral reefs, river mouth wetlands and islands. Since 2011, 42 national marine parks have been set up, and China aims to have 5% of its waters protected by 2020.

0,"For Kelly Bradley of the Fort Worth Zoo, the Iguana Fest on Anegeda is the happiest day of the year.

“This is my favourite day,” she said Monday. “I love this day more than Christmas because it’s such a happy day and I get to talk about my favourite subject.”

The energy and excitement felt during the seventh Iguana Fest was contagious and seemed to infect children and adults alike. Community members gathered to celebrate the Anegada rock iguana, a critically endangered species endemic to the territory.

At the Anegada Iguana Headstart Facility in The Settlement, students from all the major islands of the territory participated in a day filled with games and activities centred around the lizards.

“It is the happiest day on Anegada,” said Ms. Bradley, who is affiliated with the Headstart programme and visits the island each year working to conserve the critically endangered Anegada rock iguana. “We start with the run in the morning and we have breakfast and we have games. Each of these games teach something about iguanas.”

With music by DJ Richie Rich and food set up by Bolo’s Backyard BBQ, adults were also entertained throughout the day as the iguana celebration continued.

250 iguanas released

This year, the facility has released more than 250 iguanas into the wild to encourage the growth of the population.

The facility was created in 1997 by the National Parks Trust and the Iguana Specialist Group, one of more than 100 specialist groups organised through the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Species Survival Commission. It raises young iguanas until they are old enough to survive in the wild, thereby helping protect them from their main predators: cats.

“We know that 80 percent of what we put back makes it,” Ms. Bradley said. “When they’re 400 grams, we put them back in. A big female would be around 4,000 grams and a big male about 7,000 grams. Some people don’t like to see animals in cages, but we’re just getting them over that vulnerable period.”

In the past 30 years, the International Iguana Foundation — a Fort Worth, Texas-based non-profit organisation that works closely with the Iguana Specialist Group — has routinely estimated that around 200 to 300 individuals of the species remain living in the wild, mostly on Anegada.

If that number is accurate, the facility’s recent releases could have doubled that population. Still, the rock iguana is currently on the IUCN’s Red List and is considered a “critically endangered species.”

This designation, Ms. Bradley said, is one step above “functionally extinct.” To earn that label, a species would have no chance of survival because it would be unable to carry on its genes. With an additional 250 rock iguanas released by the Headstart facility, chances for the species to survive appear to be increasing.

The hurricanes

The Headstart facility aims to guarantee the iguanas food, shelter and a safe place to lay eggs.

A grant from the Disney Conservation Fund helped pay for new cages, which were upgraded shortly before hurricanes Irma and Maria hit. The facility replaced all the rotted wood with new wood and made the cages heavier.

According to Ms. Bradley, it takes 20 people to lift just one of the several eight-cage units.

“They didn’t go up anywhere during the hurricane,” she said.

The facilities were barely affected by the storms. Some doors flew off and one of the larger cages was punctured, but a majority of the iguanas remained confined.

Having been around for seven million years, the wild iguanas already know a thing or two about survival. Not only would they have sensed a change in pressure and known to seek shelter, they also benefitted from the storms, according to the biologist.

“Hurricanes are really bad for people, but they’re really good for iguanas,” she said. “Because what happens is the hurricane comes and it gives all these plants a huge haircut and then it dumps all this water. All these plants poofed out with all new leaves. The iguanas gorged on all the soft, tender vegetation.

“And then you have the seed bank, which are all the seeds in the ground that haven’t germinated. When you dump all that water, all those seeds germinate. Out in the wild [the rock iguanas] were probably the fattest I’ve ever seen them.”

Mutual benefits

The species has adapted to the unpredictable weather here, and once had numbers up to 20,000 strong, according to Ms. Bradley. Anegada, she said, can easily support that kind of number.

The island may also be dependent on the iguanas for its own health: Ms. Bradley calls the lizards “farmers of the forest” because of the role they play in spreading seeds.

Seeds from the berries that the reptiles eat are deposited throughout the island and they create what Ms. Bradley described as a “mosaic of a forest — not just one kind of tree.”

“Then we’ve shown that seeds that travel through an iguana gut germinate faster: The little seedlings have a higher survivorship, and they have a faster growth. So there might be a coevolution where some of these plants are actually dependent,” she said, citing an example of a plant called “black sage” on the island.

The critically endangered plant, which is native to Anegada, is abundant in several areas heavily populated by the iguanas, Ms. Bradley said.

“[The iguanas] keep this forest healthy,” she explained. “They keep the forest healthy for everybody.”

Biological diversity

Of the 50 species of iguanas in the world, Ms. Bradley added, 16 are found in the Caribbean.

“We know that out of the 16 that are in the Caribbean this is the oldest of all of them,” she said. “Not only is it the most primitive, but it has the most unique volume of genes that you don’t see in any of the other 16.”

For example, three species of iguanas are found in the Bahamas, but they are all closely related and linked together genetically, she said. The Anegada rock iguana, by contrast, stands apart.

The community on Anegada has been very responsive in helping protect the species, Ms. Bradley said: Whenever a nest of young is spotted, residents often either call her or the National Parks Trust.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of a remarkable project to save the beautiful Yellow-eared Parrot, which at the time was teetering on the edge of extinction, following its rediscovery in Colombia. Fundación ProAves, Loro Parque Fundación (LPF) and other organisations are celebrating the historic accomplishments of shared ongoing efforts in research, conservation and education over the last two decades of Proyecto Ognorhynchus.

Throughout the 20th century to the present day the decline of wildlife populations, particularly in tropical forests, has been inexorable, but few species showed such a catastrophic decrease as Yellow-eared Parrot. At the beginning of the last century the species was common in mountain forests in the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador, where it depended on Quindío wax palms, the world's tallest palm, for nesting, roosting and feeding.



Previously widely present across Colombia and Ecuador, Yellow-eared Parrot is now found only in the former country (Fundación ProAves).

By 1991, only two flocks were known to survive, none were recorded in captivity and the global population numbered fewer than 50 individuals. Extensive conservation and research efforts in Ecuador were led by Dr Niels Krabbe and supported by LPF, which purchased land to protect a stand of palms and forest used by the last dwindling flock of 21 individuals in Ecuador.

However, this final group vanished in 1998, and extinction seemed inevitable. In 1986 the wax palm was declared the national tree of Colombia, but it is also threatened, having been assessed as globally Vulnerable by IUCN – deforestation for cattle pastures combined with overharvesting of the trees' leaves for use in the Catholic celebration of Palm Sunday have almost wiped it out.

However, in 1997, there was a report of a flock of 24 Yellow-eared Parrots in the Cordillera Central of Colombia, prompting a team to establish a search and recover project, Proyecto Ognorhynchus (and eventually to establish Fundación ProAves). Extensive exploration could not relocate the birds but, just as efforts were drawing to a close, the project team visited the remote Cucuana valley in the Central Andes of Tolima. There, on 18 April 1999, Yellow-eared Parrots were found once again. A total of 81 birds was count, including a breeding pair on a nest at the site. There was hope after all!



Yellow-eared Parrot is dependent on wax palms for nesting and feeding (Fundación ProAves).

The Proyecto Ognorhynchus team immediately launched a conservation programme to study and protect the species, gathering a wealth of information on the parrot's ecology and natural history. It became clear that Yellow-eared Parrot was an exceptionally social and strongly bonding species, dispersing from the wax palm roost sites at first light, gradually returning and arriving back at the roost sites by mid- to late-afternoon. Both parrot and wax palm faced multiple major threats, such as hunting for food and sport, habitat loss and complete lack of protected areas where the species occurred, lack of nest-site availability because dead standing wax palms were cut down by farmers, and overharvesting of wax palm fronds for Palm Sunday by felling wax palm stands. With these identified, the team formulated a conservation strategy, and its implementation has been fully supported by Loro Parque Fundación, which has to date donated US$1,611,444.

The project sought permission to work at the newly discovered colony, located within a stronghold of FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) guerrillas and a zone for confrontations with the National Army of Colombia. FARC declared that any person who killed a Yellow-eared Parrot could face death. Unsurprisingly, local inhabitants strictly adhered to the ban so that the threat from hunting stopped immediately, and thereafter the ProAves team had no evidence of a parrot being harmed.

A major obstacle was lack of enforcement of wax palm protection, and by the 1990s the core populations were restricted to 12 sites in Colombia (and four in northern Peru). Wax palms develop slowly, not reaching maturity until 75 years or more old. In the Cucuana valley, sporadic pastures have stands of uniformly mature wax palms of almost 100 years and more than 20 m tall. Their height makes them ideal nesting sites for parrots, being largely inaccessible to terrestrial predators. However, cattle grazing of palm seedlings results in almost zero recruitment. Research by ProAves showed that standing dead palm trunks were scarce, causing a lack of suitable nest sites to form a colony. From the Cucuana flock of 81 birds, just one chick fledged in 1999 from a 20-m dead and hollow palm. To address these problems, ProAves sought the collaboration of local farmers to change farming methods. Once the rural community was made aware that the fate of the parrot and palm was in its hands, that knowledge triggered an extraordinary positive response from farmers and the wider community.



In many areas, intensive cattle grazing below wax palms has resulted in no new trees growing to replace those dying or cut down (A Advent).

No more dead palms were cut down and project staff helped farmers to protect forest patches from cattle. A palm nursery was established by the project to grow seedlings and plant a future generation in secure locations. Within just a few years, Yellow-eared Parrot breeding activities and reproductive success rates drastically increased. Furthermore, the project developed one of the first artificial nestbox campaigns in the Neotropics to supplement natural sites. Using wood shaped and painted as palm trunks, nestboxes were mounted on live palms. The parrots' use of the boxes was slow at first, but later deployment in new colonies with limited dead palms proved more successful. The most fruitful technique to facilitate nest availability was to cut a small hole halfway up the side of a recently dead palm. Parrots readily took to these palms and breeding productivity accelerated. Within just three years the breeding colony grew, fledging 93 young in 2002, with two back-to-back nesting seasons per year. The fledgling recruitment success rate averaged 64% for all breeding pairs. Of successful nests, an average 55% of nests fledged one chick, 31% fledged two chicks and 14% fledged three chicks.

Yellow-eared Parrot feeds on more than 18 different fruiting trees, regularly changing routes to seasonal sources of fruit, but predominately eats only six plant species. With 89% of montane cloudforests in the region having been cleared, mainly for cattle pasture, and the last surviving forests of the Cucuana and Cucuanita valleys totally unprotected, habitat protection was the next focus for the project. While LPF continued its support of all ongoing project activities, in 2009 the Rainforest Trust and the American Bird Conservancy helped with the purchase of private properties to establish the 3,998-ha Loros Andinos Bird Reserve in Tolima. The 189-ha Loro Orejiamarillo Bird Reserve was also established in Jardín, Antioquia, to create a base of conservation efforts for this new population. Furthermore, private property owners in the Cucuana valley were willing to enrol in a land stewardship scheme to set aside land for regeneration and reforestation.



With a shortage of suitable dead palms available, nestboxes were mounted on living palms in order to provide more opportunities for the parrots to nest (Fundación ProAves).

Palm Sunday is widely observed across the Andes of Colombia. In Jardín alone in 2001, 200-300 wax palms were cut down to secure the four or five ;innermost emerging fronds used in the Palm Sunday procession. Wax palms were decimated ahead of each Holy Week, presenting perhaps the single biggest long-term threat to the survival of both parrot and palm. However, the project succeeded in convincing several priests in rural villages to stop using wax palms. ProAves helped by providing hundreds of wax palm seedlings for parishioners to carry in the processions with the message to plant them at home. This was largely a success, with only a few wax palm fronds used.

From 2002, ProAves and Conservation International-Colombia united with regional environmental corporations across Colombia to form a major national awareness campaign, called 'Reconcile with Nature'. This immediately gained media attention, with a free TV advertisement on the palm and parrot repeated on national TV channels before and during Holy Week for several years. The attention galvanised authorities to enforce the law and then, in 2004, the Cardinal of the Catholic church of Colombia instigated a nationwide ban on using wax palms in Palm Sunday processions, which from that moment celebrated nature and life.

To sustain the momentum, ProAves in partnership with governmental organisations sent the 'Loro Bus', a mobile environmental classroom, to reach hundreds of remote rural schools and communities across the Andes. For almost five years the bus toured the Andes educating and involving an average of 2,600 children and 400 adults per month. Saving wax palms and Yellow-eared Parrot was the new tradition, embraced and institutionalised across all generations of Colombians.



A 'Parrot and Palm' festival takes place in Colombia (Fundación ProAves).

How has the Yellow-eared Parrot population responded? In addition to 93 chicks fledging successfully by 2002, a second breeding population was located in the Western Andes between Jardin and Rio Sucio, 96 miles directly north of the Cucuana valley. This marked the beginning of the species recolonising areas with wax palms from the two source populations. By 2010, the population had risen to 1,103 – although only 106 breeding pairs were active – and by 2013, there were 1,408. A national parrot census was organised by ProAves in December 2018, simultaneously conducted at 41 sites in the Western, Central and Eastern Cordilleras, and confirmed 2,250 individuals. A repeat census in April 2019 surveyed 12 locations and documented 2,601 individuals, including 998 in Roncesvalles (a 13-fold increase since 1999). The April count is deemed most accurate as it was undertaken when most individuals congregate at roosts in the breeding colonies. Yellow-eared Parrot's continued recovery has warranted a downgrade of the species' IUCN status to Near-threatened. Flocks have already expanded southward to within 68 miles of wax palms in Ecuador, where the species' return is imminently expected.

Two decades of an intensive, multifaceted, science-driven conservation effort initiated by Fundación ProAves, with 20 years of major support from Loro Parque Fundación, have resulted in the most successful recovery of a species on the brink of extinction in the Americas. Many other individuals, organisations and entities also deserve gratitude for supporting the initiative to make a difference. Last but not least, thanks are due to the people of Colombia – the dire plight of both parrot and palm united a nation to work collaboratively, to make changes and give nature hope.",Yellow-eared Parrot: how conservation united a nation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpcmRndWlkZXMuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2NvbnNlcnZhdGlvbi95ZWxsb3ctZWFyZWQtcGFycm90LWhvdy1jb25zZXJ2YXRpb24tdW5pdGVkLWEtbmF0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://www.birdguides-cdn.com/cdn/articles/9-Ognorhynchus-at-cut-entrance-to-nest_ProAves.jpg?&width=1200&height=630&mode=crop,2019-11-19,"{'sent': '16d4f50d-8889', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['16d4f50d-8889']}}","16d4f50d-8889-40d7-a9d6-0fdec737d838

With these identified, the team formulated a conservation strategy, and its implementation has been fully supported by Loro Parque Fundación, which has to date donated US$1,611,444.

The project sought permission to work at the newly discovered colony, located within a stronghold of FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia) guerrillas and a zone for confrontations with the National Army of Colombia. FARC declared that any person who killed a Yellow-eared Parrot could face death. Unsurprisingly, local inhabitants strictly adhered to the ban so that the threat from hunting stopped immediately, and thereafter the ProAves team had no evidence of a parrot being harmed.

A major obstacle was lack of enforcement of wax palm protection, and by the 1990s the core populations were restricted to 12 sites in Colombia (and four in northern Peru). Wax palms develop slowly, not reaching maturity until 75 years or more old. In the Cucuana valley, sporadic pastures have stands of uniformly mature wax palms of almost 100 years and more than 20 m tall. Their height makes them ideal nesting sites for parrots, being largely inaccessible to terrestrial predators. However, cattle grazing of palm seedlings results in almost zero recruitment. Research by ProAves showed that standing dead palm trunks were scarce, causing a lack of suitable nest sites to form a colony. From the Cucuana flock of 81 birds, just one chick fledged in 1999 from a 20-m dead and hollow palm. To address these problems, ProAves sought the collaboration of local farmers to change farming methods. Once the rural community was made aware that the fate of the parrot and palm was in its hands, that knowledge triggered an extraordinary positive response from farmers and the wider community.



In many areas, intensive cattle grazing below wax palms has resulted in no new trees growing to replace those dying or cut down (A Advent).

No more dead palms were cut down and project staff helped farmers to protect forest patches from cattle. A palm nursery was established by the project to grow seedlings and plant a future generation in secure locations. Within just a few years, Yellow-eared Parrot breeding activities and reproductive success rates drastically increased. Furthermore, the project developed one of the first artificial nestbox campaigns in the Neotropics to supplement natural sites. Using wood shaped and painted as palm trunks, nestboxes were mounted on live palms. The parrots' use of the boxes was slow at first, but later deployment in new colonies with limited dead palms proved more successful. The most fruitful technique to facilitate nest availability was to cut a small hole halfway up the side of a recently dead palm. Parrots readily took to these palms and breeding productivity accelerated. Within just three years the breeding colony grew, fledging 93 young in 2002, with two back-to-back nesting seasons per year. The fledgling recruitment success rate averaged 64% for all breeding pairs. Of successful nests, an average 55% of nests fledged one chick, 31% fledged two chicks and 14% fledged three chicks.

Yellow-eared Parrot feeds on more than 18 different fruiting trees, regularly changing routes to seasonal sources of fruit, but predominately eats only six plant species. With 89% of montane cloudforests in the region having been cleared, mainly for cattle pasture, and the last surviving forests of the Cucuana and Cucuanita valleys totally unprotected, habitat protection was the next focus for the project. While LPF continued its support of all ongoing project activities, in 2009 the Rainforest Trust and the American Bird Conservancy helped with the purchase of private properties to establish the 3,998-ha Loros Andinos Bird Reserve in Tolima. The 189-ha Loro Orejiamarillo Bird Reserve was also established in Jardín, Antioquia, to create a base of conservation efforts for this new population. Furthermore, private property owners in the Cucuana valley were willing to enrol in a land stewardship scheme to set aside land for regeneration and reforestation.



With a shortage of suitable dead palms available, nestboxes were mounted on living palms in order to provide more opportunities for the parrots to nest (Fundación ProAves).

Palm Sunday is widely observed across the Andes of Colombia. In Jardín alone in 2001, 200-300 wax palms were cut down to secure the four or five ;innermost emerging fronds used in the Palm Sunday procession. Wax palms were decimated ahead of each Holy Week, presenting perhaps the single biggest long-term threat to the survival of both parrot and palm. However, the project succeeded in convincing several priests in rural villages to stop using wax palms. ProAves helped by providing hundreds of wax palm seedlings for parishioners to carry in the processions with the message to plant them at home. This was largely a success, with only a few wax palm fronds used.

From 2002, ProAves and Conservation International-Colombia united with regional environmental corporations across Colombia to form a major national awareness campaign, called 'Reconcile with Nature'. This immediately gained media attention, with a free TV advertisement on the palm and parrot repeated on national TV channels before and during Holy Week for several years. The attention galvanised authorities to enforce the law and then, in 2004, the Cardinal of the Catholic church of Colombia instigated a nationwide ban on using wax palms in Palm Sunday processions, which from that moment celebrated nature and life.

To sustain the momentum, ProAves in partnership with governmental organisations sent the 'Loro Bus', a mobile environmental classroom, to reach hundreds of remote rural schools and communities across the Andes. For almost five years the bus toured the Andes educating and involving an average of 2,600 children and 400 adults per month. Saving wax palms and Yellow-eared Parrot was the new tradition, embraced and institutionalised across all generations of Colombians.



A 'Parrot and Palm' festival takes place in Colombia (Fundación ProAves).

How has the Yellow-eared Parrot population responded? In addition to 93 chicks fledging successfully by 2002, a second breeding population was located in the Western Andes between Jardin and Rio Sucio, 96 miles directly north of the Cucuana valley. This marked the beginning of the species recolonising areas with wax palms from the two source populations. By 2010, the population had risen to 1,103 – although only 106 breeding pairs were active – and by 2013, there were 1,408. A national parrot census was organised by ProAves in December 2018, simultaneously conducted at 41 sites in the Western, Central and Eastern Cordilleras, and confirmed 2,250 individuals. A repeat census in April 2019 surveyed 12 locations and documented 2,601 individuals, including 998 in Roncesvalles (a 13-fold increase since 1999). The April count is deemed most accurate as it was undertaken when most individuals congregate at roosts in the breeding colonies. Yellow-eared Parrot's continued recovery has warranted a downgrade of the species' IUCN status to Near-threatened. Flocks have already expanded southward to within 68 miles of wax palms in Ecuador, where the species' return is imminently expected.

Two decades of an intensive, multifaceted, science-driven conservation effort initiated by Fundación ProAves, with 20 years of major support from Loro Parque Fundación, have resulted in the most successful recovery of a species on the brink of extinction in the Americas. Many other individuals, organisations and entities also deserve gratitude for supporting the initiative to make a difference. Last but not least, thanks are due to the people of Colombia – the dire plight of both parrot and palm united a nation to work collaboratively, to make changes and give nature hope.","[{'DATE', 'This

With winter approaching, hundreds of millions of migratory birds around the globe are moving southward again seeking a warmer habitat, a seasonal phenomenon creating spectacular views that can take your breath away.

However, it is also the season when bird hunters make illegal catches.

Volunteers with the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation have recently discovered migratory birds poisoned on some migrant routes across China.

On Nov 14, five migratory birds, including three wild ducks and two common moorhens, were found poisoned to death in Hanjiang River, Hubei province.

According to Zhou, the head of a migratory bird sanctuary in the Hanjiang River basin, those criminals usually hide poison in the preferred habitats of migratory birds and wait for the birds to swallow it. Then they will catch birds that are left behind or dead.

When the peak season for migration arrives, apart from paying attention to illegal fishing, he and volunteers also keep a close eye on the migratory birds that flocked to the riverside.

On Nov 19, an oriental white stork, a first-class national protected species, was found poisoned to death in Caofeidian, North China's Hebei province.

Over 2,000 oriental white storks have come to the Caofeidian wetlands this year, the volunteers said, although the exact number of birds poisoned to death remained unknown.

There are eight migration routes around the globe, three of which pass through China, namely, the East Africa-West Asia (West Line), Central Asia-India (Middle Line), and East Asia-Australia (East Line).

The longest is the East Asia-Australia route, which extends more than 12,000 kilometers and covers 22 provinces in China. It is also along this line that the hunting of migratory birds occurs the most.

The volunteers hope stricter punishment could be imposed on bird killers to prevent such tragedies from happening again and again.","Birds poisoned, killed during migration",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoaW5hZGFpbHkuY29tLmNuL2EvMjAxOTExLzIxL1dTNWRkNjJmNzFhMzEwY2YzZTM1NTc5MDdiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201911/21/5dd62f71a310cf3e97a7a4b9.jpeg,2019-11-21,"{'sent': ""An oriental white stork found dead at a riverside in Caofeidian, Tangshan, North China's Hebei province."", 'ents': {'GPE': ['Caofeidian', 'Hebei province', 'Tangshan', ""North China's""]}}","An oriental white stork found dead at a riverside in Caofeidian, Tangshan, North China's Hebei province.

Or you're at dinner and your kid stuns you with an awesome piece of trivia they learned in school. However it happens, these moments spark our curiosity and keep our minds fresh. Plus, having a few fun fascinating facts in your back pocket means you'll never be stuck in an awkward conversation again.

To help freshen up your arsenal of factoids, we've rounded up some truly inspiring facts that'll blow your mind. From the number of inches a piece of bamboo can grow in a day to how much your blood weighs, these curious tidbits are sure to pique your interest!

1 Costco sells enough toilet paper per year to wrap around the world 1,200 times.

Every Costco lover knows that the big-box retailer is the ideal place to load up on everything from dog food and paper towels to socks and margarita mix. But according to CNBC, toilet paper is the store's crown jewel: Costco sells about one billion rolls of toilet paper a year. That's enough to wrap around the planet 1,200 times!

2 Nomophobia is the fear of not having a mobile phone.

People are increasingly reliant on their devices these days, but for some, the attachment can develop into a serious issue. Those with nomophobia—an abbreviation of ""no-mobile-phone phobia""—have a fear of not having their phone on them. They get equally freaked out when their battery dies or when there's no network coverage available. One 2019 study by U.K. firm YouGov found that 34 percent of men and 52 percent of women currently deal with some form of the condition.

3 Ladybugs defend themselves by bleeding from their knees.

Ladybugs are seemingly sweet little creatures, but they also have a rather nasty way of defending themselves. When threatened, they release a foul-smelling chemical from their knees that has the ability to repulse predators. The substance, which is hemolymph made up of a mix of alkaloids, can also ooze from their abdomens, according to the San Diego Zoo.

Fortunately, ladybugs have another defense mechanism, too: their color. ""Predators learn that color combinations of bright oranges, reds, and blacks can mean an unappetizing taste, and they avoid eating the ladybugs,"" the experts at the San Diego Zoo note.

4 The tiniest snail ever discovered could fit through a needle's eye 10 times.

Snails are known for their impressive shells and slimy trails, but the Angustopila dominikae snail has also made headlines for being incredibly tiny. These itty-bitty creatures, which were discovered in 2014, are just 0.03 inches (or 0.86 millimeters) tall. That means that 10 of them could fit in the eye of a needle at one time!

5 You have a one in 1,461 chance of being born on leap day.

Are you a leap day baby? We'd put our money on no. Due to the fact that Feb. 29 only comes around once every four years, having this birthday is incredibly rare. In fact, a person has a one in 1,461 chance of being born then. According to Vox, that's because there are 1,460 days in four years, plus one for the leap year, totaling 1,461.

6 A growlery is a place where you go to be alone when you're cranky.

Are you having a bad day? Then you might need to visit a growlery. This term was first used by author Charles Dickens in his 1853 novel Bleak House to refer to a place where you go to be alone when you're not feeling particularly chipper. According to the National Park Service, Frederick Douglass had his own growlery outside of his home at Cedar Hill in Washington, D.C. The stone cabin contained a single room with a fireplace, desk, stool, and couch.

7 The longest one-syllable words in the English language all start with the letter ""s.""

A monosyllabic word has just one syllable. And while plenty of monosyllabic words exist, the longest ones all happen to start with the letter ""s,"" according to Guinness World Records. At 10 letters, ""scraunched"" and ""strengthed"" are the longest monosyllabic words in the English language. ""Screeched,"" ""scrounged,"" ""squelched,"" ""straights,"" and ""strengths"" come in second place with nine letters each.

8 Bamboo grows so fast, it's measured in miles per hour.

Along with being strong and flexible, bamboo can be grown as a decorative plant or a practical crop. And bamboo is also a fabulously renewable resource. In fact, it's the fastest growing plant on the planet, capable of shooting up 35 inches each day at a rate of 0.00002 miles per hour, according to Guinness World Records.

9 A narluga is a cross between a narwhal and a beluga whale.

In the 1990s, researchers found a strange skull displayed on the roof of a hunter's house in western Greenland. While they knew the bony structure belonged to a whale, they weren't sure what kind of whale it was. Almost 30 years later, scientists have determined that the unusual creature was a cross between a narwhal and a beluga whale, which they deemed a narluga.

10 The Last Supper originally showed Jesus' feet, but they were cut off to make a doorway.

Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the last supper is one of the most famous works of art in the world. It also used to include the central figure's feet, but they were cut off when a door was installed in the wall beneath the fresco in 1652.

11 Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't have a number for zero.

If you learned Roman numerals in school, then you might've realized you were never taught the number for zero—and that's because there isn't one. While the ancient Romans (and Greeks) were fully aware of the concept of having nothing, they skipped over zero when it came to numbers. In fact, Aristotle himself is said to have dismissed the number because you couldn't divide it and get a reasonable answer, according to The Guardian.

12 Caesar salad was invented in Mexico by an Italian-American man.

Caesar salad sounds like an item that was inspired by Julius Caesar in Rome. But the truth is that it was named after the man who invented it in 1924—Italian-American restaurateur Caesar Cardini—not its place of origin, which was actually Tijuana, Mexico. According to Food & Wine, Cardini moved to the city (which is close to the California border) to escape the confines of prohibition. Cardini developed the simple salad during the Fourth of July rush in 1924 with the only ingredients he had left.

13 Nobody knows how to open the entire vault at Fort Knox.

Kentucky's Fort Knox is one of the most secure places in the country, due to the fact that it's home to more than 147.3 million ounces of gold bullion, according to the U.S. Mint. During World War II, it even stored the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. So obviously, there are strict precautions when it comes to access. For instance, there are very few people who are aware of the actual structure of the facility, and there's not one single person who knows all of the procedures to open the vault entirely.

14 The U.S. went from having two species of parrots to more than 50.

Although the contiguous United States used to have only two parrot species, the Carolina parakeet and the thick-billed parrot, there are now 56 different parrot species in the wilderness of 43 states. Twenty-five of those species have been breeding in 23 states, according to a 2019 study published in the Journal of Ornithology.

""Many of them were escaped pets, or their owners released them because they couldn't train them or they made too much noise—all the reasons people let pets go,"" researcher Stephen Pruett-Jones said in a statement. ""But many of these species are perfectly happy living here, and they've established populations. Wild parrots are here to stay.""

15 Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a condition that makes people feel larger or smaller than they actually are.

Anyone who knows the story of Alice in Wonderland is aware of the magical moments when the central character shrinks and grows in size. And while those with the rare Alice in Wonderland syndrome don't actually shape-shift, they do have temporary episodes that make them feel larger or smaller. The spans of distorted perception can also make it seem like things around them are moving further away or closer.

16 The melting snow and ice on Japan's ""Dragon Eye"" pond create the illusion of a giant eye.

Near the summit of Mount Hachimantai, Kagami Pond provides a wondrous sight from the end of May to the beginning of June. When the snow and ice begin to melt on the surface of the water, it creates a shape that looks like a giant blue dragon's eye.

17 Miss Piggy was originally named Piggy Lee.

Miss Piggy has been a fan favorite ever since she made her debut on The Muppet Show in 1976. But it turns out that before she was introduced to the world, she went by another name. In 2014, Time reported that a 40-year-old note and a pair of photos from the character's creator, Jim Henson, showed that Miss Piggy's name was initially ""Piggy Lee."" Although we know that she famously fell for Kermit the Frog, in the photos she's seen with a character named Hamilton Pigg. Poor Kermie!

18 There's an entire holiday dedicated to what would happen if cats and dogs had opposable thumbs.

Have you ever wondered what your pet would be capable of if they had more practical paws? You can spend 24 hours thinking about just that on Mar. 3, which is ""What If Cats and Dogs Had Opposable Thumbs Day."" Days of the Year asks you to ""imagine a world where our favorite furry companions had thumbs. Opposable ones. Thumbs that allowed them to open their own tins of food, easily steal your possessions, and generally make them more trouble than they already are. What kind of world would that be?"" We can definitely see the pros and cons.

19 The world's smallest McDonald's was designed for bees.

Unfortunately for hungry humans, there are no Big Macs or McNuggets available at the smallest McDonald's restaurant in the world. For bees, though, there is plenty of honey. The mini eating establishment was built in Sweden as part of the company's efforts to help restore the bee population. The hive—or rather, McHive—can not only house thousands of bees, but it's also shaped like a smaller version of the fast food joint—tiny golden arches and all.

20 When there's a double rainbow, the second rainbow mirrors the primary one.

It's always exciting to spot a rainbow—but it's even more thrilling to spot a double rainbow. Frankly, you may have been so captivated by the stunning occurrence that you failed to notice a wonderfully delightful detail: The second arch displays its colors in the opposite order of the primary rainbow!

21 Figs aren't considered vegan because they have dead wasps inside.

Anyone who sticks to a strictly plant-based diet will want to remove figs from their repertoire. While the figs themselves are fruit, they often include bugs. Vegan Life explains that a female ""wasp will enter the fig, passing into a part of the plant known as the calimyrna"" while trying to lay her eggs. ""Eventually, she dies… and is broken down by a protein-digesting enzyme inside the fig.""

22 We are born with only two innate fears.

While it might seem like you've been afraid of snakes and spiders since you were born, that's not totally true. According to CNN, scientists have found that humans have just two innate fears: the fear of falling and the fear of loud sounds. The rest of your phobias are learned over time.

23 ""Kangaroo words"" are words that contain their own synonyms.

A kangaroo word sounds like something that's spoken in Australia, but it's actually a word that happens to contain its own synonym, with the letters to spell it in the correct order. According to Dictionary.com, examples include the words ""chocolate"" (which includes the synonym ""cocoa""), ""masculine"" (""male""), ""blossom"" (""bloom""), ""chicken"" (""hen""), ""rambunctious"" (""raucous""), and ""deceased"" (""dead"").

24 Your blood makes up about eight percent of your body weight.

The human body contains everything from muscles and bones to organs and bacteria. But when it comes to your overall weight, you'd be silly not to consider your blood. Turns out, it makes up around eight percent of the number you see on the scale, according to the American Society of Hematology.

25 David Bowie launched an internet provider in the late 1990s.

David Bowie was a legendary songwriter and an iconic performer. And in the late 1990s, he was also an internet provider. He launched BowieNet in 1998 and the service remained available until the early 2000s. For $19.95 a month, users would receive an email address (yourname@davidbowie.com), 5MB of online storage meant for a personal web page, exclusive audio and video of Bowie, access to chat rooms (where Bowie would supposedly pop up on occasion), and even multiplayer games. Sounds far cooler than AOL.

26 A man set a world record by visiting an average of two bars every day for 55 years.

The U.K.'s Bruce Masters likes to treat himself to a pint or two so much that he set a Guinness World Record for the most pubs ever visited by a single person. Between 1960 and 2014, Masters spent time in 46,495 different drinking establishments. Cheers to that!

27 The oldest known lineage in North America goes back 55 generations.

DNA kits are making it easier than ever to trace our family histories. But in 2019, one man's results turned up something incredible. Montana's Darrell ""Dusty"" Crawford of the Blackfeet Nation did a home DNA test and learned that his lineage could be traced back 55 generations (that's more than 17,000 years!). The results also had a 99 percent accuracy rate, which is not always the case!

28 Hippos are only territorial in water.

Hippos (or hippopotamuses and hippopotami, if you want to be fancy) may look like adorable animals. But they can be rather fierce—deadly, even—especially when it comes to defending their home turf, or rather, their home river. That's because these mammals are only territorial when they're in the water, according to National Geographic. Here's to hoping you only encounter one on land!

29 Canada has more coastline than the four countries with the next-longest shores combined.

Canada is the second largest country in the world by total area. Although many of the nation's provinces are far from the beach, the country has the longest coastline in the world, totaling 125,566 miles. That's longer than the four countries with the next-longest shores combined: Norway's 36,122 miles, Indonesia's 34,001 miles, Greenland's 27,394 miles, and Russia's 23,396 miles. If you're walking at a pace of one mile every 20 minutes, it would take approximately 4.75 years to hike the entire length of the Canadian coastline.

30 Cruise ships have their own morgues.

When you take a cruise, you might be focused on the sunshine and the seawater. But those who run the ship have to consider the practical side of being out on the ocean for days at a time, and that includes what happens when someone passes away onboard. In order to deal with this unfortunate reality, most cruise ships have their own morgue that can accommodate multiple bodies.

31 The first motel charged $1.25 for a luxury bungalow.

While today's motels are notoriously bare bones, the first such establishment was a luxurious spot for motorists to take a break from their long journeys. The Milestone Mo-Tel Inn (Mo-Tel was shortened from ""motor hotel"") opened in 1925 in San Luis Obispo, California, and charged just $1.25 (what would be around $17 today) for a bungalow that included showers, central heating, a garage, and even rooms for chauffeurs, if needed.

32 The longest feather boa was nearly four times the height of the Empire State Building.

Feather boas are usually long enough to wrap around a person's shoulders. But during 2019's Pride celebration in New York City, Madame Tussauds New York and Ripley's Believe It or Not! Times Square set a Guinness World Record for the longest feather boa ever, stretching 1.2 miles. At that length, the boa was nearly four times the height of the Empire State Building! Drag queen Shangela of RuPaul's Drag Race and A Star Is Born emceed the unveiling event.

33 Your brain uses up around 20 percent of your body's blood and oxygen.

The human brain is responsible for countless tasks and is always busy keeping our internal systems running. In order to remain so vitally productive, the brain uses 20 percent of both the oxygen and the blood in your body, according to Healthline.

34 Ravens' moods are affected by others.

It's a well-known fact that ravens are wildly intelligent creatures. But 2019 research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences discovered that the birds are also very in tune with the feelings of the creatures around them. This empathetic trait had previously only been observed in primates.

35 Giraffes hum to each other at night to make sure their herd stays together.

If you're not already completely charmed by giraffes' incredibly long necks and stylish spots, then there's another sweet fact about the super tall creatures that might win you over. Although scientists had previously believed that the animals were either completely silent or made noises that humans were unable to hear, they recently learned that giraffes can hum—and humans can hear it, too.

In 2015, researchers from the University of Vienna gathered 947 hours of giraffe noises over an eight-year period at three zoos and they discovered that the animals produced a humming sound at night. The scientists hypothesize that the animals do this to help keep their herd together when their vision is impaired in the low light.

36 Pluto might have a liquid ocean under its icy surface.

Since it's so far away from the sun, Pluto was believed to be mostly covered in ice. But stunningly, even after billions of years in the frigid cold, there may still be a liquid ocean beneath that slick sheet. According to a 2019 study published in the journal Natural Geoscience, the ocean is capped and insulated by gas hydrates that might have prevented the entire body of water from freezing over.

37 Scents come off differently to individual people.

A rose by any other name may be as sweet, according to William Shakespeare, but a rose may not smell the same to you as it does to other people. According to a 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, differences in humans' genetic codes might mean that odors come off differently to individual people.

38 More people drown in fresh water than in salt water.

Did you know that the vast majority of drownings occur in fresh water? According to ThoughtCo, a staggering 90 percent of drownings take place in swimming pools, bathtubs, and rivers, not only because of circumstances but also because of the way the different types of water affect the human body in potentially fatal situations.

39 The British pound is the world's oldest currency still in use.

If you visit Britain and fork over some cash, then you should know that you're paying with the oldest still-in-use currency in the world. According to the World Economic Forum, the pound goes back more than 1,200 years, to 775 A.D. Back then, one unit of the currency was equivalent to a one-pound weight of silver. By the year 928, one pound could buy a person 15 cows.

40 You typically only breathe out of one nostril at a time.

You might think that your nostrils share the workload when it comes to taking in oxygen. And while they do, it's not quite in the way that you might expect. Instead of both taking in the same amount of air when you breathe, you actually inhale most of your oxygen through one nostril at a time. Every few hours, the active nostril will take a break and the other one will take over until they ultimately switch back again.

41 ""Vegetables"" don't really exist.

Professional chefs and home cooks may use the word ""vegetable"" to describe everything from asparagus and broccoli to zucchini and yams. But it turns out the term has no scientific value. When the BBC asked botanist Wolfgang Stuppy of the Royal Botanic Gardens if vegetables really exist, he answered, ""No, not botanically… the term vegetable doesn't exist in botanical terminology.""

42 Astronauts can now bake cookies in space.

Astronauts have to nosh on space-safe versions of the foods we eat on Earth. However, in fall 2019, the International Space Station tested out a space oven that will allow those aboard to bake cookies. Seriously, this dreamy device is specifically designed for the sugary treats!

According to Scientific American, ""When scientists investigated the potential psychological effects of long-term missions and deep-space travel, they found things would be more bearable if astronauts have access to a good variety of foods that smell and taste a little bit more like home."" What's more, former astronaut Mike Massimino explained that preparing food boosts morale by adding ""a sense of normalcy"" to astronauts' time away from Earth. Yep, even astronauts love the smell of fresh-baked cookies!

43 It takes nearly two days for a human to discharge a Lego through their body.

Anyone who's been around Legos knows that they're incredibly painful to step on. But have you ever wondered what happens when you swallow one? In a 2018 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics and Child Health, six volunteers decided to find out by ingesting a Lego figurine head (a piece that is much rounder and presumably easier on the digestive system than a rectangular one). The researchers determined that it takes an average of 1.71 days to pass a Lego through the human body.

44 There are Bonsai trees that produce oranges.

Bonsai trees are famous for their compact beauty, growing in shapely ways that artists and hobbyists take great care to nurture and tend. However, it's less well-known that there are Bonsai trees that actually produce oranges!

45 Lake Bled contains the only natural island in Slovenia.

If you want to enjoy island life in Slovenia, there's only one place you can go: Bled Island. The teardrop-shaped landmass is the only naturally occurring island in the entire European country. Not even a full acre in size, it's home to a picturesque 17th-century church and beautiful greenery, but not much else.

46 Shakespeare may have worn a gold hoop earring as a sign of his bohemian ways.

Shakespeare is most famous for his plays and poems, but he also had a signature sense of style. In a portrait attributed to the artist John Taylor (pictured here), Shakespeare can be seen with a full beard, casually loosened shirt-ties, and a gold hoop hanging from his left ear. And that gold hoop may have been more than just a spiffy fashion choice. He may have chosen the accessory to signal to others that he was a bohemian who lived a life filled with creativity instead of conformity. Viva la vie Bohème!

47 Neanderthals may have trapped golden eagles 130,000 years ago.

48 Americans spend an estimated $9 billion on Halloween each year.

If you like to go all out when Halloween rolls around with spooky decorations, creepy costumes, tons of candy, and elaborate parties, then you're definitely not alone. According to Forbes, Americans spent around $9 billion on Halloween in 2018 alone.

49 Hyenas may have lived in the Arctic during the last Ice Age.

Today, hyenas only live in Africa. However, that might not always have been the case. North of the Arctic Circle, the Yukon's Old Crow River region has turned up plenty of Ice Age fossils belonging to woolly mammoths, bison, horses, and even lions. And now, paleontologists have confirmed that two hyena teeth were found in the area; they estimate that they are between 850,000 and 1.4 million years old. ""It is absolutely remarkable that they lived that far north,"" researcher Grant Zazula told IFLScience.

Despite the fact that Beatrix Potter lived from 1866 to 1943, her books are still beloved among children and adults alike. Fans may know a few quirky facts about the author, but they might not know this strange tidbit: Throughout her teenage years, Potter kept a journal using a secret code (presumably to hide it from her mother).

Maybe you're reading the newspaper and an interesting statistic jumps out at you. Or you're at dinner and your kid stuns you with an awesome piece of trivia they learned in school. However it happens, these moments spark our curiosity and keep our minds fresh. Plus, having a few fun fascinating facts in your back pocket means you'll never be stuck in an awkward conversation again.

To help freshen up your arsenal of factoids, we've rounded up some truly inspiring facts that'll blow your mind. From the number of inches a piece of bamboo can grow in a day to how much your blood weighs, these curious tidbits are sure to pique your interest!

1 Costco sells enough toilet paper per year to wrap around the world 1,200 times.

Every Costco lover knows that the big-box retailer is the ideal place to load up on everything from dog food and paper towels to socks and margarita mix. But according to CNBC, toilet paper is the store's crown jewel: Costco sells about one billion rolls of toilet paper a year. That's enough to wrap around the planet 1,200 times!

2 Nomophobia is the fear of not having a mobile phone.

People are increasingly reliant on their devices these days, but for some, the attachment can develop into a serious issue. Those with nomophobia—an abbreviation of ""no-mobile-phone phobia""—have a fear of not having their phone on them. They get equally freaked out when their battery dies or when there's no network coverage available. One 2019 study by U.K. firm YouGov found that 34 percent of men and 52 percent of women currently deal with some form of the condition.

3 Ladybugs defend themselves by bleeding from their knees.

Ladybugs are seemingly sweet little creatures, but they also have a rather nasty way of defending themselves. When threatened, they release a foul-smelling chemical from their knees that has the ability to repulse predators. The substance, which is hemolymph made up of a mix of alkaloids, can also ooze from their abdomens, according to the San Diego Zoo.

Fortunately, ladybugs have another defense mechanism, too: their color. ""Predators learn that color combinations of bright oranges, reds, and blacks can mean an unappetizing taste, and they avoid eating the ladybugs,"" the experts at the San Diego Zoo note.

4 The tiniest snail ever discovered could fit through a needle's eye 10 times.

Snails are known for their impressive shells and slimy trails, but the Angustopila dominikae snail has also made headlines for being incredibly tiny. These itty-bitty creatures, which were discovered in 2014, are just 0.03 inches (or 0.86 millimeters) tall. That means that 10 of them could fit in the eye of a needle at one time!

5 You have a one in 1,461 chance of being born on leap day.

Are you a leap day baby? We'd put our money on no. Due to the fact that Feb. 29 only comes around once every four years, having this birthday is incredibly rare. In fact, a person has a one in 1,461 chance of being born then. According to Vox, that's because there are 1,460 days in four years, plus one for the leap year, totaling 1,461.

6 A growlery is a place where you go to be alone when you're cranky.

Are you having a bad day? Then you might need to visit a growlery. This term was first used by author Charles Dickens in his 1853 novel Bleak House to refer to a place where you go to be alone when you're not feeling particularly chipper. According to the National Park Service, Frederick Douglass had his own growlery outside of his home at Cedar Hill in Washington, D.C. The stone cabin contained a single room with a fireplace, desk, stool, and couch.

7 The longest one-syllable words in the English language all start with the letter ""s.""

A monosyllabic word has just one syllable. And while plenty of monosyllabic words exist, the longest ones all happen to start with the letter ""s,"" according to Guinness World Records. At 10 letters, ""scraunched"" and ""strengthed"" are the longest monosyllabic words in the English language. ""Screeched,"" ""scrounged,"" ""squelched,"" ""straights,"" and ""strengths"" come in second place with nine letters each.

8 Bamboo grows so fast, it's measured in miles per hour.

Along with being strong and flexible, bamboo can be grown as a decorative plant or a practical crop. And bamboo is also a fabulously renewable resource. In fact, it's the fastest growing plant on the planet, capable of shooting up 35 inches each day at a rate of 0.00002 miles per hour, according to Guinness World Records.

9 A narluga is a cross between a narwhal and a beluga whale.

In the 1990s, researchers found a strange skull displayed on the roof of a hunter's house in western Greenland. While they knew the bony structure belonged to a whale, they weren't sure what kind of whale it was. Almost 30 years later, scientists have determined that the unusual creature was a cross between a narwhal and a beluga whale, which they deemed a narluga.

10 The Last Supper originally showed Jesus' feet, but they were cut off to make a doorway.

Leonardo Da Vinci's painting of the last supper is one of the most famous works of art in the world. It also used to include the central figure's feet, but they were cut off when a door was installed in the wall beneath the fresco in 1652.

11 Ancient Greeks and Romans didn't have a number for zero.

If you learned Roman numerals in school, then you might've realized you were never taught the number for zero—and that's because there isn't one. While the ancient Romans (and Greeks) were fully aware of the concept of having nothing, they skipped over zero when it came to numbers. In fact, Aristotle himself is said to have dismissed the number because you couldn't divide it and get a reasonable answer, according to The Guardian.

12 Caesar salad was invented in Mexico by an Italian-American man.

Caesar salad sounds like an item that was inspired by Julius Caesar in Rome. But the truth is that it was named after the man who invented it in 1924—Italian-American restaurateur Caesar Cardini—not its place of origin, which was actually Tijuana, Mexico. According to Food & Wine, Cardini moved to the city (which is close to the California border) to escape the confines of prohibition. Cardini developed the simple salad during the Fourth of July rush in 1924 with the only ingredients he had left.

13 Nobody knows how to open the entire vault at Fort Knox.

Kentucky's Fort Knox is one of the most secure places in the country, due to the fact that it's home to more than 147.3 million ounces of gold bullion, according to the U.S. Mint. During World War II, it even stored the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. So obviously, there are strict precautions when it comes to access. For instance, there are very few people who are aware of the actual structure of the facility, and there's not one single person who knows all of the procedures to open the vault entirely.

14 The U.S. went from having two species of parrots to more than 50.

Although the contiguous United States used to have only two parrot species, the Carolina parakeet and the thick-billed parrot, there are now 56 different parrot species in the wilderness of 43 states. Twenty-five of those species have been breeding in 23 states, according to a 2019 study published in the Journal of Ornithology.

""Many of them were escaped pets, or their owners released them because they couldn't train them or they made too much noise—all the reasons people let pets go,"" researcher Stephen Pruett-Jones said in a statement. ""But many of these species are perfectly happy living here, and they've established populations. Wild parrots are here to stay.""

15 Alice in Wonderland syndrome is a condition that makes people feel larger or smaller than they actually are.

Anyone who knows the story of Alice in Wonderland is aware of the magical moments when the central character shrinks and grows in size. And while those with the rare Alice in Wonderland syndrome don't actually shape-shift, they do have temporary episodes that make them feel larger or smaller. The spans of distorted perception can also make it seem like things around them are moving further away or closer.

16 The melting snow and ice on Japan's ""Dragon Eye"" pond create the illusion of a giant eye.

Near the summit of Mount Hachimantai, Kagami Pond provides a wondrous sight from the end of May to the beginning of June. When the snow and ice begin to melt on the surface of the water, it creates a shape that looks like a giant blue dragon's eye.

17 Miss Piggy was originally named Piggy Lee.

Miss Piggy has been a fan favorite ever since she made her debut on The Muppet Show in 1976. But it turns out that before she was introduced to the world, she went by another name. In 2014, Time reported that a 40-year-old note and a pair of photos from the character's creator, Jim Henson, showed that Miss Piggy's name was initially ""Piggy Lee."" Although we know that she famously fell for Kermit the Frog, in the photos she's seen with a character named Hamilton Pigg. Poor Kermie!

18 There's an entire holiday dedicated to what would happen if cats and dogs had opposable thumbs.

Have you ever wondered what your pet would be capable of if they had more practical paws? You can spend 24 hours thinking about just that on Mar. 3, which is ""What If Cats and Dogs Had Opposable Thumbs Day."" Days of the Year asks you to ""imagine a world where our favorite furry companions had thumbs. Opposable ones. Thumbs that allowed them to open their own tins of food, easily steal your possessions, and generally make them more trouble than they already are. What kind of world would that be?"" We can definitely see the pros and cons.

19 The world's smallest McDonald's was designed for bees.

Unfortunately for hungry humans, there are no Big Macs or McNuggets available at the smallest McDonald's restaurant in the world. For bees, though, there is plenty of honey. The mini eating establishment was built in Sweden as part of the company's efforts to help restore the bee population. The hive—or rather, McHive—can not only house thousands of bees, but it's also shaped like a smaller version of the fast food joint—tiny golden arches and all.

20 When there's a double rainbow, the second rainbow mirrors the primary one.

It's always exciting to spot a rainbow—but it's even more thrilling to spot a double rainbow. Frankly, you may have been so captivated by the stunning occurrence that you failed to notice a wonderfully delightful detail: The second arch displays its colors in the opposite order of the primary rainbow!

21 Figs aren't considered vegan because they have dead wasps inside.

Anyone who sticks to a strictly plant-based diet will want to remove figs from their repertoire. While the figs themselves are fruit, they often include bugs. Vegan Life explains that a female ""wasp will enter the fig, passing into a part of the plant known as the calimyrna"" while trying to lay her eggs. ""Eventually, she dies… and is broken down by a protein-digesting enzyme inside the fig.""

22 We are born with only two innate fears.

While it might seem like you've been afraid of snakes and spiders since you were born, that's not totally true. According to CNN, scientists have found that humans have just two innate fears: the fear of falling and the fear of loud sounds. The rest of your phobias are learned over time.

23 ""Kangaroo words"" are words that contain their own synonyms.

A kangaroo word sounds like something that's spoken in Australia, but it's actually a word that happens to contain its own synonym, with the letters to spell it in the correct order. According to Dictionary.com, examples include the words ""chocolate"" (which includes the synonym ""cocoa""), ""masculine"" (""male""), ""blossom"" (""bloom""), ""chicken"" (""hen""), ""rambunctious"" (""raucous""), and ""deceased"" (""dead"").

24 Your blood makes up about eight percent of your body weight.

The human body contains everything from muscles and bones to organs and bacteria. But when it comes to your overall weight, you'd be silly not to consider your blood. Turns out, it makes up around eight percent of the number you see on the scale, according to the American Society of Hematology.

25 David Bowie launched an internet provider in the late 1990s.

David Bowie was a legendary songwriter and an iconic performer. And in the late 1990s, he was also an internet provider. He launched BowieNet in 1998 and the service remained available until the early 2000s. For $19.95 a month, users would receive an email address (yourname@davidbowie.com), 5MB of online storage meant for a personal web page, exclusive audio and video of Bowie, access to chat rooms (where Bowie would supposedly pop up on occasion), and even multiplayer games. Sounds far cooler than AOL.

26 A man set a world record by visiting an average of two bars every day for 55 years.

The U.K.'s Bruce Masters likes to treat himself to a pint or two so much that he set a Guinness World Record for the most pubs ever visited by a single person. Between 1960 and 2014, Masters spent time in 46,495 different drinking establishments. Cheers to that!

27 The oldest known lineage in North America goes back 55 generations.

DNA kits are making it easier than ever to trace our family histories. But in 2019, one man's results turned up something incredible. Montana's Darrell ""Dusty"" Crawford of the Blackfeet Nation did a home DNA test and learned that his lineage could be traced back 55 generations (that's more than 17,000 years!). The results also had a 99 percent accuracy rate, which is not always the case!

28 Hippos are only territorial in water.

Hippos (or hippopotamuses and hippopotami, if you want to be fancy) may look like adorable animals. But they can be rather fierce—deadly, even—especially when it comes to defending their home turf, or rather, their home river. That's because these mammals are only territorial when they're in the water, according to National Geographic. Here's to hoping you only encounter one on land!

29 Canada has more coastline than the four countries with the next-longest shores combined.

Canada is the second largest country in the world by total area. Although many of the nation's provinces are far from the beach, the country has the longest coastline in the world, totaling 125,566 miles. That's longer than the four countries with the next-longest shores combined: Norway's 36,122 miles, Indonesia's 34,001 miles, Greenland's 27,394 miles, and Russia's 23,396 miles. If you're walking at a pace of one mile every 20 minutes, it would take approximately 4.75 years to hike the entire length of the Canadian coastline.

30 Cruise ships have their own morgues.

When you take a cruise, you might be focused on the sunshine and the seawater. But those who run the ship have to consider the practical side of being out on the ocean for days at a time, and that includes what happens when someone passes away onboard. In order to deal with this unfortunate reality, most cruise ships have their own morgue that can accommodate multiple bodies.

31 The first motel charged $1.25 for a luxury bungalow.

While today's motels are notoriously bare bones, the first such establishment was a luxurious spot for motorists to take a break from their long journeys. The Milestone Mo-Tel Inn (Mo-Tel was shortened from ""motor hotel"") opened in 1925 in San Luis Obispo, California, and charged just $1.25 (what would be around $17 today) for a bungalow that included showers, central heating, a garage, and even rooms for chauffeurs, if needed.

32 The longest feather boa was nearly four times the height of the Empire State Building.

Feather boas are usually long enough to wrap around a person's shoulders. But during 2019's Pride celebration in New York City, Madame Tussauds New York and Ripley's Believe It or Not! Times Square set a Guinness World Record for the longest feather boa ever, stretching 1.2 miles. At that length, the boa was nearly four times the height of the Empire State Building! Drag queen Shangela of RuPaul's Drag Race and A Star Is Born emceed the unveiling event.

33 Your brain uses up around 20 percent of your body's blood and oxygen.

The human brain is responsible for countless tasks and is always busy keeping our internal systems running. In order to remain so vitally productive, the brain uses 20 percent of both the oxygen and the blood in your body, according to Healthline.

34 Ravens' moods are affected by others.

It's a well-known fact that ravens are wildly intelligent creatures. But 2019 research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences discovered that the birds are also very in tune with the feelings of the creatures around them. This empathetic trait had previously only been observed in primates.

35 Giraffes hum to each other at night to make sure their herd stays together.

If you're not already completely charmed by giraffes' incredibly long necks and stylish spots, then there's another sweet fact about the super tall creatures that might win you over. Although scientists had previously believed that the animals were either completely silent or made noises that humans were unable to hear, they recently learned that giraffes can hum—and humans can hear it, too.

In 2015, researchers from the University of Vienna gathered 947 hours of giraffe noises over an eight-year period at three zoos and they discovered that the animals produced a humming sound at night. The scientists hypothesize that the animals do this to help keep their herd together when their vision is impaired in the low light.

36 Pluto might have a liquid ocean under its icy surface.

Since it's so far away from the sun, Pluto was believed to be mostly covered in ice. But stunningly, even after billions of years in the frigid cold, there may still be a liquid ocean beneath that slick sheet. According to a 2019 study published in the journal Natural Geoscience, the ocean is capped and insulated by gas hydrates that might have prevented the entire body of water from freezing over.

37 Scents come off differently to individual people.

A rose by any other name may be as sweet, according to William Shakespeare, but a rose may not smell the same to you as it does to other people. According to a 2019 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, differences in humans' genetic codes might mean that odors come off differently to individual people.

38 More people drown in fresh water than in salt water.

Did you know that the vast majority of drownings occur in fresh water? According to ThoughtCo, a staggering 90 percent of drownings take place in swimming pools, bathtubs, and rivers, not only because of circumstances but also because of the way the different types of water affect the human body in potentially fatal situations.

39 The British pound is the world's oldest currency still in use.

If you visit Britain and fork over some cash, then you should know that you're paying with the oldest still-in-use currency in the world. According to the World Economic Forum, the pound goes back more than 1,200 years, to 775 A.D. Back then, one unit of the currency was equivalent to a one-pound weight of silver. By the year 928, one pound could buy a person 15 cows.

40 You typically only breathe out of one nostril at a time.

You might think that your nostrils share the workload when it comes to taking in oxygen. And while they do, it's not quite in the way that you might expect. Instead of both taking in the same amount of air when you breathe, you actually inhale most of your oxygen through one nostril at a time. Every few hours, the active nostril will take a break and the other one will take over until they ultimately switch back again.

41 ""Vegetables"" don't really exist.

Professional chefs and home cooks may use the word ""vegetable"" to describe everything from asparagus and broccoli to zucchini and yams. But it turns out the term has no scientific value. When the BBC asked botanist Wolfgang Stuppy of the Royal Botanic Gardens if vegetables really exist, he answered, ""No, not botanically… the term vegetable doesn't exist in botanical terminology.""

42 Astronauts can now bake cookies in space.

Astronauts have to nosh on space-safe versions of the foods we eat on Earth. However, in fall 2019, the International Space Station tested out a space oven that will allow those aboard to bake cookies. Seriously, this dreamy device is specifically designed for the sugary treats!

According to Scientific American, ""When scientists investigated the potential psychological effects of long-term missions and deep-space travel, they found things would be more bearable if astronauts have access to a good variety of foods that smell and taste a little bit more like home."" What's more, former astronaut Mike Massimino explained that preparing food boosts morale by adding ""a sense of normalcy"" to astronauts' time away from Earth. Yep, even astronauts love the smell of fresh-baked cookies!

43 It takes nearly two days for a human to discharge a Lego through their body.

Anyone who's been around Legos knows that they're incredibly painful to step on. But have you ever wondered what happens when you swallow one? In a 2018 study published in the Journal of Pediatrics and Child Health, six volunteers decided to find out by ingesting a Lego figurine head (a piece that is much rounder and presumably easier on the digestive system than a rectangular one). The researchers determined that it takes an average of 1.71 days to pass a Lego through the human body.

44 There are Bonsai trees that produce oranges.

Bonsai trees are famous for their compact beauty, growing in shapely ways that artists and hobbyists take great care to nurture and tend. However, it's less well-known that there are Bonsai trees that actually produce oranges!

45 Lake Bled contains the only natural island in Slovenia.

If you want to enjoy island life in Slovenia, there's only one place you can go: Bled Island. The teardrop-shaped landmass is the only naturally occurring island in the entire European country. Not even a full acre in size, it's home to a picturesque 17th-century church and beautiful greenery, but not much else.

46 Shakespeare may have worn a gold hoop earring as a sign of his bohemian ways.

Shakespeare is most famous for his plays and poems, but he also had a signature sense of style. In a portrait attributed to the artist John Taylor (pictured here), Shakespeare can be seen with a full beard, casually loosened shirt-ties, and a gold hoop hanging from his left ear. And that gold hoop may have been more than just a spiffy fashion choice. He may have chosen the accessory to signal to others that he was a bohemian who lived a life filled with creativity instead of conformity. Viva la vie Bohème!

47 Neanderthals may have trapped golden eagles 130,000 years ago.

We tend to think of Neanderthals as simple cave-dwellers who made basic tools and hunted down mammals. But, according to Science magazine, our ancient predecessors were actually more skilled than we may have thought: There's evidence that they learned to trap golden eagles as many as 130,000 years ago.

0,"Australia’s wildfires have now burned more than 15.5 million acres across the continent, leaving at least 25 people dead.

In addition to the catastrophic impact on life and human health, the fires have also left an estimated 1.25 billion animals dead, according to the World Wildlife Fund, which arrived at this figure based on University of Sydney Professor Chris Dickman’s work.

“We’re all devastated. Devastated, but in the really fortunate position that we’ve got the kind of skilled staff that can go into the field and really make a difference,” said Michelle Lang, general manager at Zoos Victoria, which operates three zoos in the state, as well as a host of other conservation programs.

Organizations like Zoos Victoria have found themselves pressed into de facto emergency relief agencies on the front lines of saving impacted animals. Two Zoos Victoria veterinary staff members were recently given permission to go into fire zones in order to treat koalas and other wildlife.

“Despite their injuries and trauma, the bravery shown by the koalas and wildlife at Mallacoota is inspiring,” Dr. Leanne Wicker, who went into the bush, said in a press release.

According to Lang, Zoos Victoria was “pretty well prepared” to engage in their response role, considering the sheer scale of the fires, because of previous programs they have implemented, such as their Marine Response Unit, which was created 2013 responds to calls for assistance with vulnerable animals on a daily basis.

Lang pointed out that many of the most decimated wildlife populations will be, “small, unknown, unglamorous animals that are so vital to our ecosystem and our chain of biodiversity.

“Some species, there were only 2,000 of them before the fires, so we hate of think how many of them will be left after this,” she said.

In addition to the iconic koala bears, other impacted animals across the continent include the nabarlek, bilby, northern bettong, gouldian finch, numbat, and wiliji.

Dr. Stuart Blanch, Senior Manager of Land Clearing and Restoration at WWF-Australia, identified the long-footed potoroo, mountain pygmy possum, yellow-bellied glider and brush-tailed rock wallaby, as well as the regent honeyeater and glossy black cockatoo, which are both critically endangered, as being particularly at-risk, due to the destruction of their habitats.

Blanch told USA Today earlier this week that, “Up to 30% of koalas (as many as 8,400 koalas) may have perished during fires on the mid-north coast of New South Wales. This is a devastating blow for a species already in decline, due to ongoing excessive tree-clearing for agricultural and urban development, and pushes the species closer to becoming an endangered species.

“This has the potential to hasten koalas’ slide towards extinction in the wild in eastern Australia,” he said.

Contextualizing the impact of these fires, WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman said many of the country’s forests and animals are facing a decades-long recovery, if the latter are able to bounce back at all.

“… some species may have tipped over the brink of extinction,” O’Gorman said in a written statement.

Zoos Victoria, which launched a $30 million initiative to save 20 species from extinction in 2015, has since grown that number to 27. They also operate conservation programs in six countries and can point to several successes such as their breeding of the critically endangered Baw Baw frog last year, and releasing dozens of critically endangered orange-bellied parrots into the wild. On the strength of this experience, they are anticipating which steps will be required after the fires die down. Lang said that potential scenarios include supplementary feeding programs for animals that survive, but are faced with a lack of food, animals that need to be protected from an over-population of predators, new holding areas, specific food items, habitat restoration, and extra staff.

During this critical care phase, funds going to Zoo Victoria now will support vets during their week-long forays into the field in the upcoming months as well as ensuring that animals receive uninterrupted care at their facilities.

100% of donated funds donated to Zoos Victoria will go directly to bushfire-impacted wildlife.

“We’ve been really humbled by the support that we’ve received so far. Some people give $5, and that’s really fantastic. We’re asking people to think about wildlife that’s really suffering,” Lang said.

Though Zoos Victoria is currently responding to alleviate the suffering of animals, and planning for possible eventualities, the full scope of the damage at the moment, to say nothing of what the reality will be after the fires die down, is unknown.

“We don’t actually know what we’re dealing with,” Lang said.","Amid Australia’s Devastating Wildfires, Animal Rescue Groups Working Overtime",https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEE1KNiccEE1KMKbCBAucciYqGQgEKhAIACoHCAows9mICzD8zocDMKicnQY?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://i0.wp.com/www.directrelief.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LW-koala.jpg?w=1200&crop=0%2C0px%2C100%2C675px&ssl=1,2020-01-10,"{'sent': 'Australia’s wildfires have now burned more than 15.5 million acres across the continent, leaving at least 25 people dead.\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Australia'], 'QUANTITY': ['more than 15.5 million acres'], 'CARDINAL': ['at least 25']}}","Australia’s wildfires have now burned more than 15.5 million acres across the continent, leaving at least 25 people dead.

0,"The last known Carolina Parakeet died in an Ohio zoo in 1918. The species was declared extinct in 1939, more than a century after John James Audubon warned that the birds “are very rapidly diminishing in numbers; and in some districts, where twenty-five years ago they were plentiful, scarcely any are now to be seen.”

The colorful birds were believed to be the only native parrot found in the eastern U.S. Now they only exist as museum specimens. A recent study confirmed their extinction was caused by humans. Far less known is the thick-billed parrot, the other native parrot species once found in the United States. This species had a much more limited range: central Arizona and southern New Mexico. They disappeared from these states by the 1920s.

Global extinction is what everybody thinks about, but extirpation—or local extinction—has a significant effect on biodiversity.

The thick-billed parrot is not, however, extinct—not yet. The birds can still be heard in the western mountains of Mexico. The population, at just a few thousand birds, is endangered by deforestation, climate change, and an illegal pet trade.

The extirpation, or local extinction, of a species from a region isn’t as dramatic as a global extinction. Global extinction is what everybody thinks (and talks) about, but extirpation has a significant effect on biodiversity. But because extirpation isn’t global, it can be ameliorated by reintroduction. Peregrine falcons, for one, were eliminated from the eastern U.S. because of DDT by the 1970s. Hand-reared and hacked (released) birds were the genesis of a successful reintroduction program whose results can now be seen flying in the skies over major American cities.

It took a combined effort of federal, state, and private organizations to reintroduce thick-billed parrots to the mountains of southeastern Arizona, beginning in 1986. An article in The Condor by a team of participants documents what happened.

The authors considered two questions. Had the species actually bred in the U.S. historically? Or were sightings attributable to the wide-ranging flocking of Mexican-resident birds? The consensus among ornithologists had been that the species didn’t nest in the U.S., but these authors argue that the “available historical information does not rule out the possibility” of a resident breeding population in southern Arizona.

But what was the cause of the bird’s disappearance in the U.S.? The team points to “wide-spread shooting” as the main culprit. “The Thick-billed Parrot is highly gregarious and noisy, and relatively large and tame, characteristics making it especially vulnerable to hunting,” they write. Prospectors in the Arizona mountains around the turn of the twentieth century also eliminated elk, pronghorn sheep, bighorn sheep, and wild turkey with their subsistence-hunting.

For the reintroduction effort, 88 parrots were released in Arizona’s Chiricahua Mountains between 1986 and 1993. Most of these were birds confiscated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from the illegal pet trade. The results of the reintroduction were mixed. Wild-caught Mexican birds relocated to Arizona had the best survival rates. Captive-raised birds the worst, “due mainly to deficits in foraging and socialization.” The researchers documented a few breeding attempts, suggesting their hypothesis about original breeding in the U.S. had some basis.

However, starvation and predation took a heavy toll on the released birds. Food was an issue because of the 1989-1990 draught and “the total failure of the ponderosa and Arizona pine cone crops in the region.” Predators included Northern goshawks, red-tailed hawks, and ring-tailed cats, all threats present in the Mexican mountains.

The thick-billed parrot is a very social bird, a “species that one might expect to be especially dependent on ‘critical mass’ efforts in keeping mortality rates at acceptable levels.” The authors write “the number of birds released in our experiments fell far below the numbers that would be optimal for reestablishing efforts.”

In our efforts to repair the damage we do, some efforts come up short. The reintroduction program was abandoned in 1993, and the last of the reintroduced birds was seen in 1995. While escaped or released tropical parrots can be found around the U.S., we’re back to where we were a century ago: without an indigenous parrot species to brighten the skies.

As a country, Nigeria is blessed with beautiful landscapes, ranging from tropical rainforests and mangroves in the South (which is believe to be among the largest in the world), to mountain ranges in the Mambilla plateau, as well as savanna and desert in the far North-East. The country falls within the Guinean forest of West Africa, a global biodiversity hot-spot that provides a unique habitat for many endangered West African wildlife species. The country harbours important bird species, just as mammals, butterflies, reptiles and 91 endemic plants (species found nowhere else) have been documented.

Our protected areas (PAs), which include parks, reserves and sanctuaries, shelter most of our wildlife species. According to a report by the World Commission on PAs, Nigeria’s PA network covers 14.01per cent of the total mass. While for many years, these PAs play a vital role in the protection and conservation of our wildlife species as well as provisioning of supporting and ecosystem services, they are under serious pressures than ever in recent times. Most prominent among these is human population growth, which is putting too much pressure on the wildlife resources. The increased demand for bush meat has led to severe decline of our wildlife species, particularly in the southern part of the country. Another menace is the use of wildlife species parts in traditional medicines, where they are sourced from PAs and sold at exorbitant prices. While doing these to satisfy our greed and needs, we forget the fact that the next generation will pay for the price of these losses.

On the other hand, for the fact that 70per cent of Nigerians depend on fuel wood, its increased demand has caused various disturbances in most of these PAs and their sorroundings. In addition, increased demand for timber by the Asian countries has caused massive deforestation and degradations in our natural environment, haven for our wildlife species.

In the Niger Delta region, pollution and habitat degradation and loss due to oil explorations has caused massive loss of natural habitats, critical nursery site for wildlife species. In the Hadejia-Nguru Wetlands, for instance, a notorious grass has already degraded and taken a significant part of the wetland, an important site not only for resident bird species but for migratory species as well.

Federal and state governments that are the custodians of our PAs, and, of course wildlife species, neglected the management of these areas. Some of these PAs are not even connected to national power grid, and so, can go for weeks without light.

In the Dagona Waterfowl Sanctuary, a section of the Chad Basin National Park has no power supply for nearly a decade, even with the excellent chalet laid down. The Obudu Cattle Ranch, one of the country’s ultimate tourist attraction, has no light for years, and the infrastructures are left to decay.

The Kainji Lake National Park is a place where one hardly gets in contact with the outside world because of very poor mobile network. Our great conservation warriors (park rangers) are also experiencing distinguished challenges. Among the key challenges are the general lack of sound working equipment, particularly patrol vehicles, which often have to be pushed in order to start, and the patrol only lasted for few days of the week due to insufficient fuel; lack of safety tools, especially modern weapons to defend their dear lives against poachers and the deficiency in the application of current knowledge on Protected Area Management, among others. This is worsened with very poor support from both federal and state governments to sponsor the protected area managers abroad, or regularly organise local workshops, seminars and trainings to tap from the use and applications of modern techniques and innovations in protected area management from experts.

Our PAs lack sufficient work- force to protect wildlife, and graduates of wildlife courses are roaming the streets, with fresh ideas untapped. In some PAs, especially within state governments, when old staff die they are hardly replaced.

In some PAs, wildlife graduates and those who have diplomas and certificates, as well as those that do not but are keen about wildlife conservation, are volunteering to protect our wildlife with no or very little incentives and motivations. In most cases, the protected area managers sponsor themselves in order to keep in check with the current challenges as well as advancement in wildlife management and conservation. Gone are the days when we will sit back and watch our wildlife species disappear.

Recently, insecurity in and around PAs emerged as the greatest threat to our wildlife conservation. For instance, the Kamuku National Park is one of no-go-areas because it has become a hideout for bandits, cattle rustlers and kidnappers. The Sambisa Game Reserve has long been taken over by Boko Haram. The Kainji Lake National Park and Chad Basin National Park, as well as Falgore Game Reserve, are also danger zones for protected area managers, researchers and visitors. The areas around the Lake Chad basin are some of the most critical habitats for aquatic and other terrestrial wildlife species, yet, it is a no-go-area.

Recently, the Nigerian Army and Nigeria Park Service teamed up in protecting our parks and reserves. However, the question we should ask ourselves here is: What is the fate of our wildlife species, PAs and national heritage? A number of wildlife species have become history in Nigeria. And many are presently declining rapidly, and once lost, can hardly be recovered.

Black rhinoceros once roamed Adamawa, Borno, and Bauchi. The West African giraffe and cheetah can no longer be found anywhere in Nigeria. Vultures, important natural environmental cleaners are on the verge of becoming extinct.

The bird and black-crowned crane (the officially recognised national bird) that were common around the North have all vanished. Lions, crocodiles, jackals, gazelles and hyenas that were common have all been extirpated in most PAs. Lions have very low viable population in the Kainji National Park and Yankari Game Reserve.

In the Falgore Game Reserve, the Buffalo and other large mammals have disappeared completely.

The Cross River gorilla, which are found only in Nigeria and Cameroon, are at risk of disappearing forever because scientists estimated that there might be 200 to 300 of them. This ape is considered as the most endangered primate in the world. The pangolins are being heavily poached and traded for their scales, pushing them into extinction. Globally, Nigeria is believed to be a country mostly involved in pangolins trade.

The Nigerian chimpanzee (with number less than 9,000) is facing the same scenario due to extreme loss of habitat as a result of deforestation across all its ranges.

The elephants, because of their migratory nature, and for the fact that we are encroaching on their natural habitats, we are increasing conflicts with them, and whenever man and wildlife collide, wildlife suffers. The list of the wildlife crises goes on. However, thanks to government and some non-governmental conservation organisations like the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and National Park Service that are making tireless efforts to conserve these iconic but magnificent species.

Federal and state governments should, therefore, invest heavily and provide a holistic approach to wildlife conservation. We must do whatever it takes to protect this national heritage, our pride, our future. What a shame if in our generation these heritages vanish.

Our wildlife and PAs, if well conserved and managed, can provide an avenue for research studies and tourism.

PAs provide clean air and water, healthy soil, wild food and medicines. They help mitigate against extreme weather events (climate change, flood), maintain functioning ecosystem and provide shelter for plants and animals to adapt to an ever-changing world.

Mamoni Malakar was the first to see it. Besides herself with excitement, the 31-year-old resident of Dadara village in Assam’s Kamrup district dialled her mentor Purnima Devi Barman. In September 2017, along with Barman — a wildlife biologist— Malakar had begun an experiment. It was a makeshift nest, put together with bamboo and branches of the kodom tree, to assist the birth of a tiny baby bird.

It was the Greater Adjutant Stork (GAS), or Hargila, as it is known in Assamese — “endangered” as per International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and “ignored” by people. The ungainly Hargila — with its bald head and massive pouch on its neck, living off garbage dumps — was always considered a bad omen.

But all changed when Barman — associated with wildlife NGO Aaranyak — took it upon herself to save the bird. The result is a group of village women committed to the cause of protecting and conserving the endangered ""ugly"" bird, and an affectionate epithet for Barman: “Hargila baideo” or ‘Stork sister’.

In 2017, Barman begun an experiment to artificially breed the Hargila — another step in her relentless campaign for the stork. The group’s first attempt failed. But in November 2018, a young chick was born. Nearly five months later, there was good news — and Malakar was the first to see it.

The baby bird had taken flight.

A SUCCESS STORY TURNS TRAGIC

Nearly a year later, following Barman's method, a pair of Greater Adjutant Storks was born in the Guwahati zoo — arguably the first instance of the bird being artificially bred in a zoo, as confirmed by the Assam State Zoo Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Tejas Mariswamy.

Acknowledging the success, Cathy King, chair of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) and long legged water bird specialist, said in a statement, “Although Greater Adjutant Storks have been kept in zoos throughout the world, they have not successfully bred until now. The captive breeding of this species at Guwahati Zoo is a great contribution to the conservation of this endangered species. This breeding could only occur if the birds have a suitable environment and good care.”

Captive breeding of other stork species have successfully taken place in the past. The population of milky stork, found mainly in Southeast Asia, was revived through captive breeding in Zoo Negara in Malaysia.

The Greater Adjutant Stork project is a collaboration between NGO Aaranyak and the Assam State Zoo. “The fact that we were successful in the zoo shows that captive breeding of these birds is possible, which augurs very well for their population in future,” says Barman.

However, the euphoria was short-lived. On January 17, both chicks were killed by their father. Barman says that such acts are not uncommon among storks. “This is heartbreaking for all of us. But ultimately we have to accept it as this is a natural process. We have been consulting experts like Cathy King, who told us that breeding success of the Hargila is less. More than 45% chicks die in infancy which is a major reason behind their slow population growth,” she says.

DFO Mariswamy says that despite the setback, this initiative will continue in the Assam State Zoo. “ We consider this year's effort as a success because the chicks were born. In the first month, the chicks need to stay in their mother’s care. If they survive upto three months, we can try to hand-raise them. This is a difficult call to take actually. We don’t know what the implications will be if we remove the chicks from the nest,” he says.

'WILL SUCCEED EVENTUALLY'

Over the years, the population of the Greater Adjutant Stork dwindled because of poisoning and habitat loss. Once found abundantly in India, now they are present only in some pockets of Assam and Bihar. Globally, the species has about 1200 individuals, out of which around 800 are found in Assam itself.

Three villages in the state's Kamrup district, Dadara, Pachariya and Singimari, contribute almost one-third of the world’s total population of Greater Adjutant Stork in the wild. There are approximately 200 nests of Hargilas in these villages.

Nicelle Beauchene is pleased to announce Patterns & Rituals, an exhibition of new paintings by Tunji Adeniyi-Jones. For his second solo exhibition at the main gallery, Adeniyi-Jones presents an installation of large-scale oil on canvas paintings that form an epic frieze across the gallery’s walls. Continuing the artist’s investigations into West African religious practices and Yoruba traditions, the works on view assess methods of worship, idolatry, and myth.

Ritualized repetition is key to the maintenance of ceremony and is central to the artist’s process. Within fields of deep blues, purples, pinks, and greens, Adeniyi-Jones frequently reworks figures, patterns, and forms over and over again. Each painting in Patterns & Rituals features highly stylized figures or animals set amidst lush foliage and bright color. He creates a space to emphasize motion flowing in and around the figures using leaves and vines that fill the background, emulating the curves and shapes of their bodies.

Several of the paintings feature the Black Crowned Crane—Nigeria’s national bird—while others depict ritual masks used in Yoruba masquerades and ceremonies. For the first time, two paintings include stylized lions, a nod to the 1959 play The Lion and the Jewel by Wole Soyinka, which explores the tensions between a modernizing country and it’s traditional ways of life.

As the narrative in the large frieze unfolds, Adeniyi-Jones uses imagery of a jungle as a way to represent and explore infinite possibility. Referencing the surreal visual environments of Henri Rousseau and the conflicts of modernity and post-Colonialism found Chinua Achebe’s writings, Adeniyi-Jones considers both ancient and contemporary in his latest body of work. Using a lens of classical themes, the artist creates a visual storyline to contemplate the present.

Tunji Adeniyi-Jones (b. 1992, London, England) lives and works in New York. He received his BFA in Fine Art from Oxford University and his MFA in Painting and Printmaking from the Yale School of Art. Recent solo exhibitions include The Cabin, Los Angeles, CA; Hunter Harrision, London, UK; and Nicelle Beauchene Gallery, New York, NY. He is currently included in the traveling exhibition Young, Gifted, and Black: The Lumpkin-Bocuzzi Family Collection; Other group exhibitions include Eric Firestone, East Hampton, NY; Johannes Vogt Gallery, East Hampton, NY; and Loyal Gallery, Stockholm, Sweden.

By NewsDesk @infectiousdiseasenews

The Swedish Public Health Authority reported this week that dozens of psittacosis, or parrot fever cases have been reported in recent months.

Since September 2019, some 40 cases of parrot disease have been reported, mainly from the regions of Västra Götaland, Stockholm and Jämtland. Three-quarters of the cases are men and are mainly people over 50 years of age.

Most of those who have become ill have come into contact with bird migration from wild birds, for example through the handling of bird tables and other outdoor activities.

During the early 2000s, only a handful of cases were reported during the winter season, but since the winter of 2012-2013, the number of reported cases has increased. This can be partly explained by changes in the diagnosis of the disease. In order for patients with pneumonia to be quickly diagnosed and given the right treatment, it is still important that health care professionals are aware of the presence of parrot disease.

Psittacosis is a disease caused by bacteria called Chlamydophila psittaci. It is usually transmitted by inhaling the agent from dried droppings or secretions of infected birds.

Patients with psittacosis usually present fever, headache, rash, muscle pain, chills and dry cough. Pneumonia may sometimes occur, and occasional complications include encephalitis, myocarditis and thrombophlebitis.

The disease can be treated effectively with antibiotics.

0,"I have been able to see distant corners of the world in my lifetime—and I gained a greater understanding of the urgent fight to save our planet because of it, as well as the human connections that keep us connected beyond borders and languages.

Everywhere I go in the world, I look for new things to learn about the animals, transportation, history and the way people live.

Seeing Polar Bears with Churchill Wild

I hoped that someday I would see a Polar Bear in its natural habitat—but also assumed that I would be in a vehicle a safe distance away when I saw them. When I chose to go on an adventure with Churchill Wild at Nanuk Polar Bear Lodge, though, that wasn’t the case. Instead, I put on my borrowed boots and Churchill Wild coat and walked with our guides near wolves and polar bears. It was truly spectacular to be close to these giant creatures, and it reminded me, leading up to a pivotal election, how important it was for us to show up at the polls for the animals who can’t.

Saving the Fijian Crested Iguana in Fiji

The Republic of Fiji in the South Pacific Ocean consists of over 330 islands, about a third of which are inhabited. These islands have been populated for 5,000 years, originally settled by adventurers who are thought to have made their way over 1,000 miles by canoe from New Zealand. Like many island nations, Fiji is home to numerous unique plants and animals, many of which also floated by sea from other far-off lands and have adapted to Fiji’s unique environment over many millions of years.

5,000 years of human habitation are exacting a toll of Fiji’s rich biodiversity. Some researchers have estimated that 25 percent of bird species, 12 percent of mammals, 67 percent of amphibians and 11 percent of reptiles and plants are already threatened or endangered.

In my first several visits to the Fijian Islands, I said, “Bula,” which means hello and welcome, to everyone. I loved the clear waters, incredible scuba diving and white sandy beaches. On my recent stay at Likuliku Lagoon Resort, I also loved lending a helping hand in the fight to save the Fijian Crested Iguana. This creature was thought to be extinct—but after two were found nearly 10 years ago, the resort has made heroic efforts, along with USGS and the San Diego Zoo, to restore the tropical dry forest, remove the invasive species and create a captive breeding program.

I got a first hand look at a turn-back-the-clock success story at the Likuliku Lagoon Resort (owned by Ahura Resorts) on Fiji’s volcanic Malolo Island, which has brought the Fijian crested iguana back from the brink of extinction. Ahura resorts have claimed to be wholly committed to sustainable tourism and have backed that commitment up with, among other things, herculean efforts to save this iconic, critically endangered iguana. Their efforts have included restoring the tropical dry forest with over 4500 seedlings of nearly two dozen species planted in the last four years, controlling mammalian invasive species, implementing a Fijian Crested Iguana captive breeding program and collaborating with scientists from USGS and San Diego Zoo.

From 1984 to 2010, there were no sightings of the Fijian crested iguana. Today, there are many sightings of the species out in the last remnant of protected forest within the resort leases.

There is an educational and awareness program implemented for guests, staff, the local community and also at the sister property, Malolo Island Resort. While on property, guests can assist with tree planting and scouting at night for these amazing species. Part of the nightly room fee goes to help with their environment initiatives and conservation programs, and you can make a donation at any time.

Scuba Diving with Bull Sharks in Mexico

I am a science teacher by training, and I love school, but I never thought I would go to Dr. Erich Ritter’s SharkSchool™ with ProDive International at Playa del Carmen. We learned about shark behavior in the program and went scuba diving with bull sharks.

Did you know that in New York City, in 2018, approximately 12 people died from human bites? That’s double the number of fatal shark bites for that year—and never mind how they got them! The movies make it seem like sharks are out to get us, but humans are the ones attacking sharks with over 100 million and possibly closer to 275 million sharks killed last year. Sharks are ocean stewards, eating weak fish and keeping schools of fish in check. We must use common sense and be respectful of the ocean ecosystem as we are greatly disturbing the balance.

Turning Warriors into Friends in the Maasai Mara

I travel with my hula hoop; it has five sections and it fits in my suitcase. I have hula-hooped on two trains in Canada, with villagers in Vanuatu and with the warriors of the Maasai Mara in Kenya. I always ask permission before hooping in a village because it is unusual, and might not be received well, but after I showed Chief Richard of Olonana, Kenya a video of me hula-hooping—because he had no idea what I was talking about—he started to smile. Hula-hoops make people laugh! When you wander around the world, it is good to make new friends.

Eat a Lionfish, Save the Planet

I first saw a Lionfish when I was scuba diving in the Red Sea. They have 14 long feather-like pectoral fins that look like a mane and 13 poisonous dorsal spines. They seemed both beautiful and dangerous to me. Unfortunately, the Lionfish have invaded the Caribbean, and are decimating the reefs and other fish. They have no predators except humans—and while many island countries are taking action against them and scuba divers are having derbies to kill them, they are very hardy fish. They lay many eggs and those babies survive far too well in the warm waters.

You can help: eat Lionfish! (They are tasty and safe to eat.)

Learning to Sing in Swahili

Wherever I roam, I learn words in the local language. I do not always quite get it right, of course. Once, in Nepal, I accidentally asked for dog meat in my momo—a local dish like a roll with meat inside—instead of chicken. There were several minutes of serious confusion, but when we figured it out, we all had a good laugh.

When I was on safari in Tanzania with Abercrombie and Kent at Sanctuary Kichakani, I learned many words—and the team even sang me a song! It felt magical to be among them while they were singing and smiling.

Witnessing—and Helping Preserve—Biodiversity in the Galapagos

Often, when I travel, I think I am going to learn or see one thing—but when I arrive, I discover much more than I expected. When I was a young girl going to summer camp, my mom packed a book about Charles Darwin’s journey in the Galapagos Islands in my suitcase. Ever since then, and for many decades, I have dreamed about the birds, tortoises and endemic creatures of the islands and wanted to see them myself.

I finally made that dream come true when I traveled on Ecoventura’s Theory in December of last year. Not only did I see the blue-footed boobies, but I also learned that there are red-footed boobies, and Nazca boobies with orange beaks.

Blue Footed Booby on North Seymour Island, Galapagos by Lisa Niver

The Galapagos Islands are a group of 22 islands—called an archipelago– right on the Equator in the eastern Pacific. The islands were made famous by Charles Darwin 150 years ago who was fascinated by the dozens of endemic species of birds, iguanas, tortoises and plants, species that are found nowhere else on the planet. In 1978, this wonderland of biodiversity became the very first site declared as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.)

Unfortunately, by then, human settlers had arrived—bringing with them not only domesticated animals like goats and chickens and burros, which competed for the island’s scarce food resources, but also rats and cats that wreaked havoc on the birds and iguanas.

Floreana is the sixth largest island in the Galapagos islands archipelago with a colorful history of human settlement that includes pirates, murder and mayhem. But the endemic species have come under ever-increasing threat from the invasive species humans brought with them. 55 species found on the Floreana are currently listed on the International Union for Conservation Red List, meaning these species are in danger of extinction if action is not taken to save them. Thirteen species are already locally extinct on the Island, but can be reintroduced after invasive predators are removed.

Faced with the stark reality that the Galapagos treasure trove of unique plants and animals are literally disappearing, the Galapagos National Park, the Biosecurity Agency of Galapagos, Island Conservation and Floreana residents and leadership are implementing an innovative project to remove invasive species from the island so they can then reintroduce the locally extinct species. This project is the most complex eradication project conducted on any inhabited tropical island. When I was in the Galapagos on Ecoventura’s Theory in December 2019, I was guided by Peter Freire whose family has been on Floreana for generations. His family and the island community are fully committed to preserving and restoring their local wildlife.

Finding out Why in Odgen, Utah

Although I have been to Park City, Utah for skiing more than 30 times, I went skiing in Odgen, Utah for the first time recently. I loved the three ski mountains, learning to throw an axe and the Spencer and Dolores Dore Eccles Rail Center and Utah State Railroad Museum at Ogden Union Station. At the train museum, I learned how the railroad was built from east to west and west to east and met in Ogden, Utah for the final spike.

The train traveled in both directions on one track, and the engineers in all parts of our country needed to know exactly what time the train was arriving so that there were no train collisions. In the 1800s, the railroads began using a time system with four time zones, Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific so that there would be no confusion about what time it was. Prior to that, many areas set their own time by the sun and high noon. It was incredible to imagine so many people using far less efficient technology to work together successfully.

Uncovering a Secret History in Canada

I love to travel by plane, boat or train. In Canada, I traveled on the Rocky Mountaineer train from Vancouver to Banff with a night in Kamloops. We saw osprey, eagles and bears and learned to talk like an engineer. The bridges, mountains and spiral tunnels kept us nearly as entertained as the history we learned. There was a time when Vancouver and all of British Colombia were considering joining the United States of America. However, the Canadian government promised to create the railway and unite the Canadian economy—so Vancouver did not join the U.S.!

Trying a Sport from the Middle Ages

When I was in Kilkenny, Ireland, I tried out hurling—an ancient Gaelic Irish outdoor team game which has been played for 4,000 years. I also went on an hour long Hawk Walk at Ireland’s School of Falconry at Ashford Castle. Falconry was popular in the Middle Ages in Europe. We went out into the forest with a Harris Hawk and I was able to send it out for a flight when it was perched on my leather glove and it came back to me for a treat of fresh meat. The hawks are powerful predators with sharp talons. I loved learning about them and watching them fly.",10 Global Travel Adventures To Inspire Global Eco-Activism,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vbXNtYWdhemluZS5jb20vMjAyMC8wMi8yNC9pbnNwaXJlZC1ieS10cmF2ZWxpbmcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/boys-in-hoop-Village-Lowinnia-Vanuatu-1024x876-1.jpg,2020-02-24,"{'sent': 'Seeing Polar Bears with Churchill Wild\n\n', 'ents': {'PERSON': ['Churchill Wild']}}","I have been able to see distant corners of the world in my lifetime—and I gained a greater understanding of the urgent fight to save our planet because of it, as well as the human connections that keep us connected beyond borders and languages.

Everywhere I go in the world, I look for new things to learn about the animals, transportation, history and the way people live.

Seeing Polar Bears with Churchill Wild

I hoped that someday I would see a Polar Bear in its natural habitat—but also assumed that I would be in a vehicle a safe distance away when I saw them. When I chose to go on an adventure with Churchill Wild at Nanuk Polar Bear Lodge, though, that wasn’t the case. Instead, I put on my borrowed boots and Churchill Wild coat and walked with our guides near wolves and polar bears. It was truly spectacular to be close to these giant creatures, and it reminded me, leading up to a pivotal election, how important it was for us to show up at the polls for the animals who can’t.

Saving the Fijian Crested Iguana in Fiji

The Republic of Fiji in the South Pacific Ocean consists of over 330 islands, about a third of which are inhabited. These islands have been populated for 5,000 years, originally settled by adventurers who are thought to have made their way over 1,000 miles by canoe from New Zealand. Like many island nations, Fiji is home to numerous unique plants and animals, many of which also floated by sea from other far-off lands and have adapted to Fiji’s unique environment over many millions of years.

5,000 years of human habitation are exacting a toll of Fiji’s rich biodiversity. Some researchers have estimated that 25 percent of bird species, 12 percent of mammals, 67 percent of amphibians and 11 percent of reptiles and plants are already threatened or endangered.

In my first several visits to the Fijian Islands, I said, “Bula,” which means hello and welcome, to everyone. I loved the clear waters, incredible scuba diving and white sandy beaches. On my recent stay at Likuliku Lagoon Resort, I also loved lending a helping hand in the fight to save the Fijian Crested Iguana.

0,"The federal government is to investigate a video that has gone viral showing a Manatee, otherwise known as sea cow, being dragged on the streets in Delta State.

Minister of State for Environment, Mrs. Sharon Ikeazor, in a tweet yesterday in which she said the government would probe the animal abuse, described the incident as a show of shame.

The Delta State Government also condemned the maltreatment of the animal and threatened to prosecute those found culpable.

The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) administration has also vowed to clamp down on the illegal sales of endangered wildlife products in a move perceived as a precautionary measure against the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus disease.

According to Wikipedia, Manatees are ""large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals that measure up to 4.0 metres, weigh as much as 590 kilograms and have paddle-like flippers.""

Manatees are occasionally called sea cows, as they are slow plant-eaters, peaceful and similar to cows on land. They often graze on water plants in tropical seas.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), classified Manatees as ""Vulnerable"" in its Red-list for threatened species and stressed the dire need to preserve, rehabilitate and care for them.

In a treading video, described by many as ""distressing"", ""distasteful"", ""disgusting"" and ""horrific,"" a captured manatee was being dragged on bare ground by some youths yesterday.

Reacting to the maltreatment of the animal, Ikeazor said: ""My attention has been drawn to a very distressing and distasteful video of a captured manatee in the Niger Delta region being dragged on bare ground to a cruel fate by some ill-informed/uninformed youth. I strongly condemn this act.

""It is sad that manatees remain one of the most heavily hunted aquatic mammals; the repeated occurrence must be of great concern to us all

""The Ministry of Environment will increase efforts in wildlife conservation and working with relevant national, state agencies and conservationists, especially in coastal regions to protect and conserve endangered marine species and their habitat"", the minister stated in her twitter handle, @sharon ikeazor.

She added that an awareness campaign must be carried out in the Niger Delta and coastal regions to educate the people to protect the Manatee due to its importance in the nation's biodiversity and its ecological importance.

""But at the same time, an alternative livelihood must be developed as an incentive to the coastal people to protect and not hunt manatees; we must gather widespread support and develop a specific conservation strategy for manatees in Nigeria.

Delta Condemns Maltreatment of Sea Cow, Threatens to Prosecute Culprits

Also, the Delta State Government has condemned what it described as inhuman act by some youths against the captured Manatee and threatened to prosecute those found culpable.

It said the actions of the youths were an embarrassment to the state against the animal, which it said is among protective sea animals.

In a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, the state government frowned on the actions of the youths which negates the Bonn Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.

The state government warned that anyone caught hunting protective animals within the state, would be arrested and prosecuted in line with relevant laws of the land.

""Let me re-emphasise that it is against the law for those in the habit of killing animals that are protected by the law.

""Anybody caught killing such animal will be jailed because we cannot continue to watch people destroy our nature out of ignorance

""Rather than kill such animals, people are advised to render help to them to return to their natural habitats where necessary,"" it added.

The state government said the Ministry of Information would partner its Environment counterpart and other government agencies to carry out intensive campaigns on the preservation of these endangered protective animals.

Meanwhile, the FCT administration said it would clamp down on the illegal sales of endangered wildlife products in a move perceived as a precautionary measure against the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease.

The threat followed reports indicating an upsurge in the sale of products derived from wildlife within the capital city.

The Acting Secretary of the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat, Mr. Ibe Chukwuemeka Prospect, issued the warning at a meeting between him and the stakeholders on wildlife management.

Minister of State for Environment, Mrs. Sharon Ikeazor, in a tweet yesterday in which she said the government would probe the animal abuse, described the incident as a show of shame.

The Delta State Government also condemned the maltreatment of the animal and threatened to prosecute those found culpable.

The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) administration has also vowed to clamp down on the illegal sales of endangered wildlife products in a move perceived as a precautionary measure against the outbreak of Novel Coronavirus disease.

According to Wikipedia, Manatees are ""large, fully aquatic, mostly herbivorous marine mammals that measure up to 4.0 metres, weigh as much as 590 kilograms and have paddle-like flippers.""

Manatees are occasionally called sea cows, as they are slow plant-eaters, peaceful and similar to cows on land. They often graze on water plants in tropical seas.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), classified Manatees as ""Vulnerable"" in its Red-list for threatened species and stressed the dire need to preserve, rehabilitate and care for them.

In a treading video, described by many as ""distressing"", ""distasteful"", ""disgusting"" and ""horrific,"" a captured manatee was being dragged on bare ground by some youths yesterday.

Reacting to the maltreatment of the animal, Ikeazor said: ""My attention has been drawn to a very distressing and distasteful video of a captured manatee in the Niger Delta region being dragged on bare ground to a cruel fate by some ill-informed/uninformed youth. I strongly condemn this act.

""It is sad that manatees remain one of the most heavily hunted aquatic mammals; the repeated occurrence must be of great concern to us all

""The Ministry of Environment will increase efforts in wildlife conservation and working with relevant national, state agencies and conservationists, especially in coastal regions to protect and conserve endangered marine species and their habitat"", the minister stated in her twitter handle, @sharon ikeazor.

She added that an awareness campaign must be carried out in the Niger Delta and coastal regions to educate the people to protect the Manatee due to its importance in the nation's biodiversity and its ecological importance.

""But at the same time, an alternative livelihood must be developed as an incentive to the coastal people to protect and not hunt manatees; we must gather widespread support and develop a specific conservation strategy for manatees in Nigeria.

Delta Condemns Maltreatment of Sea Cow, Threatens to Prosecute Culprits

Also, the Delta State Government has condemned what it described as inhuman act by some youths against the captured Manatee and threatened to prosecute those found culpable.

It said the actions of the youths were an embarrassment to the state against the animal, which it said is among protective sea animals.

In a statement by the Commissioner for Information, Mr. Charles Aniagwu, the state government frowned on the actions of the youths which negates the Bonn Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.

The state government warned that anyone caught hunting protective animals within the state, would be arrested and prosecuted in line with relevant laws of the land.

""Let me re-emphasise that it is against the law for those in the habit of killing animals that are protected by the law.

""Anybody caught killing such animal will be jailed because we cannot continue to watch people destroy our nature out of ignorance

""Rather than kill such animals, people are advised to render help to them to return to their natural habitats where necessary,"" it added.

The state government said the Ministry of Information would partner its Environment counterpart and other government agencies to carry out intensive campaigns on the preservation of these endangered protective animals.

Meanwhile, the FCT administration said it would clamp down on the illegal sales of endangered wildlife products in a move perceived as a precautionary measure against the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease.

The threat followed reports indicating an upsurge in the sale of products derived from wildlife within the capital city.

The Acting Secretary of the Agriculture and Rural Development Secretariat, Mr. Ibe Chukwuemeka Prospect, issued the warning at a meeting between him and the stakeholders on wildlife management.

According to him, Nigeria is a signatory to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) that seeks to protect fauna, flora and wild animals .

He expressed worries at the scale at which these derivatives of wildlife were sold on the streets of Abuja, while also restating the readiness of the administration to end the practice.

0,"The Nigerian environment ministry said it will launch an investigation after a video surfaced of a group of men dragging a tied-up manatee along a dirt road.

In the footage the animal looks to be in great dicomfort, flapping around as it is dragged by a rope around its tail for several metres.

The incident took place on 21 February in the oil-rich Delta region of the country, according to Blue Planet Society, an environmental campaign group who received the video.

In response to the video, Sharon Ikeazor, Nigeria’s Minister of State for Environment, strongly condemned the act on Twitter on Sunday.

She called it a “very distressing and distasteful” video, saying the animal being dragged to “a cruel fate by some ill informed youth”.

There are only 10,000 African manatees, which are largely herbivorous, left in the wild, according to data compiled in 2015 by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

0,"People across Nigeria have expressed shock and outrage at a video showing five young men dragging a manatee down the street. The upsetting footage shows the aquatic mammal struggling desperately and flapping its fins as the young men pull it down the dusty street by a rope tied around its tail.



Nigerian daily newspaper “The Guardian” reported that the video was filmed in Burutu, a town in Delta state in southern Nigeria. The video was first posted on social media on February 21. The video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Twitter alone.



The NGO Blue Planet Society, which describes itself as a volunteer pressure group campaigning to end the overexploitation of the world’s ocean, took to Twitter to denounce the video. “Horrific video of threatened West African manatee dragged down a street in Delta State, Nigeria yesterday,” Blue Planet Society tweeted. “We have informed @sharon_ikeazor, Nigerian Minister of State for Environment, who has said she will issue a statement and take action.”





Manatees are large aquatic mammals that you can find in shallow coastal waters and tropical parts of the Atlantic Ocean. They are mainly herbivorous. They are found in the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the Amazon basin, but also off the coast of West Africa. There are thought to be about 10,000 manatees in West Africa, but their population is declining rapidly, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.



Manatees have been listed as a protected species since 1975 by the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). They were moved to CITES' Appendix I in 2013, a classification that they face extinction. Even though there is a ban on hunting manatees in Nigeria, many people continue to hunt and kill them, especially as manatee meat, oil and organs are all prized ingredients in traditional medicine.



In a tweet, Sharon Ikeazor, the Nigerian Minister of State for Environment, “strongly condemned this act” and demanded that an investigation be launched into the matter.





“My attention has been drawn to a very distressing & distasteful video of a captured manatee in the Niger Delta Region being dragged on bare ground to a cruel fate by some ill informed/uninformed youth,” Ikeazor tweeted. “I strongly condemn this act.”



In another tweet, she promised that her ministry would intensify its efforts to protect animals, especially those in coastal regions.

The conservation community is gravely outraged by a recent gory video of an African Manatee being dragged through the street of a coastal community in Bayelsa State. The Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF) is also concerned by this ugly development, particularly because the African Manatee is an endangered species, with a population put at 10,000. We hope the authorities will move beyond rhetoric to ensure such never happens again.

There are three species of Manatee in the Nigerian waters, and in some West African countries: The Amazonian, the West Indian and the West African. Researchers say they live between 40 and 60 years in the wild. The mammal is protected by international law to save it from extinction. On Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), for instance, the African manatee is listed as endangered. While laws exist to protect the African manatee in every country in which it lives, these laws are not well enforced, especially in Nigeria. Due to this lack of enforcement and minimal education, the African manatee population is being steadily depleted.

Several new studies of Manatees in Nigeria have begun in the last five years, including at the University of Uyo, Cross River State. Named African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) for the reason that it is found in this region only, the species is mostly herbivorous. But it is believed to be endangered in Nigeria due to hunting and incidental capture during fishing operations, including the use of explosives in rivers. Another substantial threat is habitat destruction due to oil pollution. Conservationists believe the manatee is a vulnerable species because of its meat, oil, bones, and skin, which can bring great wealth to poachers. It is also hunted for organs used in traditional medicine, particularly the male reproductive organ which scientists say is used as aphrodisiac. In Nigeria and Cameroon, they are sold to zoos, aquariums, online as pets, and are sometimes shipped internationally. These poachers are gradually depleting the very small population of African Manatees to the utter distress of conservationists, despite the campaigns across local populations.

The unprovoked attack of that African Manatee in Bayelsa State is a clear indication that more education needs to be done in addition to strict enforcement of protection laws. However, it is also encouraging that the federal government has promised to take up and treat the case of this particular distressed manatee and other conservation issues with the firmness they deserve. More importantly, the government must take the lead in educating people in coastal communities, as well as those on the banks of rivers and lakes on the imperative of protecting the African Manatee and other endangered wildlife.

In doing so, the government should empower local community fishing groups on safe methods and educate school children through well-planned mentorship and training programmes on the conservation of the Manatee and protection of the marine ecosystem. They should be educated on the vital role Manatees play in helping to control the vegetation that can obstruct waterways. They also provide a benefit by processing the vegetation they eat and passing it back into the environment as a form of fertiliser. Interestingly, there have been efforts by some non-state actors in Nigeria to provide alternative livelihoods in catfish aquaculture to Manatee hunters. They were given incentives like training and equipment to enable them stop the killing of Manatees. This programme should be sustained.",THE CRUELTY ON AFRICAN MANATEE,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNkYXlsaXZlLmNvbS9pbmRleC5waHAvMjAyMC8wMi8yOC90aGUtY3J1ZWx0eS1vbi1hZnJpY2FuLW1hbmF0ZWUv0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc2RheWxpdmUuY29tL2luZGV4LnBocC8yMDIwLzAyLzI4L3RoZS1jcnVlbHR5LW9uLWFmcmljYW4tbWFuYXRlZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://storage.googleapis.com/thisday-846548948316-wp-data/wp-media/2020/02/e59c8a46-manatee-editorial.jpg,2020-02-27,"{'sent': 'The conservation community is gravely outraged by a recent gory video of an African Manatee being dragged through the street of a coastal community in Bayelsa State.', 'ents': {'GPE': ['Bayelsa State']}}","The authorities could do more to protect wildlife

As the coronavirus made inroads in Australia on Monday, the government upped its travel advice for Italy, telling people to avoid travelling to 11 towns in the north. With Australia reporting six cases on arrivals from Iran and two cases of person-to-person transmission, Indonesia also reported its first two cases on Monday after weeks of concern about the nation's failure to test widely. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said it was no longer possible to stop coronavirus entering Australia. ""Travel bans are, at this stage when we have an outbreak in many countries, a way of delaying the burden of new cases coming in,"" he said. ""It's no longer possible to absolutely prevent new cases coming in."" In Iran, the risk was so high that a travel ban was justified, but in Italy and South Korea cases were confined and localised. ""You cannot stop Australian citizens coming back, some of the cases that came back from Iran with the disease are Australian citizens,"" he said. ""It's a way of slowing things down."" Australians to reconsider travel to 10 towns in the Lombardy area, in the north of the country, where there is a significant coronavirus outbreak, and one in Veneto. Aged care workers or health workers who return from Italy or South Korea are now being told not to return to work for 14 days, given the higher death coronavirus death rates among older people. Australia has identified aged care facilities as a top priority in its virus response, with Professor Murphy to hold workshops with the sector this week. READ MORE: The government has also foreshadowed the use of unprecedented powers to force people to disclose their contacts and ban individuals from attending places or events. Attorney-General Christian Porter told parliament that it might be necessary to use powers under the Biosecurity Act 2015 for the first time to contain the coronavirus. Covid-19 has been listed under that act. That allowed authorities to declare a ""human biosecurity control"" for a person exposed to the disease, which would force them to give information about people that they have contacted or had contact with so that we can trace transmission pathways, and require them to stay at specified place. The act also gave authorities the power to declare a human health response zone for local disease outbreaks or to stop individuals from attending places such as schools, shopping centres or work. ""It's very important for all Australians to understand that there are powers under laws that were introduced specifically by this government that they may never have experienced before at all or on any scale and which may become necessary to use in the months ahead,"" he said. Globally, there are more than 88,000 recorded cases, although Mr Hunt said the actual numbers could be significantly higher, and almost 3000 deaths. Sixty-seven countries are impacted, with the Dominican republic, the Czech republic and Luxembourg the latest to join the list. For most of Italy, travellers are urged to exercise a high degree of caution, but people are now advised to reconsider travel plans for 10 small towns in Lombardy: Codogno, Castiglione d'Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano, and to Vo' Euganeo in Veneto. Travellers are also advised to reconsider travel to Daegu and Cheongdo, in South Korea. For the rest of Korea and Japan, the advice is to exercise a high degree of caution. The advice for Iran and China is ""do not travel"", and non-Australians from those countries are banned from entering Australia. Australians, permanent residents and their immediate families are allowed into Australia but must self-isolate for 14 days. A stimulus package looks imminent, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison telling Parliament that he, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and senior officials met on Monday with Reserve Bank governor Phillip Lowe and his deputy governor to discuss the impact on the economy globally and locally. ""We'll be focusing on ensuring that we keep Australians in jobs, we keep business in business and we keep investment flowing during what will be a very challenging time for the Australian economy,"" he said. Mr Frydenberg said the economic impact would be much more significant than during the SARS outbreak. Australia's two-way trade with China was worth more than $200 billion a year. China was the top market for international students, worth $12 billion a year, and the top source of tourists, with more than $1 billion a year. One-third of Australia's exports went to China. Australia's response would be targeted and not reckless, he said. ""We'll see a responsible, considered and a targeted response focusing on ensuring that businesses and those affected are stronger when they come out,"" he said.

0,"What are your favorite facts about these geckos?

Iranian fat-tailed geckos’ name was inspired by their bulbous tail, which acts as a fat reserve. It can also help them get out of sticky situations if they shed it as a last resort defense against a predator.

This species is also known as the Iranian eyelid gecko, since they belong to a very small and unique subfamily of geckos with eyelids (Eublepharinae). Other geckos do not have eyelids, so they can’t blink!

Do these geckos have sticky feet?

No. None of the species in this genus have the “sticky” lamellae on their toes. However, these geckos do have small claws that help them climb over rocks and dig into the ground.

When are they most active?

Iranian fat-tailed geckos are nocturnal, so they spend the majority of the day sleeping.

0,"ANN ARBOR, MI – A local muralist is facing deportation, prompting plans for a Friday rally in his support outside the U.S. immigration court in Detroit.

Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights co-founder Laura Sanders said Alejandro Chinchilla, 36, is an Ann Arbor artist, youth advocate and beloved community member who was arrested and detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week, “after 19 years of service to our community.”

The rally to support the undocumented immigrant from Costa Rica is scheduled for 12:30 p.m. March 13 outside the McNamara Federal Building, 477 Michigan Ave.

Despite concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, the rally is still on, Sanders confirmed Friday morning.

According to WICIR, it will be a peaceful gathering and attendees are asked to bring signs of love and support.

Signs will feature “Alejandro's amazing artwork that beautifies our community,” Sanders wrote in an email, including a photo of a colorful mural he helped create in 2015, featuring a tree growing from planet Earth, held up by two hands, with the flags of different countries among the tree’s branches.

Chinchilla led a WICIR teen group to create “this beautiful and powerful mural in Ypsilanti,” Sanders said, indicating it was designed and executed by community youth affected by immigration enforcement — “led by Alejandro, who is a gentle and loving person, as well as an inspired artist.”

Faces of the deported: A look at lives torn apart amid immigration crackdown

An ICE spokesman did not immediately have a comment on Chinchilla’s case, saying the agency had more than one person by the name Alejandro Chinchilla.

Chinchilla learned his craft as an artist from watching videos of Bob Ross, the PBS TV artist known for his afro and penchant for painting ""happy trees,” The Ann Arbor News/MLive reported in 2015.

He has covered ugly graffiti with gorgeous landscapes and has worked with hundreds of residents and businesses in the area to beautify their properties, Sanders said.

“What is also incredible is that Alejandro has been with us for 19 years and has never even received so much as a parking ticket,” she said. “We cannot understand the logic in disrupting his life, the lives of his family and the positive foundation of our community by deporting him.”

Deportations, despair and big court backlogs amid Michigan immigration crackdown

He’s currently being detained by ICE at a facility in Monroe, Sanders said, adding she has been in contact with him and his family.

WICIR is asking an immigration judge to at least release Chinchilla on bond so he can prepare for his case and/or potential departure from the country.

Sanders argues Chinchilla’s case is one of many unjust detainments and deportations across the country being “cruelly executed” by President Donald Trump’s administration.

“We oppose these assaults on our immigrant community as they weaken families and have devastating effects on us all,” she said.

0,"Tutorial: A simple one flash setup for amazing wildlife images

By Greg Basco | 15 April 2020

Many photographers, even professionals, are reluctant to use flash in their nature photography. They often give three reasons – flash looks artificial, flash is complicated, flash harms our subjects.

Poison frog. Canon 5D Mark III, Sigma 150mm f/2.8 macro lens. 1/200s @ f2.8, ISO 100. One Godox V860 II flash off-camera with small softbox.

None of these statements is true and, together, they belie a lack of understanding of flash as one of the photographer’s most important tools. Employed well, flash can create beautiful light. Using flash is not that hard. And, while we should take care using flash in certain situations such as nesting birds, flash, as is the case for humans, has no harmful physiological effect on animals.



In this article, I will share a few of my favorite techniques for using just one flash to take great nature photos of subjects ranging from birds to frogs to insects to landscapes. Using flash will quickly open up new creative avenues for you, will allow you to shoot in sub-optimal conditions, and will help you to capture images that stand out from the crowd.

Using flash in a nutshell

Photographers use flash in two basic ways, as main light or as fill light. We can use flash in this way with any type of flash. Though I prefer to keep my camera in manual exposure mode for my photography, these basic flash concepts also apply for any shooting mode.

Fill flash

Fill flash aims to balance natural light with light from our flash. Our goal with this type of photography is to use flash to fill in the shadows while maintaining direction from the natural light. Importantly, we are letting the natural light do most of the work in exposing our subject; the flash is only adding auxiliary light to reveal details in darker areas.



In nature, we most often use fill-flash by placing a flash in the hotshoe or on a telephoto flash bracket to photograph birds or wildlife. Our flash works to fill in shadows while the natural light mandates our base exposure for the brightest parts of the image. This is the simplest use of flash for nature photography.



Start in TTL flash mode and dial in flash exposure compensation between -1 and -3 stops. Fill flash is very easy to learn, and it can quickly improve your nature photos by allowing you to photograph in less than perfect light.



Take these photos of a Collared Aracari taken in the lowlands of Costa Rica below. In the first image without flash, the shadow areas are quite dark. In the second image, subtle fill-flash has helped to reveal detail in the shadows without affecting the background or killing the sense of natural direction of the light.

Collared Arcari without (Top) and with flash (Above). Canon 1D X, 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM lens @ 370mm. 1/2500s @ f6.3, ISO 1000. Godox V860 II flash on a telephoto flash bracket, with TTL flash exposure compensation set to -2.

Main flash

We employ flash as main light when we set our flash unit to do most or all of the work on our subject. Main light flash is useful in the absence of natural light (e.g., at night), in extreme backlit situations, and when backgrounds are in sun and our subject is in deep shade.



It's not hard at all to properly expose any subject using flash as main light. Simply turn on your flash and let TTL exposure take over. Making main light flash look good, however, takes some practice and an artistic eye.

Red-headed Barbet. Canon 7D Mark II, 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM lens @ 600mm. 1/160s @ f6.3, ISO 1600. Godox V860 II flash on a telephoto flash bracket and with TTL flash exposure compensation set to 0.

Look, for example, at the photo of a Red-headed Barbet I took in Ecuador above. The background was lit by very bright mid-day sun, and the bird and branch were in the shade.



I used my flash on a telephoto flash bracket to illuminate the bird, and it is properly exposed. But, it looks absolutely horrible!

Want to join Greg on a workshop in Latin America? Check out fotoverdetours.com or his website deepgreenphotography.com.

Why does this photo look so bad if it is in fact well exposed? When using flash as the main light it's essential to get the flash off-axis. When using flash as fill as described above, we can use the flash in the hotshoe or on a simple bracket with good results.



This is because we can leave natural highlights and shadows from the ambient exposure. Our picture will have depth and will look natural.



When the flash does all of the work on our subject, however, it becomes impossible to create any shadows if the flash is fired straight at the subject.



Direct flash – whether in the hotshoe or on a telephoto flash bracket – as main light on the subject is a recipe for failure in nature photography.



When I have to use flash as main light, I move my flash off-camera and often try to diffuse it in some fashion.

A few years ago, I wanted to photograph a tiny Strawberry Poison Frog hopping around some small cup fungi in a lowland rainforest forest in Costa Rica (above). As with the aforementioned Red-headed Barbet, I was faced with a shaded subject against a bright sunlit background.



I set my camera to expose the background properly. That left me with a very underexposed frog. I used one flash held off-camera and fitted with a small softbox to illuminate my subject.

Use of flash makes a huge difference to the end result in this image of a Strawberry Poison Frog. For the photo with flash, I used one Godox V860 II flash off-camera with a small softbox. I set the flash to high-speed sync and used TTL flash at -.7EV. Canon 7D Mark II, Sigma 150 mm f/2.8 macro lens. 1/2000s @ f4, ISO 100.

In contrast to the direct flash work on the barbet above, the flash work on the frog photo looks completely natural. Coupled with the use of a wide open aperture on my macro lens, this lends the photo a dreamy look that is much different from most frog photos we see.

Examples from the field

With some practice and experimentation, it's not hard to start incorporating flash into your nature photography. With digital, all you can waste is time! Here are some examples of how I've used just one standard hotshoe flash to take photos in the rainforests of Latin America.

Scarlet Macaw, Costa Rica. Canon 1D Mark IV, Canon EF300mm f/2.8L IS USM lens. 1/50s @ f5.6, ISO 100. Canon flash on-camera in manual mode at 1/2 power.

I used a variation of the simple fill-flash technique to produce this unique portrait of a flying Scarlet Macaw in Costa Rica. With a flash in the camera hotshoe, I set up for a standard flight shot but with a couple of twists. A slow shutter speed (1/50th) allowed me to blur the background as I panned along with the bird as it flew.



A brief pop of flash produced added sharpness and brighter colour on the bird.

Bullet Ant, Peruvian Amazon. Canon 5DS R, Canon EF100mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM lens. 1/200s @ f14, ISO 400. One Godox V860 II flash off-camera with small softbox.

For this portrait of a bullet ant gathering nectar on rainforest poinsettia flowers in the Peruvian Amazon, I employed flash as main light.



Even though I took this shot during the middle of the day, I completely underexposed the image so that I could use flash as the only light. This allowed me to stop down to f14 for added depth of field. I held one flash, fitted with a softbox, off-camera with a TTL flash cord. Careful flash placement and good diffusion helped to create light that looks completely natural.

Dwarf Iguana, Ecuador. Canon 5DS R, Canon MP-E65mm f/2.8 1-5x Macro lens. 1/200s @ f16, ISO 200. One Godox V860 II flash off-camera with small softbox.

I used the exact same technique as in image two for this very tight composition of the eye of a Dwarf Iguana in a cloud forest in Ecuador. Here I was using the Canon MP-E 65 mm macro lens for extreme magnification. Using flash as the only light allowed me to gain valuable depth of field even while handholding.

Boa Constrictor, Costa Rica. Canon 5DS R, Canon 16-35mm f/4L IS USM lens @ 16mm. 1/60s @ f14, ISO 400. One Godox V860 II flash off-camera with small softbox.

Incorporating flash into landscape can open the door to eye-catching wildlife in the environment images. For this photo of a boa constrictor in a tree on the shores of Lake Arenal in Costa Rica, I set the camera to properly expose the sunrise sky.



This left my subject a complete silhouette. I worked handheld and had a friend hold a flash with softbox and warming gel off-camera to illuminate the boa and the branch.

Thinking like a landscape painter and paying attention to light source, direction, and temperature is key to using flash well for this type of scenario.

Liana, Costa Rica. Canon 5D Mark II, Canon 17-40mm f/4L USM lens @ 17mm. 13s @ f22, ISO 400. Polarising filter. One Canon 430 EX flash held off-camera and fired multiple times in manual mode.

Landscapes can benefit from flash too, particularly when they have a strong foreground element. One of my favorite techniques is to slightly underexpose a landscape scene and then use flash to draw attention to an important element, such as this giant liana in a rainforest in Costa Rica. I light painted the liana using multiple flash pops during a 13-second exposure.

Reticulated Glass Frog, Costa Rica. Canon 5D Mark II, Sigma 150mm f/2.8 macro lens. 1/200s @ f16, ISO 320. One Godox V860 II flash off-camera with small softbox.

For this photo of a Reticulated Glass Frog protecting its egg clutch in a lowland rainforest in Costa Rica, the flash is again doing all of the work. I completely underexposed the natural light and used one-flash held off-camera and fitted with a softbox.



I used a radio flash transmitter on the camera and a receiver on the flash as this allowed me to hold the flash behind the leaf to create the backlit look I wanted. The awkward location of the leaf and a slight breeze meant using a tripod for a natural light exposure was out of the question. By using flash as the main light and going handheld, I was able to quickly get my shot and then leave the frog alone.

My recommended gear

Godox V860 II

I love the Godox flash system as it’s full-featured and smoothly integrated from their largest studio strobes to their tiny bluetooth flash for smartphones. This V860 II model is the same as a Canon or Nikon flagship flash and offers TTL, high-speed sync, and radio master and slave capabilities for a fraction of the price.

Godox XPro Flash Transmitter

Another great feature of the Godox V860II flash is that it will work with all of its features no matter what camera system you use. Simply buy the X Pro flash transmitter for your camera system(s) of choice and fire your Godox flash off-camera, even in TTL and high-speed sync. Transmission is via 2.4 GHz radio frequency so you don’t need line of sight between your camera and flash. The range is about 100 meters.

Vello Off-camera TTL Flash Cord

An off-camera cord is the cheapest and easiest way to move your flash off-camera for macro work while maintaining rock-solid communication with your camera. This Vello model works well at a good price. I like the

3 foot long version to make it a bit easier to place the

flash where you want it.

Lumiquest Softbox III

This is a great softbox for providing soft light due to the size and the translucent plastic material used. It is a bit large, however, and the mounting process is slow and a bit awkward. It does give great results, though, and I use it often for frogs and reptiles.

Westcott Micro Apollo Softbox

A smaller alternative that mounts much more easily is the Westcott Micro Apollo. The light it provides is not quite as soft as the Lumiquest Softbox III, but it still gives very good results. I use this product a lot for frogs, flowers, and even for my multiple-flash setups for hummingbirds.

Photoflex Reflectors

Small collapsible 12” reflectors are easy to carry and can provide nice fill light when working with one flash. I prefer the silver/white variety. In a pinch, aluminum foil, a piece of white paper, or even the palm of your hand can work as a reflector! ❂",Tutorial: A simple one flash setup for amazing wildlife images,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1c3RyYWxpYW5waG90b2dyYXBoeS5jb20vcGhvdG8tdGlwcy90dXRvcmlhbC1hLXNpbXBsZS1vbmUtZmxhc2gtc2V0dXAtZm9yLWFtYXppbmctd2lsZGxpZmUtaW1hZ2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,http://yaffa-cdn.s3.amazonaws.com/yaffadsp/images/dspArticle/leadImage/greg-basco-single-flash-article-13.jpg,2020-04-15,"{'sent': 'Tutorial: A simple one flash setup for amazing wildlife images\n\n', 'ents': {'CARDINAL': ['one']}}","Tutorial: A simple one flash setup for amazing wildlife images

By Greg Basco | 15 April 2020

Many photographers, even professionals, are reluctant to use flash in their nature photography. They often give three reasons – flash looks artificial, flash is complicated, flash harms our subjects.

Poison frog. Canon 5D Mark III, Sigma 150mm f/2.8 macro lens. 1/200s @ f2.8, ISO 100. One Godox V860 II flash off-camera with small softbox.

None of these statements is true and, together, they belie a lack of understanding of flash as one of the photographer’s most important tools. Employed well, flash can create beautiful light. Using flash is not that hard. And, while we should take care using flash in certain situations such as nesting birds, flash, as is the case for humans, has no harmful physiological effect on animals.



In this article, I will share a few of my favorite techniques for using just one flash to take great nature photos of subjects ranging from birds to frogs to insects to landscapes. Using flash will quickly open up new creative avenues for you, will allow you to shoot in sub-optimal conditions, and will help you to capture images that stand out from the crowd.

Using flash in a nutshell

Photographers use flash in two basic ways, as main light or as fill light. We can use flash in this way with any type of flash. Though I prefer to keep my camera in manual exposure mode for my photography, these basic flash concepts also apply for any shooting mode.

Fill flash

Fill flash aims to balance natural light with light from our flash. Our goal with this type of photography is to use flash to fill in the shadows while maintaining direction from the natural light. Importantly, we are letting the natural light do most of the work in exposing our subject; the flash is only adding auxiliary light to reveal details in darker areas.



In nature, we most often use fill-flash by placing a flash in the hotshoe or on a telephoto flash bracket to photograph birds or wildlife. Our flash works to fill in shadows while the natural light mandates our base exposure for the brightest parts of the image. This is the simplest use of flash for nature photography.



Start in TTL flash mode and dial in flash exposure compensation between -1 and -3 stops. Fill flash is very easy to learn, and it can quickly improve your nature photos by allowing you to photograph in less than perfect light.



Take these photos of a Collared Aracari taken in the lowlands of Costa Rica below. In the first image without flash, the shadow areas are quite dark. In the second image, subtle fill-flash has helped to reveal detail in the shadows without affecting the background or killing the sense of natural direction of the light.

Collared Arcari without (Top) and with flash (Above). Canon 1D X, 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM lens @ 370mm. 1/2500s @ f6.3, ISO 1000. Godox V860 II flash on a telephoto flash bracket, with TTL flash exposure compensation set to -2.

Main flash

We employ flash as main light when we set our flash unit to do most or all of the work on our subject. Main light flash is useful in the absence of natural light (e.g., at night), in extreme backlit situations, and when backgrounds are in sun and our subject is in deep shade.



It's not hard at all to properly expose any subject using flash as main light. Simply turn on your flash and let TTL exposure take over. Making main light flash look good, however, takes some practice and an artistic eye.

Red-headed Barbet. Canon 7D Mark II, 150-600mm f/5-6.3 DG OS HSM lens @ 600mm. 1/160s @ f6.3, ISO 1600. Godox V860 II flash on a telephoto flash bracket and with TTL flash exposure compensation set to 0.

Look, for example, at the photo of a Red-headed Barbet I took in Ecuador above. The background was lit by very bright mid-day sun, and the bird and branch were in the shade.



I used my flash on a telephoto flash bracket to illuminate the bird, and it is properly exposed. But, it looks absolutely horrible!

Want to join Greg on a workshop in Latin America? Check out fotoverdetours.com or his website deepgreenphotography.com.

Why does this photo look so bad if it is in fact well exposed? When using flash as the main light it's essential to get the flash off-axis. When using flash as fill as described above, we can use the flash in the hotshoe or on a simple bracket with good results.



This is because we can leave natural highlights and shadows from the ambient exposure. Our picture will have depth and will look natural.



When the flash does all of the work on our subject, however, it becomes impossible to create any shadows if the flash is fired straight at the subject.



Direct flash – whether in the hotshoe or on a telephoto flash bracket – as main light on the subject is a recipe for failure in nature photography.



When I have to use flash as main light, I move my flash off-camera and often try to diffuse it in some fashion.

0,"The Angolan government must establish a national forestry and wildlife authority in order to stop the rampant illegal bush-meat trade threat to its rich biodiversity, a new study has revealed.

BY OSCAR NKALA

Entitled “A rapid assessment of hunting and bush meat trade along the roadside between five Angolan major towns”, the study documented a variety of wildlife and bush-meat trade that includes rare and endangered species between the cities of Lubango and Uige.

The study was conducted by researchers Francisco Gonçalves, José Luís, José Tchamba, Manuel Cachissapa and António Valter Chisingui in September 2018.

Published in the journal Nature Conservation in December last year, it covered 1237 km from Lubango province in the

south to Uige province in the north.

“During a round trip from Lubango through the provinces of Benguela, Cuanza Sul, Luanda, Bengo and Uíge, we documented a variety of wildlife and bush-meat trade along the roadsides.

“This included snakes, rodents, duikers, antelopes, bush pigs, small carnivores and bird species,” the study observed.

Tree pangolins, green monkey, northern rock python and blue and yellow-backed duikers are some of the most-hunted species.

Wading birds and parrots were observed being sold in shops in Luanda while live species of guinea-fowl were more common between Cuanza Sul and Benguela.

The bush-meat can be obtained in fresh, smoked and dried form.

Live animals captured in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo are being sold in street markets in the city of Uige.

The study described the illegal wildlife trade as a threat to

conservation in Angola, which is one of the most bio-diverse African countries with 6 850 native and 226 non-native plant species.

Angola has 275 mammalian, 940 bird (mostly endemic), 117 amphibian, 278 reptilian and 358 fish species, of which 22% are endemic.

Wildlife poaching and the bush-meat trade are seen as a legacy of the country’s civil war (1975-2002), which led to near-extinction of iconic species like the giant sable antelope.

However, post-war Angola has experienced a sharp spike in illegal hunting and trade in wildlife species due to out-dated wildlife protection laws that desperately need to be reformed.

“After more than 15 years of peace and political stability in the

country, hunting and the bush meat trade are still threatening wildlife in Angola.

“Protection of wildlife in Angola was regulated for many

years by out-dated colonial laws like the Regulamento de Caça,

approved by Diploma Legislativo No. 2873 of 11 December 1957,” the study noted.

Although Angola has updated some legislation and declared all species listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) Appendix 1 as prohibited from hunting and set seasonal limits to hunting, illegal wildlife trade thrives due to lack of coordination.

“Despite progress in terms of legislation amongst different

ministries, there is no clear definition of tasks and responsibilities amongst them,” the report said.

“This resulted in the absence of an agreement on prohibited species for hunting and trade and inefficiency of government authority, which led to uncontrolled hunting and trade of wild animals.

“Wild animals are hunted throughout the year and the bush meat is sold along the roadsides, in the absence of an efficient law enforcement mechanism by the forestry authorities.”

The growing illegal bush-meat trade in Angola was also blamed on the lack of clarity on which government department is responsible for the protection of wildlife and what their role is.

Presently, the ministries of Environment, Agriculture and Finance run separate wildlife laws, leading to some species being listed for trophy hunting in one departmental and prohibited by others.

The research called for the establishment of a forestry and wildlife authority to reduce pressure on natural resources and prompt the crafting of more specific legislation for the protection of wildlife.

Although the actual quantity of bush meat sold on the roadside is unknown, it is believed to be much larger than documented due to scarcity of data on the bush-meat trade and its impact on wildlife.

For example, a number of species observed on sale during the study are prohibited for hunting.

Further, the conservation status of some species offered for trophy hunts has not been domestically assessed.

“Further studies are required to assess and better evaluate the

conservation status of all species, particularly the most frequently hunted and based on this, to establish their conservation status locally within Angola,” the study concluded.

BY OSCAR NKALA

Entitled “A rapid assessment of hunting and bush meat trade along the roadside between five Angolan major towns”, the study documented a variety of wildlife and bush-meat trade that includes rare and endangered species between the cities of Lubango and Uige.

The study was conducted by researchers Francisco Gonçalves, José Luís, José Tchamba, Manuel Cachissapa and António Valter Chisingui in September 2018.

Published in the journal Nature Conservation in December last year, it covered 1237 km from Lubango province in the

south to Uige province in the north.

“During a round trip from Lubango through the provinces of Benguela, Cuanza Sul, Luanda, Bengo and Uíge, we documented a variety of wildlife and bush-meat trade along the roadsides.

“This included snakes, rodents, duikers, antelopes, bush pigs, small carnivores and bird species,” the study observed.

Tree pangolins, green monkey, northern rock python and blue and yellow-backed duikers are some of the most-hunted species.

Wading birds and parrots were observed being sold in shops in Luanda while live species of guinea-fowl were more common between Cuanza Sul and Benguela.

The bush-meat can be obtained in fresh, smoked and dried form.

Live animals captured in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo are being sold in street markets in the city of Uige.

The study described the illegal wildlife trade as a threat to

conservation in Angola, which is one of the most bio-diverse African countries with 6 850 native and 226 non-native plant species.

Angola has 275 mammalian, 940 bird (mostly endemic), 117 amphibian, 278 reptilian and 358 fish species, of which 22% are endemic.

Wildlife poaching and the bush-meat trade are seen as a legacy of the country’s civil war (1975-2002), which led to near-extinction of iconic species like the giant sable antelope.

However, post-war Angola has experienced a sharp spike in illegal hunting and trade in wildlife species due to out-dated wildlife protection laws that desperately need to be reformed.

“After more than 15 years of peace and political stability in the

country, hunting and the bush meat trade are still threatening wildlife in Angola.

“Protection of wildlife in Angola was regulated for many

years by out-dated colonial laws like the Regulamento de Caça,

approved by Diploma Legislativo No. 2873 of 11 December 1957,” the study noted.

Although Angola has updated some legislation and declared all species listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES) Appendix 1 as prohibited from hunting and set seasonal limits to hunting, illegal wildlife trade thrives due to lack of coordination.

“Despite progress in terms of legislation amongst different

ministries, there is no clear definition of tasks and responsibilities amongst them,” the report said.

“This resulted in the absence of an agreement on prohibited species for hunting and trade and inefficiency of government authority, which led to uncontrolled hunting and trade of wild animals.

“Wild animals are hunted throughout the year and the bush meat is sold along the roadsides, in the absence of an efficient law enforcement mechanism by the forestry authorities.”

The growing illegal bush-meat trade in Angola was also blamed on the lack of clarity on which government department is responsible for the protection of wildlife and what their role is.

Presently, the ministries of Environment, Agriculture and Finance run separate wildlife laws, leading to some species being listed for trophy hunting in one departmental and prohibited by others.

The research called for the establishment of a forestry and wildlife authority to reduce pressure on natural resources and prompt the crafting of more specific legislation for the protection of wildlife.

Although the actual quantity of bush meat sold on the roadside is unknown, it is believed to be much larger than documented due to scarcity of data on the bush-meat trade and its impact on wildlife.

For example, a number of species observed on sale during the study are prohibited for hunting.

Further, the conservation status of some species offered for trophy hunts has not been domestically assessed.

“Further studies are required to assess and better evaluate the

conservation status of all species, particularly the most frequently hunted and based on this, to establish their conservation status locally within Angola,” the study concluded.

“We recommend stronger law enforcement to prevent trans-boundary trade of bush-meat and the associated risk of acquiring diseases related to consumption of wild animals.

“We also recommended additional evaluation of bush-meat in informal markets in border posts and principal cities

like Luanda, to better evaluate the dynamics of the bush-meat trade,” the study concluded.","[{'ORG', 'Angolan'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'five', 'CARDINAL'}, {'ORG', 'Angolan'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'Lubango and Uige', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Francisco Gonçalves'}, {'PERSON', 'José Luís'}, {'PERSON', 'José Tchamba'}, {'PERSON', 'Manuel Cachissapa'}, {'ORG', 'António Valter Chisingui'}, {'DATE', 'September 2018'}, {'WORK_OF_ART', 'Nature Conservation'}, {'DATE', 'December last year'}, {'QUANTITY', '1237 km'}, {'Lubango province', 'GPE'}, {'Uige province', 'GPE'}, {'Lubango', 'GPE'}, {'Benguela', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Cuanza Sul'}, {'Luanda', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Bengo'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'Luanda', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'Cuanza Sul'}, {'Benguela', 'GPE'}, {'Democratic Republic of Congo', 'GPE'}, {'Uige', 'GPE'}, {'Angola', 'GPE'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'NORP', 'African'}, {'6 850', 'CARDINAL'}, {'CARDINAL', '226'}, {'Angola', 'GPE'}, {'CARDINAL', '275'}, {'940', 'CARDINAL'}, {'117', 'CARDINAL'}, {'CARDINAL', '278'}, {'reptilian', 'NORP'}, {'CARDINAL', '358'}, {'22%', 'PERCENT'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'1975-2002', 'DATE'}, {'Angola', 'GPE'}, {'more than 15 years', 'DATE'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'Angola', 'GPE'}, {'Angola', 'GPE'}, {'DATE', 'many\n\nyears'}, {'the Regulamento de Caça', 'ORG'}, {'Diploma Legislativo', 'ORG'}, {'2873', 'DATE'}, {'DATE', '11 December 1957'}, {'Angola', 'GPE'}, {'the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species', 'ORG'}, {'PERSON', 'Fauna'}, {'CARDINAL', '1'}, {'DATE', 'the year'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'Angola', 'GPE'}, {'ORG', 'Environment, Agriculture and Finance'}, {'one', 'CARDINAL'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'ORG', 'Angola'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}, {'Luanda', 'GPE'}, {'PERSON', 'bush'}]","['Angolan', 'Angolan', 'Lubango and Uige', 'António Valter Chisingui', 'Lubango province', 'Uige province', 'Lubango', 'Benguela', 'Luanda', 'Luanda', 'Benguela', 'Democratic Republic of Congo', 'Uige', 'Angola', 'African', 'Angola', 'reptilian', 'Angola', 'Angola', 'Angola', 'the Regulamento de Caça', 'Diploma Legislativo', 'Angola', 'the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species', 'Angola', 'Environment, Agriculture and Finance', 'Angola', 'Luanda']"

Hawaii’s state bird, the nene (pronounced nay-nay), once on the brink of extinction, has made a comeback. The state’s only native goose numbered just 30 in the 1960s. With protection under the Endangered Species Act, along with captive breeding and rigorous habitat restoration, the number of nene rose to more than 3,000 in 2019. The official announcement downlisting the nene from endangered to threatened in December 2019 marks a tremendous achievement of Hawaii’s conservation community. It took 60 years of collaborative work and recovery efforts to bring back the endangered species. State officials and conservationists continue to work to keep the species protected in “the endangered species capital of the world.” (The Los Angeles Times, Hawaii Magazine)

Pakistan has passed the country’s first law against child abuse, called the Zainab Alert Law. It comes into effect two years after Zainab Ansari, variously reported as 6 or 7 years old, was kidnapped, raped, and murdered, which sparked a nationwide outcry. The law includes measures such as the establishment of a designated helpline and an agency dedicated to issuing missing child alerts. More significantly, it requires police to register cases within two hours of parents reporting their child missing. Nearly 10 cases of abused children are reported daily, with girls being disproportionately represented. President Arif Alvi signed the bill into law on March 19, calling it an excellent initiative to fast-track missing child cases by using technology. (The Guardian, GeoTV)

In accordance with the law, any person has the right to take a gender discrimination case to court. Although the nation’s constitution guarantees equal rights, gender-based discrimination is still firmly entrenched. But there is political will to change the status quo. Since 2016, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev has been ushering in fundamental policy changes, including changes related to women’s rights. (USAID, UZDaily)

5. Tanzania

The government of Tanzania issued a public statement on April 6 in favor of ensuring access to education for pregnant girls. Pregnant girls and teenage mothers have been banned from state schools since 1961. The announcement is tied to approval of a $500 million World Bank education loan to Tanzania, which had been delayed amid concerns over the country’s treatment of pregnant teens. Tanzania, the largest country in East Africa, has one of the world’s highest teen pregnancy rates, partly due to sexual violence and poverty; about 5,500 pregnant girls drop out of school each year. The World Bank-funded project will allow pregnant students to attend alternative education centers for their exams and later return to state schools. Evidence suggests that increasing access to secondary education for girls is likely to lead to stronger economic growth and lower fertility rates. (Thomson Reuters Foundation, The World Bank)

Marine life could be restored by 2050, says a new scientific review published in the journal Nature. From oyster bed restoration projects to the increase in marine protected areas, conservation efforts are growing worldwide. Numbers of previously endangered populations are also rebounding, such as humpback whales, Canadian sea otters, elephant seals in the United States, and green turtles in Japan. Global fishing is becoming more sustainable. The destruction of seagrass meadows and mangroves, natural barriers against rising seas, is almost at a halt. Still, scientists emphasize the need for tough regulations to counter effects of climate change as ocean pollution and overfishing remain challenges in many parts of the world.

Among those arrested included a 15-year-old boy, 16-year old boy and 23-year old man, all from Chinchilla, who were charged with 29 offences including one count each of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, two counts each of burglary and commit an indictable offence, one count of driving unlicensed, two counts of obstruct police and 21 counts of fraud.

It is alleged that in March, the three offenders were involved in a burglary and theft of a vehicle from a residence in Chinchilla.

As a result of this ongoing operation, 55 people have been charged with 186 offences including;

• 26 x unlawful use of a motor vehicle

• 19 x burglary

• 5 x break and enter

• 7 x receiving tainted property

• 1 x unlawful entry of a motor vehicle

• 9 x driving without a licence

• 1 x evade police

• 36 x fraud

• 2 x obstructing police

• 22 x drug offences

During the operation, speed cameras were also deployed across Chinchilla and Dalby areas resulting in 121 traffic infringement notices.

Southern Regional Crime Coordinator, Detective Acting Superintendent Mat Kelly said this is a great result for the Chinchilla community and local police.

“Information provided by the community has assisted in the success of this ongoing operation. Local police will continue to disrupt and dismantle property crime and drug supply networks across the South West District to deter criminal behaviour.”

Police are warning the public to be vigilant in securing property and to report suspicious behaviour and information about offences in their community.

Among those arrested included a 15-year-old boy, 16-year old boy and 23-year old man, all from Chinchilla, who were charged with 29 offences including one count each of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, two counts each of burglary and commit an indictable offence, one count of driving unlicensed, two counts of obstruct police and 21 counts of fraud.

It is alleged that in March, the three offenders were involved in a burglary and theft of a vehicle from a residence in Chinchilla.

As a result of this ongoing operation, 55 people have been charged with 186 offences including;

• 26 x unlawful use of a motor vehicle

• 19 x burglary

• 5 x break and enter

• 7 x receiving tainted property

• 1 x unlawful entry of a motor vehicle

• 9 x driving without a licence

• 1 x evade police

• 22 x drug offences

During the operation, speed cameras were also deployed across Chinchilla and Dalby areas resulting in 121 traffic infringement notices.

Southern Regional Crime Coordinator, Detective Acting Superintendent Mat Kelly said this is a great result for the Chinchilla community and local police.

“Information provided by the community has assisted in the success of this ongoing operation. Local police will continue to disrupt and dismantle property crime and drug supply networks across the South West District to deter criminal behaviour.”

0,"New research argues that large, legally protected territories are necessary for indigenous peoples to maintain their traditional livelihoods.

The authors were surprised to find higher population densities inside versus outside of nearly half (295) of all indigenous territories.

Indigenous lands provide global-scale environmental benefits. Nearly one-fifth of all Amazonian plants and animals live in these territories, and these areas retain 25.5% of all carbon stocks in Brazil.

Altering the protected status of indigenous lands or opening them up to exploitative economic activities will affect ethnocultural integrity and compromise Brazil’s commitments to climate change and biodiversity protection.

In Brazil, indigenous lands make up 13.5% of the national territory and are home to half a million indigenous peoples speaking 280 distinct languages.

New research, published in the journal Land Use Policy, argues that large, legally protected territories are necessary for indigenous peoples to maintain their traditional livelihoods and to safeguard the global-scale environmental benefits provided by these lands.

“Our paper entirely rejects the often-proclaimed anti-indigenous political banner in Brazil of ‘Too much land for too few Indians’ (in Portuguese, ‘Muita terra para pouco índio’),” Rodrigo Begotti, of the University of East Anglia in the U.K. and co-author of the study, told Mongabay in an email.

The authors were surprised to find higher population densities inside versus outside of nearly half (295) of all physically demarcated indigenous territories in the study. Only 208 Brazilian indigenous lands had the low population densities associated with traditional hunter-gatherer, horticulturalist and semi-nomadic societies.

Using census data and land-use maps from indigenous and non-indigenous populations, the researchers analyzed 587 demarcated indigenous territories spanning a combined 1.9 million km2 (735,000 mi2), an area almost four times the size of Spain.

“These results show the critical importance of legally protecting sufficiently large indigenous territories. Larger indigenous populations mainly occupy vast territories and these lands remain critical if Brazil is to accomplish its international commitments to both protect tropical biodiversity and mitigate climate change,” study co-author Carlos Peres, of the University of East Anglia, UK said in a statement.

Indigenous lands provide global-scale environmental benefits. Nearly one-fifth of all Amazonian plants and animals live in these territories, and these areas retain 25.5% (about 13 gigatons) of all carbon stocks in Brazil.

The study found that nearly 90% of indigenous lands analyzed had a higher proportion of native vegetation cover than their surrounding areas, protecting nearly an eighth of Brazil’s national territory — more than 1 million km2 (386,000 mi2) of forests, prairies and savannas.

“We also find that traditional livelihoods of native Brazilians are intricately linked to healthy environmental conditions and that Indigenous Lands are still efficient in deterring deforestation,” Begotti said.

Altering the protected status of indigenous lands or opening them up to exploitative economic activities such as mining and commodity agriculture, according to the authors, will affect ethnocultural integrity and compromise Brazil’s commitments to climate change and biodiversity protection.

“There is now strong political pressure to integrate indigenous peoples into the market economy by means of establishing commodity agricultural crops and unleashing mining activities inside Indigenous Lands,” Begotti said.

“The justification is that indigenous peoples want to gain access to consumer goods and should generate monetary revenues, regardless of the risks to their ethnocultural diversity and traditional knowledge.”

In 1988, the Brazilian constitution recognized the land rights of indigenous peoples on territories legally referred to as indigenous lands (terras indígenas). FUNAI, the federal agency responsible for protection and demarcation of indigenous lands, as well as uncontacted tribes, has had severe budget cuts, making it nearly impossible to demarcate new indigenous lands or enforce protections.

“For indigenous peoples, securing their land rights is critical to maintaining their collective identity and self-determination,” Begotti said. “Unfortunately, Brazil’s current legislative scenario coupled with a hostile federal executive has only fueled land conflicts and rural violence against native peoples, and increased deforestation rates within Indigenous Lands.”

High rates of suicide and poverty are found in indigenous groups that still lack land rights recognition. Land rights are central not only to poverty reduction but to a wide range of human rights such as food, water, baseline health conditions and ethnocultural identity.

“Begotti and Peres provide a valuable compilation of the flood of setbacks for Brazil’s biodiversity and indigenous peoples since [Brazil’s president] took office as the country’s president in January 2019,” said Philip Fearnside, a professor at Brazil’s National Institute for Research in Amazonia who was not involved with the study.

Now, just weeks after the publication of this study, the situation is worsening. A recent measure opened up 98,000 square kilometers (37,800 square miles) of indigenous lands to outsiders, stripping protections from 237 indigenous areas that had not yet completed the process of “homologação” (final recognition with a presidential decree). The good news, Fearnside notes, is that this measure, known as the “provisional measure for land grabbing” (MP da grilagem), was allowed to expire without a vote, meaning it will not enter into permanent law unless a proposed law that is being drafted for consideration beginning next week enacts the same measures.

The militarization of environmental actions, fires, new roads into the rainforest such as the notorious BR-319 (Manaus-Porto Velho) Highway, and vulnerabilities surrounding COVID-19 are also escalating threats to indigenous lands and people.

When asked what message the authors would like to convey to the Brazilian government, Begotti referred to the words of a famous indigenous peoples’ advocate, Orlando Villas-Bôas. When interviewed nearly 30 years ago, Villas-Bôas urged Brazilian dominant society to respect all indigenous peoples and their cultural legacy, for their ancestral lands were conquered by Europeans in the making of what is now called Brazil.

“Based on this plea,” Begotti said, “we would second Villas-Bôas in stating that we are one big step closer to extirpating a history of at least 8,000 years of ethnocultural diversity of our nation-state and all of its associated traditional knowledge, assimilated over a long process of trial-and-error in rather successfully handling natural ecosystems.”

0,"The COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, the large number of infected cases has grown to spread around the world, causing fatalities on a scale unprecedented this century, until the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel virus a global pandemic.

SEE THE LATEST CASE NUMBERS ON OUR INTERACTIVE PAGE.

Read the latest WHO report here.

Below is the latest information on the coronavirus disease, to keep you up to date.

UPDATE May 26, 7:43 AM EDT: Chaos in Indian airports as domestic flights resume

Two months after they were stopped, domestic flights in India have been given the green light to start up again. However, as citizens flock to the airports to catch flights home, many have been cancelled as certain states are only allowing a certain amounts of flights a day. Many passengers only found out after arriving at the airport, wihtout having received any notification.

Preventative measures were added before domestic flights could resume. Security officers check passengers' temperatures and verify that every one has downloaded the government's COVID-19-tracking app. Shoes and luggage have to be disinfected.

UPDATE May 26, 7:35 AM EDT: Japan carefully lifts coronavirus state of emergency

On Monday, Japan lifted its state of emergency in Hokkaido and the Tokyo metropolitan area, earlier than its scheduled conclusion due for May 31. The government's decision to lift the ban early shows how it is ready for the nation to revive its economy as soon as possible.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe explained ""I made a judgment that the country as a whole had met the strict standard to lift the state of emergency compared to other countries."" Japan hasn't experienced strict lockdown measures that some parts of the U.S. and some countries in Europe have had to endure. The country has under 2,000 people hospitalized currently because of coronavirus.

""The Japanese model has demonstrated its strength,"" Abe added.

Events such as concerts will start to reopen with measures in place, gradually easing as time goes on.

UPDATE May 26, 7:29 AM EDT: California to reopen in-store retail and places of worship

California will be able to reopen its retail shops with in-store shopping as well as places of worship, health authorities announced on Monday. The California Department of Public Health said that these spaces could reopen at 25% of their usual capacity along with other restrictions.

Business owners and religious leaders have to wait for approval first from county health officials before reopening their doors. Each store or place of worship must send a plan to officials explaining which measures they'll take, specifying cleaning and social distancing measures.

UPDATE May 26, 7:21 AM EDT: CDC warns of aggressive cannibal rats as lockdowns reduce their access to food waste

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) has noted that rats in metropolitan areas that usually have easy access to food leftovers and waste from humans are turning aggressive and acting in unusually cannibalistic ways.

After two months of lockdown, restaurant waste, street rubbish, and other food sources have dwindled across American cities, so rats are now turning on each other in order to survive. According to the CDC, the rodents have been turning on their young in order to receive some much-needed sustenance.

""Community-wide closures have led to a decrease in food available to rodents, especially in dense commercial areas,"" said the CDC. ""Some jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food. Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.""

Rats are also moving nearer to humans and infestations have been reported as they make their way into or nearer people's homes and dumpsters in search of food. The CDC recommends ""Preventive actions include sealing up access into homes and businesses, removing debris and heavy vegetation, keeping garbage in tightly covered bins, and removing pet and bird food from their yards.""

UPDATE May 25, 2:43 PM EDT: Italy sees lowest number of new coronavirus cases since February

Italy recorded 300 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, according to the national Civil Protection Agency — the lowest daily increase in additional infections since February 29, reports CNN.

The test data showed a drop in the number of active cases by 2.29%, to at least 55,300 on Monday. The running tally of patients in intensive care is now at 541 — a drop of 12 patients in the last day.

Italy also reported 92 more deaths from the virus, raising the total number of COVID-19 fatalities to 32,877, said the agency. As of writing, the country has seen at least 230,158 coronavirus cases in the country, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

UPDATE May 25, 1:00 PM EDT: WHO temporarily stops hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 trials amid growing safety concerns

The World Health Organization placed a temporary halt on tests of the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment to review growing safety concerns, said Director-General Adhanom Ghebreyesu of the WHO during the opening remarks of a Monday briefing.

The decision came on the heels of a review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine published in the journal The Lancet, in which patients of the virus using the drug were more likely to die or develop irregular heart rhythm — increasing their chances of experiencing sudden cardiac arrest — in stark contrast to coronavirus patients who did nothing about their infection.

The medical journal's study examined 96,000 hospitalized patients confirmed to have the virus across six continents. It was the most extensive analysis of medical records on the drug yet, which happened from December 20, 2019 to April 14, 2020, according to Axios.

UPDATE May 25, 6:28 AM EDT: US adds Brazil to its travel ban list

Foreign nationals who have visited Brazil in the last 14 days face travel restrictions upon entering the U.S. Currently, Brazil is the world's second major hotspot of coronavirus cases, with some 360,000 cases recorded as of Sunday, and with 22,000 reported deaths to date.

The U.S. move is to try and limit any new cases from entering the country. ""Today's action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement.

The rule is that non-Americans who have been in Brazil 14 days before requesting entry to the U.S. will be denied entry. The suspencion takes effect on May 28 and does not affect U.S. citizens, or the spouse, parents, legal guardian, or child of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

UPDATE May 25, 6:19 AM EDT: Americans across the US abandon social distancing rules over Memorial Day weekend, gathering in the hundreds

Sunbathing on beaches and pool parties went ahead as usual for many Americans this Memorial Day weekend, as they decided to leave social distancing regulations behind and gather in large numbers.

At the Lake of the Ozarks, in Missouri, bar tables placed in the pool were brimming with drinks as hundreds of people gathered for the pool party, in close contact, seemingly ignoring anything to do with COVID-19.

Further south, in Daytona Beach, Florida, hundreds of others gathered on the boardwalk for a party. CBS reported that officers came to try and disperse the scene. ""We got slammed. Disney is closed, Universal is closed. Everything is closed, so where did everybody come with the first warm day with 50% opening? Everybody came to the beach,"" Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said at a Sunday news conference.

Total U.S. cases of coronavirus has surpassed 1.64 million, and at the moment its unclear whether numbers are rising due to more vast testing, or a second wave of COVID-19 has hit.

UPDATE May 25, 6:11 AM EDT: Oxford scientists say there may now only be a 50% chance of their vaccine working, as number of cases is falling too rapidly

Scientists working on one of the vaccines against COVID-19 in Oxford have said that because numbers of cases are falling too quickly in the U.K., their chances of a successful vaccine are now at 50%.

The Oxford University mission to find a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus is in ""a race against the virus disappearing, and against time,"" Adam Hill, director at Oxford University's Jenner Institute, told the Telegraph this weekend.

Hill continued by saying ""At the moment, there's a 50% chance that we get no result at all.""

The team's experimental vaccine is known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and its trial relies on giving it to a group of participants who then mingles with the population to see whether they're protected from catching COVID-19. However, with numbers dwindling in the U.K., the scientists' worry is that they'll be unable to tell whether the vaccine has successfully protected the participants or not.

UPDATE May 25, 6:00 AM EDT: Italy reopens its Catholic churches after lockdown, hand sanitizer and face masks mandatory

May 18 saw Catholic churches in Italy reopen after the longest and harshest lockdown in Europe, and Sunday masses on May 24 were buzzing, safely.

Believers had to wear face masks and sanitize their hands before entering the churches, and strict restrictions on how many people could be in the church at the same time were in place. In pews where usually four or five people sit side by side were now only filled with two people.

During the country's lockdown, churches had to stop all religious ceremonies and shut their doors as well. As one of the world's most catholic countries, Sunday was a good trial run to see how other countries may think about reopening their own places of worship safely.

The main conditions for churches to remain open are: reduced capacity, face masks, no holy water, and social distancing in pews. Priests may still hear confession, but not in booths.

Moreover, priests are only offering Holy Communion by placing the wafer in the parishioners' hands, and none on the tongue, as is also usually normal.

UPDATE May 25, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The WHO's Regional Office for Africa provided new training for Tanzanian health workers to grant them skills to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, reports the WHO. A total of 160 health workers locally-based in Tanzania attended a three-day virtual training session set up by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization.

The U.K. will give $3.8 million toward COVID-19 response in the Caribbean. This financial contribution to the Americas WHO Regional Office will assist Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Belize, Guyana, Saint Lucia, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines work to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease, and reduce its final impact.

WHO just partnered with Vital Strategies and other global partners to launch a novel technical primer: Revealing the Toll of COVID-19: A Technical Package for Rapid Mortality Surveillance and Epidemic Response. This technical package for rapid mortality surveillance and epidemic response to assist national governments' efforts in surveillance and COVID-19 response-planning.

UPDATE May 24, 11:25 AM EDT: Russia reports highest one-day death toll

Russia reported its highest single-day coronavirus death toll on Sunday, reported AP. It also, however, revealed its lowest number of new cases in three weeks.

The national coronavirus task force stated that 3,541 people have died from the virus and the number of new cases was 8,599. For several days in May, the country reported more than 11,000 new cases a day.

Russia has stated it has had overall 344,481 infection cases. However, some have accused the country of under-reporting its numbers. Russian officials deny this allegation.

UPDATE May 23, 11:34 AM EDT: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo eased the state’s ban on gatherings in time for the Memorial Day weekend

New Yorkers experienced a welcome reprieve after two months of coronavirus quarantine and just in time for in time for the Memorial Day weekend, reported AP. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo eased the state’s ban on gatherings

Cuomo signed an order late Friday giving people permission to assemble in groups of as many as 10 provided they stay at least 6 feet from each other and wear masks.

This could give New Yorkers the opportunity to picnic together as long as they maintain social distancing. They can also visit New York City beaches this weekend.

However they are forbidden from entering the water and need to wear masks.

“I’ve been really clear about the beaches; they are closed for swimming,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday at his daily coronavirus briefing. “There will not be lifeguards. People are not supposed to go to the beach to swim.”

UPDATE May 23, 10:34 AM EDT: New model reveals 24 states still have uncontrolled coronavirus spread

A new model is revealing that the coronavirus is still spreading at epidemic rates in 24 states, reported The Washington Post. These states are particularly located in the South and Midwest and are at risk of a second wave of infections.

Researchers at Imperial College London created the model. The model used cellphone data to track people’s movements. With mobility increasing and the approach of Memorial Day and the start of summer, the researchers produced an estimate of viral spread as of May 17.

Some states have had little viral spread and can now reopen their economies without generating a new epidemic-level surge in cases. Others are nowhere near this lucky.

The model indicates that in the majority of states, a second wave is very plausible if people abandon restrictions put in place to mitigate the viral spread.

“There’s evidence that the U.S. is not under control, as an entire country,” said Samir Bhatt, a senior lecturer in geostatistics at Imperial College.

UPDATE May 22, 3:27 PM EDT: IBM lays off thousands, seeks 'flexibility' amid COVID-19 crisis

Both IBM and Hewlett-Packard announced serious cost-cutting measures would take effect, including pay cuts and significant job losses, reports Ars Technica.

IBM declared its layoffs late on Thursday. In a public statement, the company said the ""highly competitive marketplace requires flexibility to constantly remix high-value skills,"" which in the case of the global pandemic means a significant number of workers — and their labor — are no longer viewed as having a high value, according to Ars Technica.

UPDATE May 22, 1:07 PM EDT: California has launched its COVID-19 contact tracing program

The state of California launched its COVID-19 contact tracing program on Friday, with Gov. Gavin Newsom declaring a public awareness campaign to encourage everyone to take part, reports CNET.

Called California Connected, the program will involve public health workers reaching out to people who've tested positive for the virus, and enabling access to free confidential testing and supplemental medical advice. Health workers will also offer to test those who've been in close proximity to people who have tested positive for the virus.

Texts and calls asking for people's name, age, places they've been, and people they've been in proximity to will come under the caller ID ""CA COVID Team,"" as will emails. But the surveys will never ask for users' financial information, immigration status, or Social Security numbers.

""We are all eager to get back to work and play,"" said the California governor on Friday, reports CNET. ""We're asking Californians to answer the call when they see their local public health department reaching out by phone, email or text. That simple action of answering the call could save lives and help keep our families and communities healthy.""

Eventually, there will be roughly 10,000 contact tracers throughout the state, but as of writing 500 public health care workers have been trained to use the program.

Notably, this is different than the contact tracing program under development with Google and Apple, which will use smartphones' Bluetooth and mapping technology to track where users go and with whom they pass into dangerous proximity.

UPDATE May 22, 10:36 AM EDT: Oxford COVID-19 vaccine moves on to next phases of human trials

University of Oxford researchers have been working hard on a vaccine for COVID-19, having mostly completed phase I, are now looking for over 10,000 children and adult participants for phases II and III.

The next phase will begin imminently in May and in June, and will include participants between the ages of 5 and over 70 years old, and phase III will include adults over 18 years of age. The researchers will be observing these different age groups' immune system responses to the vaccine, to see whether or not there is a variation in people of different ages.

Adult participants in both phase II and phase III will be randomized to receive one or two doses of either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford's one) or a licensed vaccine (MenACWY) that will be used as a ""control"" comparison.

As Professor Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: ""The clinical studies are progressing very well and we are now initiating studies to evaluate how well the vaccine induces immune responses in older adults, and to test whether it can provide protection in the wider population.""

The aim of the study is to see how different age groups respond to the vaccine and how they could be protected from COVID-19.

UPDATE May 22, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and WHO joined forces to enhance health services for stateless and displaced people, including refugees, reports the WHO. WHO and the UNHCR signed a recent agreement to strengthen and advance public health services for displaced people who number in the millions worldwide. One key aim in 2020 is to support continuing efforts to protect roughly 70 million displaced people due to COVID-19.

The WHO has lent support to the Smithsonian Science Education Center and InterAcademy Partnership to launch a new COVID-19 rapid-response guide for youths aged eight to 17 years old, called ""COVID-19! How can I protect myself and others?"" The new guide is based on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and aims to assist young people in learning the science and social science of COVID-19 addition to helping them take action to keep themselves and their families and communities safe from harm.

The WHO also launched a new search feature for questions concerning the coronavirus crisis. WHO's COVID-19 webpage now features a new enhanced natural language processing search bar, which comprehends questions posed in normal, everyday language, and more accurately provides correct answers to those queries.

UPDATE May 21, 08:22 AM EDT: US colleges planning to reopen in the autumn, but they won't look the same

Big lectures will be scrapped, dorms will be much lower in capacity, and students will face mandatory testing. This will be the regular life of college kids returning to study in autumn.

Even though the reopenings include risks, many leaders have explained that financial and political pressures to reopen are too high to ignore. So far, colleges that are planning to reopen include Purdue University, Texas A&M University, the University of Notre Dame, statewide systems in Arizona, Florida, New Hampshire, and more. Many others plan on making a decision this summer.

In contrast, the California State University System has said that 23 campuses will continue with virtual classes in autumn.

UPDATE May 21, 08:16 AM EDT: Drug maker AstraZeneca secures agreement to make 400 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine

The Anglo-Swedish drug company has received an investment from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop, produce, and deliver the vaccine starting this autumn.

CEO of AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot stated ""We will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.""

The vaccine is called AZD1222, which was developed by Oxford University's Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group. ""AstraZeneca recognizes that the vaccine may not work,″ stated the company, ""but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk.""

Other drug makers such as Moderna and Sanofi are also racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19 so as to allow normal life to resume as soon as possible.

UPDATE May 21, 08:08 AM EDT: European plans to use contact-tracing apps slowing down

Thursday saw doubt creeping up about whether or not European governments will be able to pull off their contact-tracing app plans in a bid to monitor COVID-19 more closely anytime soon.

British Prime Miniser Boris Johnson had stated that June 1st would welcome a ""test, track, and trace"" COVID-19 program to ease the lockdown in the country. However, the government seemingly backtracked on an earlier promise to make an app as a pillar of that program.

In France, the government has had to also delay the deployment of its contact-tracing app. The sysmte was initially due to go live last week, as France eased many lockdown restrictions, but it now won't be ready until next month due to technical issues and reservations over privacy.

Italy's Premier Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday that its contact-tracing app would start in the ""coming days"" — leaving it as broadly as that.

Spain has plans to start tests on a European Bluetooth-based app at the end of June.

UPDATE May 21, 08:01 AM EDT: Swiss company developing UV robot to clean office and commercial spaces

Desktops, counters, and euipment in common spaces will be cleaned by a UV disinfecting robot being built by Swiss startup, Rovenso.

CEO of the company, Thomas Estier, stated ""For me, what was also interesting is that the crisis motivated us to consider existing solutions for disinfection, and then understanding that [those solutions] are not adapted for large workshops and offices.""

""Instead, it would make sense for a robot to ‘understand’ its environment and act intelligently and to better spend its energy, and this loop of sense-analyze-act is the essence of robotics. When you use the full power of robotics, then you can really innovate with new use cases,"" he continued.

The company has named its disinfecting robot ROVéo, which autonomously maps its 3D environment with lidar, analyzes it, and then focuses its UV-C disinfection system just to surfaces likely to be touched by humans. It achieves a 99% disinfection rate or these surfaces, which include desktops, tabletops, counters, handles and handrails, and equipment in common spaces.

UPDATE May 21, 7:54 AM EDT: Shared manufacturing IP could help during COVID-19

Being able to manufacture goods and products will be one way of helping the economy kick-start again. However, most of these IPs are clouded in secrecy, as per an IEEE report. By removing many of these barriers, it will allow businesses to grow up again.

Many companies will be unsure of sharing their intellectual property, even during a pandemic. However, in order to get businesses operating normally again, this is one way of helping them.

UPDATE May 21, 5:00 AM EDT: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey gifts Andrew Yang $5 million to strengthen hand of universal basic income proposal

Billionaire CEO of Twitter and mobile-payment company Square Jack Dorsey is gifting $5 million to Andrew Yang's Humanity Forward, a group the former Democratic presidential candidate launched, to strengthen the hand of universal basic income proponents, reports The Rolling Stone.

Dorsey plans to give $1 billion of his own wealth through a new fund named Start Small, and he announced the newest seven-figure donation on the latest episode of Yang's podcast, ""Yang Speaks."" Dorsey informed Yang that a universal basic income (UBI) was a ""long overdue"" idea to him, and added that ""the only way we can change policy is by experimenting and showing case studies of why this works.""

Yang said Humanity Forward will immediately distribute Dorsey's contribution via small cash grants of roughly $250 to the almost 20,000 people who've lost their jobs or have been economically affected during and by the COVID-19 outbreak. Yang's humanitarian group already gave almost $2 million away in direct cash assistance to assist communities still reeling from the coronavirus crisis.

UPDATE May 21, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The WHO World Health Assembly closed with a global commitment to bolster the COVID-19 response, reports the WHO. Delegates adopted an historic resolution to bring the world together in solidarity against the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHO has worked to support Somalia since the outbreak began to enhance its infection control capabilities, testing capacities, and case management. Training was given to healthcare workers of the De-Martinohospital and 13 additional isolation centers throughout the country, which each also received medical supplies and additional budget support to maintain salaries. But as of yet only 26% of WHO's appeal of $21.95 million for emergency response to the coronavirus crisis in Somalia has seen active funding.

The World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, celebrated annually on May 21, is an opportunity for people to celebrate the world's cultures and the importance of competent intercultural dialogue within healthcare systems. It's also supposed to remind everyone that public health efforts against the coronavirus crisis need a holistic response including vulnerable populations like refugees and migrants in national plans and strategies.

UPDATE May 20, 3:41 PM EDT: More than 100 million people locked down again in northeast China

Roughly 108 million people in northeast China were forced back into lockdown conditions on Monday amid a new rising cluster of COVID-19 cases forcing the country into a backslide, reports Bloomberg.

This came as an abrupt reversal of the general reopening happening across the country as cities in Jilin province blocked buses and trains, shut down schools, and left tens of thousands of residents quarantined, reports Bloomberg.

These measures caused distress in many people living in the area who hoped the worst of the nation's outbreak had passed.

People ""are feeling more cautious again,"" said Fan Pai, a worker at a Shenyang trading company, where renewed restrictions are now in place, to Bloomberg. ""Children playing outside are wearing masks again"" while health care workers are strolling around in protective gear once more, she added. ""It's frustrating because you don't know when it will end.""

UPDATE May 20 11:50 AM EDT: Virtual safaris keep showing animals for locked down tourists

Virtual safaris are being carried out so as to keep lockdown people busy and entertained, all while providing some much needed aid to struggling African wildlife parks that have been hard hit by the absence of tourists.

Ol Pejeta Conservancy has created what they call Sofa Safari that sees workers driving around the park filming animals with their smartphones. ""One of the ways we are trying to be innovative is looking at virtual ways of bringing wildlife to people’s homes, to their television sets and to their telephones,"" said the conservancy’s managing director, Richard Vigne.

The hope is that attention to endangered species doesn't fade as people aren't able to physically visit these animals and parks. ""It’s really important to continue to raise awareness,"" said Ellie Jones-Perrott, a zoology student and creator of Sofa Safari.

UPDATE May 20, 11:39 AM EDT: Hong Kong's lockdown wristband is the size of ""a deck of cards""

Upon landing in Hong Kong passengers are greeted with a governmental wristband that, when paired with an official app, tracks your movements over 14 days. This is the territory's official method of tracking the mandatory 14 day quarantine for everyone landing into the nation.

As per an Associated Press interview, the wristband isn't sleek or small, rather it is a lightweight version of a deck of cards sitting constantly on your wrist. Once the wristband is safely placed on you, you need to stay within your confined flat ,and never futher than 30 feet away from your phone, from which the wristband wearer's actions are monitored.

Not only did the app pop up an alert to the user, reminding them that they ware being watched, but on the third day of the quarantine, a government official called the person to chek that they were at home, and on the 10th day two uniformed officers knocked on their door asking for the I.D. to prove they were still at home.

After two weeks, all the person has to do is click the ""Finish the quarantine"" button on the app, and remove the wristband and they're free to roam.

UPDATE May 20, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The WHO Regional Director for the Americas Dr. Carissa F. Etienne stressed that addressing COVID-19 will necessitate the protection of vulnerable groups like women, underprivileged populations, indigenous populations, and migrants by confronting health, social, and economic inequalities exacerbated by the crisis, reports the WHO.

WHO published a new Case Report Form regarding ""Suspected cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in kids and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19,"" which aims for convenient use by public health officials for collecting standardized data on clinical representations, case severity and observed outcomes.

Uganda has commissioned the first Port Health coronavirus laboratory in the main Uganda-Tanzania border after signs of possible coronavirus importation via truck drivers surfaced. Two GeneXpert machines will see use to test all truck drivers who reach the Mutukula point of entry, where test results will be completed within 45 minutes.

A Cairo doctor described how he became infected with and eventually recovered from the COVID-19 coronavirus, stressing the need for health care workers to practice elementary infection, prevention, and control measures while working with patients.

UPDATE May 19, 8:31 AM EDT: President Donald Trump has been taking unproven coronavirus drug, even without showing any symptoms

On Monday, President Trump stated that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug not yet proven to be a full treatment against COVID-19. Apparently Trump has been taking the drug in the form a daily pill for a week and a half now, even though he shows no signs of having the virus.

Only last month the FDA cautioned against taking hydroxychloroquine ""outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.""

Hydroxychloroquine may have adverse side effects, but Trump said that ""And it seems to have an impact — and maybe it does, maybe it doesn't — but if it doesn't, you're not going to get sick or die. This is a, a pill that's been used for a long time for 30, 40 years on the malaria and or lupus to, and even on arthritis I guess from what I understand, so it's been heavily tested,"" he said.

""What do you have to lose?"" he added, explaining that he is taking the drug as a ""preventative"" measure.

UPDATE May 19, 08:19 AM EDT: CDC launching U.S.-wide coronavirus antibody study for 325,000 residents in 25 cities

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is planning a nationwide coronavirus antibody study of 325,000 people across 25 metropolitan areas, including Boston, New York, and Minneapolis. testing will start this summer and carry out until next year, as per Reuters' report.

The study will test blood samples of donors from these 25 cities for antibodies present when the immune system fights off the virus, as per Dr. Michael Busch director of the nonprofit Vitalant Research Institute. Busch is also leading the preliminary study of the blood samples, and will be testing 36,000 samples.

The hope is to better understand the coronavirus' impact on the human body in order to find an appropriate treatment, cure, or vaccine. The CDC's study will test 1,000 blood samples in each of the 25 cities per month over a 12 month period. Then, testing will ramp up to 25,000 donors from the 18th month onwards. The blood samples will come fro ""regular, altruistic donors"" who donate blood as per Busch.

UPDATE May 19, 08:07 AM EDT: Germany and France join forces to propose 500 billion euro fund to help the E.U. recover amid the outbreak

In order to help the E.U.'s countries to recover more quickly from the coronavirus outbreak, Germany and France have proposed a 500 billion euro (over $540 billion) fund. This amount would add to the already-agreed-upon half-trillion dollars the E.U. bloc signed off on last month.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron disclosed the news at a press conference on Monday, with President Macron live via video conference. The funds would be raised through E.U.-backed bonds and would be put to use in the hardest hit regions and industries. Moreover, it would be offered in terms of grants and not loans, with repayments coming from the E.U. budget over the next 20 years or so.

Chancellor Merkel called for solidarity between the 27 nation-bloc, stating that the current economic challenge ""requires this unusual, one-off effort that Germany and France are now prepared to take.""

As per Chancellor Merkel's statement ""The goal is for Europe to emerge from the crisis stronger.""

UPDATE May 19, 8:00 AM EDT: Seychelles bans cruise ships from entering its port through 2021

Part of the measures to minimize the impact of COVID-19 in the country, the Seychelles has decided to ban all cruise ships from entering Port Victoria until after 2021. The Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation, Ports and Marine Didier Dogley stated that the ban goes into effect immediately and carries out until the end of 2021, as per local newspaper the Nation.

Minister Dogley also stated that the government has taken measures to ensure tourism-related companies stay afloat during the outbreak, or at least until the industry picks up again. On top of salary guarantee until June, other available support include soft loans, and tax holiday — a government program that offers a tax reduction or elimination to businesses.

UPDATE May 19, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros said to the World Health Assembly: ""We have come together as the nations of the world to confront the defining health crisis of our time,"" reports the WHO. As he concluded he remarked that the COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder that the world needs a safer, healthier, and fairer standard of health, and a stronger WHO will support this goal.

Around the world, countries have placed a spectrum of public health and social measures to slow or halt community spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO published a document to give an overview of social measures and public health, and to offer strategies to limit potential harm resulting from these interventions.

A new WHO report on the health behaviors of children aged 11 to 15 in Europe shows that more adolescents have reported mental health concerns. The results were founded on data collected from 2014 to 2019 and give a baseline against which forthcoming studies might measure the impact of the outbreak on young people's lives.

The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific just released a new timeline highlighting key moments and actions taken in response to the spread of COVID-19 in their respective region.

UPDATE May 18, 11:13 AM EDT: Just days after reopening, 70 new coronavirus cases linked to schools have been reported in France

One week after a third of kids in France returned to school, a flare-up of 70 new coronavirus cases linked to the schools have already been reported.

Some schools reopened last week, and another 150,000 junior high-school students returned to school this Monday in France. The move was initially welcomed, however French Education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, warned of the worrying numbers and the 70 schools that reported these new cases were immediately shut down again.

There was no specification as to whether the new cases were reported in schoolchildren or teachers. Blanquer noted that as the incubation period for the virus is several days, it's likely the infected persons already had the virus prior to schools reopening.

France reopened 40,000 schools last week, with classes capped at 15 students.

UPDATE May 18, 11:04 AM EDT: Europe reopened up widely on Monday

Monday saw an extensive reopening of large parts of Europe as numbers of infections have been slowly decreasing on the continent. Museums, golf coures, cafes, restaurants, shops, have all been slowly reopening their doors across Europe.

The countries are now looking at easing border restrictions as of next month, to try and see what can be done for the Summer tourist season within Europe's countries.

Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, was in talks with 10 Southern European nations, and told ZDF Television ""This vacation this year won’t be like the ones we know from the past. The pandemic is still there, and we must at least have safety precautions for the worst case that the figures get worse again.""

UPDATE May 18, 10:58 AM EDT: Moderna's vaccine results are promising

On Monday, biotech Moderna, released the first human trial results from early coronavirus vaccine, called mRNA-1273. A small number of volunteers from the trial showed immune responses that may help protect people from becoming infected with the coronavirus.

Moderna plans on moving forward rapidly with its next phase of testing, with the hope of having an emergency vaccine ready by Autumn.

UPDATE May 18, 10:41 AM EDT: FDA authorizes at-home COVID-19 sample collection kit

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized an at-home sample collection kit that can be sent across to specified laboratories for COVID-19 diagnostics testing.

The sample is made by Everlywell, Inc., and is called the Everlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit, which has received FDA emergency authorization for use. Those wishing to receive the at-home test must first undergo an online questionnaire that is then reviewed by a health care provider. The user will then be able to self-collect a nasal sample through Everylywell's testing kit.

The FDA has also authorized two diagnostics tests for COVID-19, which are to be performed at specific laboratories. ""The authorization of a COVID-19 at-home collection kit that can be used with multiple tests at multiple labs not only provides increased patient access to tests, but also protects others from potential exposure,"" said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

""Today’s action is also another great example of public-private partnerships in which data from a privately funded study was used by industry to support an EUA request, saving precious time as we continue our fight against this pandemic.”

UPDATE May 18, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The ""73rd World Health Assembly"" opened today and will focus on the COVID-19 outbreak, reports the WHO. Member States will give statements and report their progress in fighting the coronavirus, in addition to sharing knowledge on the changing situation and considering a draft resolution on the COVID-19 crisis. The document is available online in Arabic, Russian, French, Chinese, English, and Spanish.

The WHO signed a new agreement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to join forces and promote health through physical and sports activities. The new agreement is especially focused on preventing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This new collaboration is apt because of the way the COVID-19 outbreak is at present affecting people with NCDs, claims the WHO.

Floods in Somalia have raised concerns regarding an upsurge in cholera cases as the ravaged country works to confront the growing number of coronavirus cases. The WHO's country office has since sent sorely-needed essential medical supplies, despite very low funding available for humanitarian operations in Somalia.

Sony Music Latin and Global Citizen just released a new ""Color Esperanza"" track, with proceeds going to benefit the Pan American Health Organization (PAGO) the WHO's Regional Office for the Americas, and its COVID-19 relief projects active throughout the Americas.

UPDATE May 17, 11:30 AM EDT: COVID-19 also affects the toes, say dermatologists

COVID-19 may show symptoms on the skin and particularly on the skin of toes, reported AP. The revelation is a rather unusual one

Massachusetts General Hospital dermatologist Esther Freeman told AP she expected to see skin ailments surfacing from the virus. “But I was not anticipating those would be toes,” explained Freeman.

Now, people are calling them “COVID toes.” They look like what doctors would see on the feet and hands of people who’ve spent a long time outdoors in the cold: red and on occasion itchy.

However, the American Academy of Dermatology is not advising that people race to the emergency room if toes are the only symptom. Instead, a telemedicine check is preferred as the first step for people wondering if they do indeed have “COVID toes.” Doctors can then make a better informed decision about what the symptoms really are.

UPDATE May 17, 8:30 AM EDT: Anti-lockdown protests take place in Warsaw, London

Protests took place Saturday in European cities against lockdown restrictions, reported AP. The demonstrations resulted in tear gas used in Poland and arrests made in London.

In German cities, police enforced distancing rules as many gathered to express their anger at restrictions that are affecting the economy and resulting in a loss of civic freedom.

In Stuttgart, the permitted number of 5,000 demonstrators was exceeded and police directed people to another open space. A mask requirement was also implemented under threat of a 300 euro ($325) fine.

UPDATE May 17, 8:00 AM EDT: Coronavirus spreading across Russia

After devastating Moscow, the coronavirus is now spreading across Russia’s 11 time zones, reported CNN.

The country's coronavirus headquarters confirmed on Sunday that out of Russia's total of 281,752 cases, 142,824 are in Moscow. The virus, however, is now also spreading to other regions in the country, regions that are unfortunately too impoverished to handle its coming well.

President Vladimir Putin said in a video conference meeting with the country’s 85 leaders that it would fall to local leadership to decide whether to continue lockdown measures.

""We have a big country,"" he said. ""The epidemiological situation varies across the regions. We factored this in before, and now at the next stage, we have to act even more specifically and carefully.""

Russia's regions have now begun reporting their own coronavirus numbers. This has resulted in an occasional disparity between the nationally published statistics and local government numbers.

UPDATE May 16, 4:00 PM EDT: Navy confirms eight more USS Theodore Roosevelt sailors have coronavirus for a second time

Sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt are not faring well as the Navy confirmed on Saturday that eight more have tested positive again for the coronavirus, reported AP. This raises the number of sailors who have become infected a second time to 13.

The sailors had already gone through at least two weeks of isolation and had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two, to return to duty. But this did not stop them from getting infected once more.

The incident brings to question the accuracy of testing. There is the chance that in some cases infection can be at such a low level that it is not detected by the test. In that case, the eight incidents do not constitute a relapse.

UPDATE May 15, 5:00 PM EDT: Successful 'real-time' modeling of Germany's COVID-19 outbreak might help other countries

A new report in Science shows how meticulous modeling throughout the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany has provided critical intelligence that might help other countries contain the spread of the disease.

Precision in forecast models for the short-term future of the COVID-19 outbreak allowed decision-makers the crucial intelligence needed to contain and mitigate the effects of the disease on a societal scale.

However, the many data points shift as public interventions — like social distancing — begin to take effect in the area. The new study in Science demonstrates how observed changes in the coronavirus' growth rate matched well with public declarations of intervention measures in Germany.

The three main pillars of modeling an outbreak consist of establishing central epidemiological parameters like the virus' reproduction number, the mass effort to simulate the real-world effects of various comparative ""battle plans"" to minimize the outbreak collateral, and estimation of real-world effects such measures might have — which will allow for rapid adjustments to the model, with the aim of adapting short-term projections.

The data show that magnitude and timing are key when it comes to COVID-19 interventions. Called ""change points,"" the moments when the real-world effects necessitate an adaptation of outbreak modeling to account for changes in the disease's progression caused by interventional steps. And, according to the study, models with two or three change points showed optimal predictive efficacy.

UPDATE May 15, 7:19 A EDT: Moscow residents receive free coronavirus tests

All residents of Moscow, in Russia, have started receiving free COVID-19 antibody tests from 30 clinics throughout the city as of Friday. The program was announced by the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, who explained it'll allow officials ""to know precisely how many Muscovites had coronavirus and developed immunity, how many people are infected or are suspected to have coronavirus.""

Sobyanin said that up to 200,000 tests a day by the end of the month would be carried out, and that 70,000 residents will start receiving invitations for testing ""every few days"". The results will help the city coordinate the work of health care facilities, and what decisions to make regarding easing lockdown restrictions.

The city's 12 million-strong residents count for half of the country's 262,000 confirmed cases.

UPDATE May 15, 07:08 AM EDT: Research looking into whether or not non-thermal plasma could inactivate coronavirus

Associate Professor, Herek Clack, of the University of Michigan has been looking into whether or not non-thermal plasma can inactivate airborne viruses. On top of this, another one of Clack's studies proved that non-thermal plasma could inactivate porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Now, scientists are gathering around Clack and his work to see whether or not non-thermal plasma can inactivate SARS-COV-2, the novel coronavirus.

Clack explains the precise mechanism by which the plasma deactivates these viruses is still being explored. ""But the thinking is that it interrupts the ability for the virus to dock with its host cell,"" he says. ""Our studies show that the number of infectious virus dropped more than two log, so more than 99 percent, if you compare before and after plasma treatment.""

It would take a fair bit of clearance and funding before Clack and his team could start observing and working with the coronavirus, as he explains ""COVID-19 is… highly contagious, with no innate population immunity, potentially deadly health outcomes, and no vaccine in sight—so gaining approval to work with it is not a mundane undertaking.""

There are a number of other research proposals already in the long queue, but there could be a good chance that non-thermal plasma may indeed block out the novel coronavirus from latching on to host cells.

UPDATE May 15, 07:01 AM EDT: Abbott Laboratories' COVID-19 test may be inaccurate, as per FDA

On Thursday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert following a New York University (NYU) study that stated Abbott's rapid diagnostic coronavirus test kit was offering inaccurate readings.

The ID NOW test is specifically giving false reports of negative results. Those who receive a negative test result are being urged to follow up with another test, with another company's test kit. The kit is still giving out accurate positive results.

The FDA is keeping a close eye on the matter ""We are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue,"" said Tim Stenzel, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a statement. ""We will continue to study the data available and are working with the company to create additional mechanisms for studying the test.""

Abbott refutes the study as it explained ""While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport, and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run,"" Abbott said in a statement on Thursday. ""ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.""

UPDATE May 15, 6:46 AM EDT: Cannabis may help block out COVID-19, as per study

A study by scientists at the University of Lethbridge in Canada has demonstrated that cannabis may block COVID-19 infection from happening. The researchers studied over 400 strains of cannabis, honing down on a dozen or so that may show potential in blocking out COVID-19.

Lead researcher of the study, Dr. Igor Kovalchuk, explained to the National Post that certain strains showed promising results as they offered less fertile ground for the virus to take root. Moreover, Dr. Kovalchuk said that ""A number of them have reduced the number of these (virus) receptors by 73 per cent, the chance of it getting in is much lower."" Reducing the number of receptors minimizes the chances of infection.

This is not to say that everyone should take up smoking pot in order not to catch COVID-19 (not yet anyways). The study's results have yet to be peer-reviewed and evidence that cannabis can help treat the virus is inconclusive at this stage. Once more research has been carried out, and if cannabis can indeed work to help keep COVID-19 at bay, Dr. Kovalchuk suspects it would be taken in the form of a mouth watch, gargle, inhalants or gell caps.

UPDATE May 15, 4:32 AM EDT: China has 5 potential vaccine candidates in human trials, with more on the way

China has five potential vaccines for the coronavirus in the human trial stage, with more set for approval next month, signaling the country's rapid progress in the global race to find a viable vaccine to immunize their respective populations, reports Bloomberg.

The five vaccines have so far been tested on more than 2,000 people, and are in phase II trials — expected to be completed in July, said Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission, during a Beijing press briefing on Friday, reports Bloomberg. Phase II is the second of three human trial phases that every potential vaccine must undergo before granted approval for widespread use.

As of writing, there have been no serious side effects reported among phase II patients, added Zeng, who explained that additional candidates will receive approval for human trials in June of this year.

UPDATE May 15, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization Regional Director for South_east Asia, Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh stressed for countries in the region to ease public health and social ""lockdown"" measures in a step-wise manner, adding that local epidemiology should guide collective action in forming a ""new normal"" in the post-coronavirus world, reports the WHO.

The WHO's Regional Director for Europe Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge urged his constituent region to take heed that ""our behavior today, will set the course for the pandemic,"" and stressed how behavioral insights gained amid the outbreak are valuable in the design and implementation of apt pandemic response measures.

A U.N. COVID-19 and mental health policy brief warned that substantial investment is required to avoid a mental health crisis. Reports have indicated an increase in general symptoms of depression and anxiety in several countries.

UPDATE May 14, 4:00 PM EDT: Microsoft, Adaptive jointly launch new study on human immune system versus coronavirus

Microsoft and a biotech firm called Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. are jointly launching a new study to examine how the immune system fights COVID-19, with plans to collect blood samples door-to-door, according to a Microsoft press release.

The goal of the joint venture is to learn how T cells — the expendable yet crucial pawns of our immune systems — help the body adequately respond to the coronavirus.

Other scientists have already investigated the body's immune response to COVID-19, but a Business Insider report says Adaptive and Microsoft perceive an epistemic blindspot in the study of T cells amid other concurrent coronavirus studies.

To fill the gap in knowledge about how the body combats coronavirus infection, Adaptive and Microsoft are reportedly prepping to send phlebotomists to homes of those who were previously exposed to the virus, those who are already sick, and the lucky survivors of infection — for a sample of their blood.

UPDATE May 14, 7:32 AM EDT: Contactless infrared sensors that measure temperature screen people before they enter buildings

Engineers from Portugal's University of Porto have developed a contactless outdoor temperature check, so as to ensure people entering any building are not infected with COVID-19. This will be useful in schools, universities, airports, stores, office buildings and more.

The screening station has a medical-grade infrared temperature sensor and ultrasonic distance sensors that are held up by two 3D-printed metal rods stuck to a 3D-printed base.

The system is simple enough to use: a person stands in front of the station, the ultrasonic distance sensors detect when a person is present and the temperature sensor reads their body temperature to see if they are feverish.

The device can be mounted onto a wall outside any building or public space, markings are set out in front so that a person knows where to stand, which is about 20 cm away. If the reading is high, the system alerts the person to get a COVID-19 test. From start to finish, the entire process takes 20 seconds.

The system is still in its prototype phase, with testing to follow.

UPDATE May 14, 7:20 AM EDT: Google and Apple working together to launch COVID-19 digital contact tracing development

This month, Google and Apple have jointly shared specifications for software developers to built contact tracing apps for both Google and Apple mobile operating systems.

Digital contact tracing lets a user know whether or not they've crossed paths with a coronavirus-infected person. As this trend grows the question of whether or not governments will opt for these apps arises, as well as how well they would work.

The two companies are being advised in part by the MIT-led Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT) project, which hopes to automate contact tracing, and has a large focus on privacy. ""Our job is to make sure what [Apple and Google] implement is as private as possible,"" said Marc Zissman, co-PI on the PACT team and associate head of the Cyber Security and Information Sciences Division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. ""We’re very optimistic about the whole thing, but we still have to prove it,' he continued.

As the teams work on the project, they're sharing all information and data publicly.

UPDATE May 14, 7:13 AM EDT: AI is getting confused because of unpredictable pandemic shopping

MIT Tech Review reported that Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms were becoming more and more confused as online searches and purchases have become less and less predictable during the outbreak.

For instance, Amazon's top searches during regular times involved phone cases, chargers, or Lego. Since February, their top contenders have switched to hand sanitizier, N95 masks, Clorox wipes, and toilet paper — COVID-19 staples, but not machine learning systems' ones.

Humans are now having to realign AI algorithms more regularly by hand so as to ensure they can keep up with the disarray and unpredictability of us humans during these times. For instance, a company that detects credit card fraud has had to change its algorithms to take into account more interest in gardening equipment and power tools.

However, many companies are using this opportunity to improve their AI, so it's not just confusion.

UPDATE May 14, 7:05 AM EDT: France protests against U.S. getting Sanofi vaccine first, and world leaders release an open letter for a people's vaccine

Bloomberg reported that a French government minister called the instance where the U.S. gets first dibs on a Sanofi coronavirus vaccine ""unacceptable."" However, it is the U.S. that has been funding the French company's research.

These comments bring to light an arising issue with regards to a vaccine: which countries will get their hands on the first batch? In light of this, 140 world leaders have released an open letter calling for a ""people's vaccine"" to be available for free to everyone.

“Nobody should be pushed to the back of the vaccine queue because of where they live or what they earn,” said South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa.

In the meantime, it's still undecided whether or not the U.S. will be the first to get its hands on the Sanofi vaccine.

UPDATE May 14, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization published a stop-gap document on Laboratory biosafety for use in testing clinical specimens of patients that meet the case definition of the COVID-19 illness, reports the WHO.

During his media briefing yesterday, Director-General of WHO Dr. Tedros stressed the urgent need for all countries to invest in strong health systems and primary healthcare as the strongest defense against world-historical outbreaks like COVID-19. The World Health Statistics published by the WHO depict the facts: people worldwide live longer and healthier lives with significant gains in low-income countries. The WHO report also suggests the rate of progress is too slow to match Sustainable Development Goals and will be even more behind schedule as a result of COVID-19.

WHO declared the launch of the WHO Academy and the WHO info mobile applications on Thursday. The WHO Academy app is designed to support health workers throughout the COVID-19 crisis while the WHO Info app will help the general public with real-time mobile access to the latest crucial news and critical developments.

Overcrowding in many detention centers undermines health, hygiene, safety, and human dignity, so UNODC, WHO, UNAIDS, and OHCHR have released a joint statement on COVID-19 in prisons and similarly-closed locations to emphasize the need for political leaders to understand the heightened vulnerability of prisoners and others deprived of personal liberty amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

UPDATE May 13, 4:00 PM EDT: Harvard and MIT researchers are developing coronavirus detecting masks that light up to signal

A team of scientists at MIT and Harvard is adapting a Zika- and Ebola-detecting face mask tool capable of detecting coronavirus cases, according to a post on Harvard University's Wyss Institute page, reports Interesting Engineering.

Initially used for other diseases with research published in the journal Cell, now the team is adapting the tool to emit fluorescent signals when a person infected with the coronavirus breathes, coughs, or sneezes. If it works, this might help close the gap in effective testing left open by other screening methods, like temperature checks.

""As we open up our transit system, you could envision it being used in airports as we go through security, as we wait to get on a plane,"" said researcher Jim Collins to Business Insider. ""You or I could use it on the way to and from work. Hospitals could use it for patients as they come in or wait in the waiting room as a pre-screen of who's infected.""

There is a possibility that this technology could be used to do on-site diagnoses of patients — without forcing them to wait for samples to be sent to a laboratory. Testing errors and delays have slowed several countries' attempts to contain local coronavirus outbreaks, so this tool might turn out to be a crucial addition to the anti-COVID-19 arsenal.

UPDATE May 13, 6:00 PM EDT: California man had only 1% survival rate for COVID-19, but walked free after two-month stay in hospital

Gregg Garfield is a California man who survived a 64-day stay in the hospital from a severe COVID-19 case, 31 of which were spent under a ventilator, and on Friday he beat the bad 1%-odds and left the hospital, according to a post on the hospital's Facebook page.

At 54 years old, Garfield was the ""patient zero"" of Providence St. Joseph Medical Center — in Burbank, California — roughly 10 miles north of Los Angeles, reports USA Today.

The man fell ill with COVID-19 and was later hospitalized after a February trip to the northern part of Italy — infamous for its coronavirus toll — with a dozen friends.

""The disease kicked off, and my immune system just ate me alive,"" said the man to a local Los Angeles news source. An accomplished and athletic skier, Garfield almost lost the long fight against the disease.

UPDATE May 13, 7:17 AM EDT: Gilead signs licensing pact with drugmakers to supply experimental COVID-19 treatment

Gilead Sciences Inc. announced on Tuesday that it has signed a non-exclusive licensing pact with five generic drugmakers based in Pakistan and India to expand its supply of an experimental treatment for COVID-19, remdesivir.

The pact enables the companies, Jubilant Life Scienes Ltd., Cipla Ltd., Hetero Labs Ltd., Mylan NV, and Ferozsons Laboratories Ltd. to make and sell the drug in 127 countries worldwide. These countries represent almost all low- to middle-income ones, with a few middle- to upper-income countries.

The pact also enables the licensees to select their own price tags for the drug, as per Gilead. The company's drug received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) emergency approval this month to treat COVID-19 patients.

So far, there is no other approved drug to treat COVID-19, and remdesivir has received more and more interest.

UPDATE May 13, 7:05 AM EDT: Mexico will re-open construction, mining, and car and truck manufacturing

Mexico's top advisory body for the coronavirus pandemic confirmed on Tuesday that the country will re-open its mining, construction, and car and truck manufacturing.

These industries have been classified as ""essential activities"" by the General Health Council and so are allowed to resume work even during the lockdown. The Council has yet to disclose a start date for these activities, but it mentioned that by June 1, the country would have a ""stoplight"" system that explains which activities will be allowed for the local population.

The council also mentioned that restrictions on schools and businesses should be lifted from townships with no COVID-19 cases, that also have neighboring townships free of COVID-19 cases.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador will announce on Wednesday the country's gradual resumption of economic activities.

So far, Mexico has over 38,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and nearly 4,000 deaths.

UPDATE May 13, 6:59 AM EDT: Argument over the reopening of Tesla's factory in California may have come to a close

It's looking likely that the dispute between Tesla and the San Francisco Bay Area authorities over reopening the automaker's Fremont factory after shutdown may be ending.

Early on Wednesday, the Alameda County Public Health Department announced on Twitter that the factory could go beyond basic operations this week and resume making cars on Monday — so long as the safety measures for workers are agreed upon.

Fremont police has yet to verify whether Tesla will hold up its part of the agreement. Tesla reopened its factory on Monday, in defiance of county orders and it's yet to be disclosed whether or not the company will face any charges.

UPDATE May 13, 6:54 AM EDT: Tech company engineers drones to deliver medical supplies in Ghana and Rwanda

Tech company, Zipline, has engineered autonomous drones to carry critical COVID-19 supplies to rural health centers and hospitals in Ghana and Rwanda. The drones can deliver the supplies between 15 and 30 minutes from the moment of delivery. Doctors simply input their requests or orders via Zipline's app, and the drones can deploy within seven minutes. They can fly in any type of weather condition and have a 300 kilometer round-trip range.

So far, both African countries have not been badly hit by the outbreak's impact, and Zipline is still able to keep up with demand. Ghana has reported around 4,700 cases and 22 deaths, and Rwanda has confirmed 284 cases and no deaths so far.

UPDATE May 13, 6:30 AM EDT: No new coronavirus cases in New Zealand for second day in a row

There were no new cases of the COVID-19 illness reported in New Zealand on Wednesday, marking the second day running, according to the Health Ministry, reports RNZ.

The sum of confirmed and probable coronavirus cases remains at 1,497, of which 1,147 were confirmed as of writing. Dr. Ashley Bloomfield — Director-General of Health — said 1,402 people have recovered in the country, up 12 from yesterday, with 94% of all cases in New Zealand now recovered, RNZ reports.

There are only two people currently receiving hospital care in the country, neither of whom are in ICU.

Bloomfield added that 5,961 were tested for infection yesterday, with more than 200,000 carried out to date.

""This milestone of 200,000 tests, which is just over 4 percent of the population, is a significant achievement. I want to recognize everybody who has been tested, as well as the many, many people across the system who have facilitated that happening, it is an incredibly important pillar of our response to COVID-19.""

He also said that Wednesday's figures supported the consensus that New Zealand is ""on the right path.""

""We can't afford to give away the progress we've made. We do need to remain vigilant.""

UPDATE May 13, 4:00 AM: WHO situational report

The World Health Organization published a new addendum to the guidance regarding considerations on adjusting public health and social measures (PHSM), reports the WHO. It provides practical decision process measures to assist countries through their PHSM adaptation process based on epidemiological and public health criteria.

The 2020 World Health Statistics that WHO published on Wednesday show that the COVID-19 outbreak is creating a significant loss of lice, disrupting livelihoods, and threatens recent advances in health and progress toward development in sustainability, and pre-established goals.

WHO joined efforts with the United Kingdom to carry out an awareness campaign called ""Stop The Spread"" regarding the risks attached to spreading inaccurate and false information on the outbreak.

WHO's Regional Director for the Americas Dr. Carissa F. Etienne announced that countries should ""support their economies while building strong social protection networks and embracing evidence-based public health measures that are essential to saving lives.""

UPDATE May 12, 2:50 PM EDT: US President Trump says California should allow Tesla to reopen despite COVID-19 lockdown

U.S. President Donald Trump argued for the state of California to allow Tesla to reopen its electric vehicle assembly plant in California, in agreement with CEO Elon Musk's defiance of local county officials who ordered the facility to stay closed, according to a tweet from the President.

California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020

In the tweet, Trump said: ""California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!""

A few hours later, Musk replied to the President with a tweet of his own, saying ""Thank you!""

Thank you! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2020

This comes on the heels of Musk's Twitter defiance of Alameda County, where he announced Tesla's production would resume despite orders to stay closed from local officials. He also said that if anyone should be arrested, it should be him.

Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020

UPDATE May 12, 1:53 PM EDT: Twitter declares staff may continue working from home permanently

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sent an email to Twitter staff Tuesday informing employees that they may continue working from home on a permanent basis, reports TechCrunch. The CEO said Twitter was an early adopter of the work-from-home model, but added that the push was accelerated by COVID-19 orders to stay home.

In the email, Twitter confirmed the decision to TechCrunch, saying:

""We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere. The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it's safe to return.""

The company is also working on new plans to resume in-person working arrangements and meetings for workers who prefer an office experience. San Francisco Mayor London Breed declared on April 27 that the city will extend its stay at home orders throughout the end of May, Governor Gavin Newsom has already spoken of easing some restrictions.

Twitter's guidelines as stipulated by Chief HR Officer Jennifer Christie are as follows: ""Opening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs. With very few exceptions, offices won't open before September. When we do decide to open offices, it also won't be a snap back to the way it was before. It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual. There will also be no business travel before September, with very few exceptions, and no in-person company events for the rest of 2020. We will assess 2021 events later this year.""

While these guidelines could change, Twitter is more likely to push its timeline back, from the tone of the guidelines. Other major Silicon Valley tech firms like Google and Facebook have extended their work-from-home policies through the end of 2020.

UPDATE May 12, 12:21 PM EDT: Wuhan set to test all 11 million residents after six new cases of the COVID-19 illness were reported

China plans to implement a major new testing regime in Wuhan following the report of new coronavirus cases in the city for the first time since April 3, reports BuzzFeed. The six new cases were confirmed in the same housing complex on Sunday and Monday, and — according to state media — all cases were contracted via transmission from within the country.

The new cases raise troubling questions on whether the virus was eradicated in Wuhan, where it emerged last December, and residents struggled through a 76 — day lockdown.

The government has requested all districts of Wuhan — where roughly 11 million people live, roughly the same population as Ohio -- to develop plans to test all of their residents in just 10 days using nucleic acid testing, according to reports from state media.

In contrast, the U.S. has been effecting roughly 300,000 tests per day.

This comes amid global scrutiny on whether China is or has obscured the true extent of the pandemic during its first weeks and regarding the accuracy of official data currently published on new infections.

All new cases in Wuhan were categorized as asymptomatic.

UPDATE May 12, 7:51 AM EDT: Toyota reports sharp plunge in profit at virus outbreak, but foresees recovery

On Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp. reported a steep fall in fiscal fourth quarter profit due to the COVID-19 pandemic halting vehicle sales and production.

Japan's top-ranking automaker reported a net profit of 63.1 billion yen, ($590 million) for the quarter that ended in March, which is a steep 86% fall from 459.5 billion yen during the same period the year before.

President Akio Toyoda mentioned this was the company's biggest crisis since the global financial crisis, but he said Toyota is learning to grow leaner and to make a fresh start.

The company's officials stated it was hard to foresee what the future of the company held as the lockdowns around the world range in severity and major uncertainties linked to the outbreak could still emerge. But, sales are expected to recover once the pandemic is brought under control.

UPDATE May 12, 7:42 AM EDT: Greece back in recession, moves to digital services for move more quickly out of it

To try and minimize its pandemic-related recession, Greece plans to expand its government digital services. Over 500 services are now available via a new online portal: gov.gr, which started running on March 21, during the country's lockdown.

Kyriakos Pierrakakis, minister of digital governance, told the Associated Press that the aim is to add 200 more services before the end of the year, that's about one per day. These services range from applying for medical prescriptions online, to filing architectural designs.

Greece had barely moved out of its recession, and now it's expected to suffer the worse recession in the E.U. this year due to COVID-19, as its tourism sector, and others, have been hugely hit. The European nation is hoping that moving more towards technology will help make life easier and move out of the recession more quickly.

UPDATE May 12, 7:36 AM EDT: Expert explains that many countries are walking in the dark are lockdowns ease

Many countries are easing their lockdowns after weeks and sometimes months of restrictions, however, questions arise as to how well prepared some countries are as their lockdowns end.

The WHO's emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, mentioned that Germany and South Korea's solid contact tracing measures would hopefully help the countries to detect and stop the spread of the virus before they get out of control. However, other nations have not used such strong contact tracing investigators so as to contact people who have tested positive.

""Shutting your eyes and trying to drive through this blind is about as silly an equation as I’ve seen,"" Ryan said. ""And I’m really concerned that certain countries are setting themselves up for some seriously blind driving over the next few months.""

UPDATE May 12, 7:28 AM EDT: Ventilator that short-circuited in a Russian hospital killed five coronavirus patients in ICU

Russian news agencies reported that a short-circuit in a ventilator in the St Petersburg St George Hospital started a blaze that killed five coronavirus patients in intensive care units (ICU).

The fire was put out rapidly and 150 patients were evacuated from the hospital, as per the country's emergency ministry. No exact numbers of injured have been disclosed, and Russia's NTV news website reported that the fire was contained in one small COVID-19 ward on the sixth floor.

""The ventilators are working to their limits. Preliminary indications are that it was overloaded and caught fire, and that was the cause,"" a source at St Petersburg emergencies department explained to the Interfax news agency.

So far, St Petersburg, which has a population of 4.9 million, has reported just over 8,000 coronavirus cases so far, and has 5,483 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients.

UPDATE MAY 12, 7:17 AM EDT: Finnish team develops vaccine that's nearly ready for testing, and is open-source

Finnish researchers have a vaccine that could start tests in only six weeks, however, the team is worried that once the vaccine is effective commercially, they'll end up at the back of the queue, along with other smaller nations.

""I see it as a significant risk that we won't get vaccine in time and in the quantities needed, rather we'll find ourselves at the end of queue,"" said Helsinki University Professor of Virology Kalle Saksela, who is part of the team of three working on the vaccine. The other two are Seppo Ylä-Herttuala and Kari Alitalo from the University of Eastern Finland.

Saksela believes its important that Finland should have control of its own vaccine production, and not to completely depend on the large pharmaceuticals. It would be possible, as Finland has research and development companies that could adapt themselves to manufacturing vaccines.

The team working on the vaccine are choosing to forego the intellectual property rights to their work. Their vaccine has come from them gathering data in the field, refining it, adding their own observations, and making it freely available. As such, they are hoping to pass the expensive and time-consuming part, which is human testing. Saksela admits this is a risky move, but as their work is developed from existing and tested data, it should in principle be safe.

UPDATE May 12, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization has published novel guidance on Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of the coronavirus outbreak as an addendum on earlier guidance regarding adjusting public health and social measures published mid-April, reports the WHO.

WHO also issued a Statement on Tobacco use and COVID-19. Smoking of tobacco is known to increase risk contracting many respiratory infections and also increases the severity of respiratory diseases. WHO convened a review of studies carried out by public health experts, which found smokers to be more likely to develop the severe version of respiratory diseases after contracting the coronaviras, compared to non-smokers. WHO urges scientists, researchers, and the media to be cautious in potentially amplifying unproven claims that nicotine or tobacco might reduce the risk of COVID-19.

In his media briefing, the Director-General Dr. Tedros urged for a slow-and-steady lifting of public health and social measures, which is key to stimulating stymied economies, while also keeping vigilant attention on the virus so control measures may be quickly reimplemented should another upswing of cases occur.

UPDATE May 11, 4:36 PM EDT: 'If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,' said Elon Musk after reopening Tesla plant despite COVID-19 Lockdown

Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Monday to confirm the reopening of his company's Fremont, California facility over the weekend despite an ongoing legal battle with local officials on whether the automaker plant should stay closed amid the coronavirus outbreak and asked to take personal responsibility for legal gray areas. Tesla called back a number of workers and has constructed roughly 200 new Model Y and Model 3 cars, according to two employees who spoke anonymously to The Verge.

This happened while Musk said he may move the company's operations out of the state amid a lawsuit filed on Alameda County regarding its stay-at-home injunction.

Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020

Musk confirmed the reopening of his Calif. plant in a recent tweet, which said: ""Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.""

Tesla reportedly called back employees previously placed on furlough last month, according to emails seen by The Verge staff. The automaker previously had only told a few workers to report back to work this week, as Business Insider reported.

Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2020

This comes on the heels of logistical threats from Musk on Twitter that he saw Tesla and its relationship to Calif. in a ""final straw"" moment, adding in his May 9 tweet that Tesla ""will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately.""

UPDATE May 11, 12:00 PM EDT: Scientists working to unlock mystery of airborne fluid droplets, transmission of COVID-19

More than 100 years have passed since 50 million people died from the Spanish flu and yet the motion of expelled fluid droplets that carry infectious diseases has gone unsolved, but scientists are now working on the flow physics of respiratory diseases — and believe it could be crucial to containing the coronavirus, according to a study published in Cambridge University's Journal of Fluid Mechanics.

Basic tips to avoid transmission have been the same for a long time: washing hands with soap and water often to remove germs, keeping a safe distance from others, and covering one's mouth and nose with a bandana or face mask.

But now, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Whiting School of Engineering with emphasis on computational fluid dynamics believes more research into how fluid droplets work in the context of COVID-19 will be critical to the fight against the coronavirus.

Simulation of expelled and possibly infected droplets. Source: Jung-Hee Seo / Cambridge University

""I started wondering if there's any data out there about the aerodynamics of these masks to quantify what they are really doing,"" said Mittal. ""As I started to dive into the literature, it became clear that fluid dynamics intersects with nearly every aspect of this pandemic. How droplets are formed and carried, how they infect others, the ventilators we use to treat patients with this disease, even preventative measures like face masks — many of these problems are ultimately related to fluid flow.""

Sneezing can expel thousands of large droplets at a high relative velocity, whereas a cough creates 10 to 100 times fewer potentially-infectious droplets. Speaking alone expels far fewer — roughly 50 per second — and also smaller droplets. These are more likely to remain suspended in the air, travel a farther distance, and effectively transmit the COVID-19 infection once inhaled. Larger droplets are usually left on surfaces — where they contaminate the area and are picked up via tactile contact: with a touch.

UPDATE May 11, 7:08 AM EDT: Scientists looking to use CRISPR gene editing tool to fight COVID-19

Sandia National Lab researchers are genetically engineering antiviral countermeasures to try and fight the coronavirus, as well as any future viral outbreaks or pandemics. CRISPR-based technology and genetic sequencing tools help scientists deeply probe into cells, and now researchers are looking to use these against COVID-19.

The team has been studying emerging infectious diseases for years, such as the Ebola virus and the Nipah one, and has noted that the coronavirus has significant commonalities. So the team is looking to use CRISPR technologies to target a broad spectrum of viruses, and not just one strain.

The team is working on using CRISPR to reprogram cells to block out infection, which would protect the person. The research is still under trial and needs work before being completed, however, it will be a long-term useful technology if and when it's up and running.

UPDATE May 11, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization published new guidance on Surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection, reports the WHO. The new document makes an overview of surveillance strategies that Member States should think of as part of comprehensive national surveillance for the COVID-19 crisis. It also stresses the need to adapt and reinforce existing national systems to combat the virus where apt and to scale-up surveillance capacities where necessary.

WHO also published new guidelines on Contact tracing in the context of the coronavirus crisis. When applied systemically, the new guidance will help disrupt the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious disease and is thus deemed necessary for controlling the outbreaks of infectious disease.

UPDATE May 10, 7:36 AM EDT: Germany to allow cross-border entries for Mother’s Day

Germany’s interior minister is allowing cross-border entries for one day on Mother’s Day in order to permit children who live outside Germany to enter the country to see their mothers, reported AP.

The country’s coronavirus restrictions currently forbid all entries except for exceptional reasons such as work. This would mean that those living across the border could not visit their parents on Mother’s Day.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, therefore, made an exception and approved a decision by border police to add filial visits on this special day. The commuters will also be exempt from regulation that forces people entering the country to quarantine for two weeks.

UPDATE May 10, 6:33 AM EDT: Ailment linked to COVID-19 kills three kids in New York

A baffling illness related to COVID-19 has taken the lives of three children in New York and sickened 73 others, reported The New York Times.

“The illness has taken the lives of three young New Yorkers,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said during his daily Saturday briefing in Manhattan. “This is new. This is developing.”

The syndrome consists of a toxic-shock-like inflammation that can leave children very ill. It affects the skin, the eyes, blood vessels and the heart.

It has been compared to a rare childhood illness called Kawasaki disease.

Health experts and citizens can no longer take solace in the once-believed notion that COVID-19 largely spared children. Any illusion of that was shattered this week when a 5-year-old in New York City died from the syndrome. The doctors described the case as a “pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.”

“We were laboring under the impression that young people were not affected by COVID-19, and that was actually good news,” Cuomo said. “We still have a lot to learn about this virus.”

The state will now be collaborating with the New York Genome Center and Rockefeller University to determine what is causing the new illness.

UPDATE May 10, 6:33 AM EDT: Wuhan reports first coronavirus case since April 3

Local health officials in Wuhan in China reported on Sunday the city’s first new coronavirus case since a month, reported CNN.

The patient is said to be in a critical condition. Meanwhile, his wife also has the virus but is asymptomatic.

In addition, five new patients from the new case’s community showing no symptoms have been put under observation. It should be noted that China's national and local health commissions do not count asymptomatic cases in their confirmed cases.

Wuhan’s borders were reopened on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown.

UPDATE May 9, 10: 15 AM EDT: South Korea, Germany show new outbreaks just when they were preparing to ease up security measures

Just when it looked like things were getting better, South Korea’s capital closed down more than 2,100 bars on Saturday in response to a new cluster of coronavirus infections, reported AP.

Meanwhile, Germany struggled to contain fresh outbreaks at slaughterhouses. Worldwide countries are scrambling to find a soft spot between easing lockdown and maintaining their citizens’ safety. All are trying to avoid a deadly second wave of infection.

Both Germany and South Korea have conducted extensive testing and contact tracing and have been praised for avoiding mass deaths. However, even there, authorities are being burdened with the challenge of finding the balance between saving lives and saving jobs.

UPDATE May 9, 10:14 AM EDT: Glimmers of hope surface for U.S. hot spots

In the hard-hit United States, states continue reopening fuelled by some hope that the worst may be over, reported CNN.

""The good news is we're finally ahead of this virus,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a coronavirus briefing Friday. ""We haven't killed the beast, but we are ahead of it.""

It is estimated that of the more than 1.2 million coronavirus cases and over 77,000 deaths in the U.S., New York has carried the brunt of more than 330,000 cases and 26,243 deaths.

But, Cuomo revealed Friday, that death rates for the state are decreasing.

In the meantime, Hawai reported no confirmed cases of coronavirus for the first time since March 13 while Orleans Parish in Louisiana reported no new coronavirus deaths for 2 days in a row.

This hasn’t stopped the country from being at odds with how to handle lockdown measures.

By Sunday, more than 45 states will have eased restrictions in order to allow a return of the economy while protesters are still demanding that businesses put people back to work quicker.

Experts have, however, warned that reopening too soon could lead to another wave of the pandemic. Time will tell how things evolve

UPDATE May 8, 5:34 PM EDT: Roaming 'robodog' tells park goers in Singapore to maintain social distancing

A robot dog enlisted in Singapore to help slow the spread of the coronavirus illness in the small city-state politely asks passersby and cyclists to keep their distance from one another, reports Reuters.

It's a remote-controlled, four-legged machine constructed by Boston Dynamics, and was first deployed in central park last Friday as the beginning of a two-week trial to learn if it may join other already-active robots currently policing visitors of Singapore's green spaces across the locked-down city-state.

""Let's keep Singapore healthy,"" said the black-and-yellow robodog called SOPT in English as it roamed the premises. ""For your own safety and for those around you, please stand at least one meter apart. Thank you,"" it barked, in the soft timbre of a female voice.

However, behind this kind demeanor lies the threat of hefty fines and even jail for those who breach Singapore's strict lockdown measures.

Singapore holds 5.7 million people, with more than 21,000 cases of the coronavirus infection — one of the highest counts in all Asia — mostly due to the rapid spread of infections between migrant workers living in cramped and crowded dormitories within neighborhoods rarely visited by tentative tourists, reports Reuters.

UPDATE May 8, 11:15 AM EDT: Researchers use network science to produce a list of 81 potential COVID-19 therapies

Researchers led by Albert-László Barabási, distinguished university professor at Northeastern University in Boston and the founder of both network medicine and modern network science, used network science to produce a list of 81 drugs used for other diseases that may also treat COVID-19, reported IEEE Spectrum.

“In many ways, the COVID offers a great test for us to marshal the set of highly predictive tools that we as a community [have developed] in the past two decades,” Barabási told IEEE Spectrum.

In cooperation with ten co-authors from Northeastern, Harvard, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Barabási published a pre-print paper of a network medicine-based framework for finding drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 use.

The paper has not been submitted for peer-review as the authors are awaiting laboratory results from the 81 potential COVID-19 drugs now being investigated in wet-lab studies. “But we are planning of course to submit it once we have [laboratory] results,” said Deisy Morselli Gysi, a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern’s Network Science Institute.

Of the drugs identified by the model some are familiar, such as the AIDS-related protease inhibitor ritonavir, but some are entirely new, such as the antibacterial and anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid, with no COVID-19 trials underway.

UPDATE May 8, 10:15 AM EDT: The Executive Committee of The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems released a statement on AI in the COVID-19 era

The Executive Committee of The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems released a statement analyzing how artificial intelligence systems could both help and harm in the COVID-19 days.

“Digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) can play an important and beneficial role in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. They can help model infection dynamics and socio-economic impact, monitor physical distancing, identify vaccines and help fight disease spread. However, these same technologies can also increase surveillance of individuals and populations and undermine fundamental human values such as privacy and human agency,” read the statement.

The statement went on to explain how important it is to stop the virus without sacrificing our political freedoms. It highlighted the importance of taking advantage of this emerging solidarity brought on by the crisis to build better societies.

The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems also offered ten responses to address COVID-19 issues: New Metrics of Success, Human Rights, Data Sovereignty, Regulation, Widest Availability, Agile Governance, Values-Based Design, Cultural and Values-based Norms, Manipulation versus “Nudging” in Vulnerable Populations, and Mental Health. Descriptions for each response can be found here.

UPDATE May 8, 10:15 AM EDT: Metal copper being used as a virus-killing coating

Reuters reported that the metal copper, whose antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties have been proven by studies, is now being used as a SARS-CoV-2-killing coating. The firm applying it is called Spee3D.

Spee3D commissioned studies by Melbourne laboratory 360biolabs to examine how the coronavirus responds to copper. They found that 96% of the virus was killed off in two hours and 99.2% in 5 hours.

“Up until the end of last year, our business was building the 3D printers, which were then used to build parts,” Spee3D co-founder Kennedy told Reuters.

“Come 2020, and the epidemic hits. We know about the antimicrobial properties of copper, so we thought ‘Can we do something, can we help out here?’”

UPDATE May 8, 9:15 AM EDT: Porsche Museum opening again

The Porsche Museum will open its doors again on Tuesday, May 12, 2020, according to a press release. To slow the spread of the coronavirus, it's been closed to public visitors since March 14 — eight whole weeks.

The museum will restart operations in line with stipulations from the federal government and the State of Baden-Württemberg to protect everyone from COVID-19 infection. This includes a new guidance system for the entire building to help everyone maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) between individuals.

""We also provide face masks and disinfectants,"" said Achim Stejskal, Head of Heritage and Porsche Museum. ""We carry out regular occupational safety training for staff relating to hygiene and conduct recommendations."" The number of visitors will also be controlled via entrance limits.

The opening hours will remain unchanged — Tuesdays to Sundays from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM local time. Museum tours and educational programs will however not be offered for the time being, and gastronomic areas will also not be open to the public. ""We are extending the validity of the annual tickets by two months, by the duration of the museum closure during the corona crisis,"" declared Stejskal.

UPDATE May 8, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization has launched a checklist to help prison administrators and policy-makers take effective and rapid action against COVID-19, reports the WHO.

WHO is lending support to numerous African countries to help reinforce and coordinate the labor of medical teams (EMTs) deployed to assist efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.

Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge — WHO Regional Director for Europe — stressed his worry about the rising rate of interpersonal violence amid COVID-19, and added that ""violence is preventable, not inevitable.""

During the third meeting of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee for COVID-19, Director-General of the WHO stressed that the COVID-1 outbreak is still a public health emergency of global concern, and issued the Committee's advice to States Parties as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.

UPDATE May 7, 11:13 AM EDT: Wearable sensors with pentagon funding to predict coronavirus infections in US military hospitals

The Pentagon is investing in new body-worn sensors designed to identify who is infected with the coronavirus illness — and also those who are at-risk for imminent infection — in U.S. and Southeast Asian hospitals, according to a Businesswire press release.

The new sensors are wrist- or chest-mounted and will use algorithms to analyze human vital sign data to identify key changes that signal early infection.

PhysIQ — a healthtech firm with experience tracking Ebola patients via analytics — leads the initiative that also includes the U.S. Department of Defense, The Henry M. Jackson Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, Inc., and the Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense.

""The second wave [of the pandemic] is going to come this fall. I'm already hearing people talk about, 'How do I bring my employees back?'"" said physIQ founder Gary Conkright to ABC News. ""We think we're working on a solution to that.""

The project will study the progression of coronavirus infections in those who know they have contracted it, but it could also signal those who've yet to show coronavirus symptoms.

UPDATE May 7, 11:11 AM EDT: The coronavirus is present in semen, raising the question of sexually transmitted COVID-19, says new research

A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association found the coronavirus present in semen, reports Business Insider. Coronavirus particles were detected in semen samples of men who had active infections, in addition to those who had recovered.

However, this doesn't yet necessarily mean the virus can be sexually transmitted, according to the researchers.

Roughly 16% of men in the study had the virus in their semen.

The 38 semen samples were collected with the help of a team of Chinese researchers, and of the six whose semen had the virus, four were in an acute stage of active infection, and two had already recovered. The six who were confirmed infected range in age from their 20s to their 50s, reports Business Insider.

""There was no significant difference between negative and positive test results for patients by age, urogenital disease history, days since onset, days since hospitalization, or days since clinical recovery,"" wrote the study authors. They added that they don't yet know how the virus entered the testes of patients.

However, the separating barrier between various parts of the penis and the blooostream is imperfect, which means viruses can pass through it. The virus also causes inflammation, which can affect this penis-bloodstream barrier.

UPDATE May 26, 7:43 AM EDT: Chaos in Indian airports as domestic flights resume

Two months after they were stopped, domestic flights in India have been given the green light to start up again. However, as citizens flock to the airports to catch flights home, many have been cancelled as certain states are only allowing a certain amounts of flights a day. Many passengers only found out after arriving at the airport, wihtout having received any notification.

Preventative measures were added before domestic flights could resume. Security officers check passengers' temperatures and verify that every one has downloaded the government's COVID-19-tracking app. Shoes and luggage have to be disinfected.

UPDATE May 26, 7:35 AM EDT: Japan carefully lifts coronavirus state of emergency

On Monday, Japan lifted its state of emergency in Hokkaido and the Tokyo metropolitan area, earlier than its scheduled conclusion due for May 31. The government's decision to lift the ban early shows how it is ready for the nation to revive its economy as soon as possible.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe explained ""I made a judgment that the country as a whole had met the strict standard to lift the state of emergency compared to other countries."" Japan hasn't experienced strict lockdown measures that some parts of the U.S. and some countries in Europe have had to endure. The country has under 2,000 people hospitalized currently because of coronavirus.

""The Japanese model has demonstrated its strength,"" Abe added.

Events such as concerts will start to reopen with measures in place, gradually easing as time goes on.

UPDATE May 26, 7:29 AM EDT: California to reopen in-store retail and places of worship

California will be able to reopen its retail shops with in-store shopping as well as places of worship, health authorities announced on Monday. The California Department of Public Health said that these spaces could reopen at 25% of their usual capacity along with other restrictions.

Business owners and religious leaders have to wait for approval first from county health officials before reopening their doors. Each store or place of worship must send a plan to officials explaining which measures they'll take, specifying cleaning and social distancing measures.

UPDATE May 26, 7:21 AM EDT: CDC warns of aggressive cannibal rats as lockdowns reduce their access to food waste

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and and Prevention (CDC) has noted that rats in metropolitan areas that usually have easy access to food leftovers and waste from humans are turning aggressive and acting in unusually cannibalistic ways.

After two months of lockdown, restaurant waste, street rubbish, and other food sources have dwindled across American cities, so rats are now turning on each other in order to survive. According to the CDC, the rodents have been turning on their young in order to receive some much-needed sustenance.

""Community-wide closures have led to a decrease in food available to rodents, especially in dense commercial areas,"" said the CDC. ""Some jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food. Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.""

Rats are also moving nearer to humans and infestations have been reported as they make their way into or nearer people's homes and dumpsters in search of food. The CDC recommends ""Preventive actions include sealing up access into homes and businesses, removing debris and heavy vegetation, keeping garbage in tightly covered bins, and removing pet and bird food from their yards.""

UPDATE May 25, 2:43 PM EDT: Italy sees lowest number of new coronavirus cases since February

Italy recorded 300 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, according to the national Civil Protection Agency — the lowest daily increase in additional infections since February 29, reports CNN.

The test data showed a drop in the number of active cases by 2.29%, to at least 55,300 on Monday. The running tally of patients in intensive care is now at 541 — a drop of 12 patients in the last day.

Italy also reported 92 more deaths from the virus, raising the total number of COVID-19 fatalities to 32,877, said the agency. As of writing, the country has seen at least 230,158 coronavirus cases in the country, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally.

UPDATE May 25, 1:00 PM EDT: WHO temporarily stops hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 trials amid growing safety concerns

The World Health Organization placed a temporary halt on tests of the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine as a potential coronavirus treatment to review growing safety concerns, said Director-General Adhanom Ghebreyesu of the WHO during the opening remarks of a Monday briefing.

The decision came on the heels of a review of the effects of hydroxychloroquine published in the journal The Lancet, in which patients of the virus using the drug were more likely to die or develop irregular heart rhythm — increasing their chances of experiencing sudden cardiac arrest — in stark contrast to coronavirus patients who did nothing about their infection.

The medical journal's study examined 96,000 hospitalized patients confirmed to have the virus across six continents. It was the most extensive analysis of medical records on the drug yet, which happened from December 20, 2019 to April 14, 2020, according to Axios.

UPDATE May 25, 6:28 AM EDT: US adds Brazil to its travel ban list

Foreign nationals who have visited Brazil in the last 14 days face travel restrictions upon entering the U.S. Currently, Brazil is the world's second major hotspot of coronavirus cases, with some 360,000 cases recorded as of Sunday, and with 22,000 reported deaths to date.

The U.S. move is to try and limit any new cases from entering the country. ""Today's action will help ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country,"" White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said in a statement.

The rule is that non-Americans who have been in Brazil 14 days before requesting entry to the U.S. will be denied entry. The suspencion takes effect on May 28 and does not affect U.S. citizens, or the spouse, parents, legal guardian, or child of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.

UPDATE May 25, 6:19 AM EDT: Americans across the US abandon social distancing rules over Memorial Day weekend, gathering in the hundreds

Sunbathing on beaches and pool parties went ahead as usual for many Americans this Memorial Day weekend, as they decided to leave social distancing regulations behind and gather in large numbers.

At the Lake of the Ozarks, in Missouri, bar tables placed in the pool were brimming with drinks as hundreds of people gathered for the pool party, in close contact, seemingly ignoring anything to do with COVID-19.

Further south, in Daytona Beach, Florida, hundreds of others gathered on the boardwalk for a party. CBS reported that officers came to try and disperse the scene. ""We got slammed. Disney is closed, Universal is closed. Everything is closed, so where did everybody come with the first warm day with 50% opening? Everybody came to the beach,"" Volusia County Sheriff Mike Chitwood said at a Sunday news conference.

Total U.S. cases of coronavirus has surpassed 1.64 million, and at the moment its unclear whether numbers are rising due to more vast testing, or a second wave of COVID-19 has hit.

UPDATE May 25, 6:11 AM EDT: Oxford scientists say there may now only be a 50% chance of their vaccine working, as number of cases is falling too rapidly

Scientists working on one of the vaccines against COVID-19 in Oxford have said that because numbers of cases are falling too quickly in the U.K., their chances of a successful vaccine are now at 50%.

The Oxford University mission to find a vaccine for the COVID-19 virus is in ""a race against the virus disappearing, and against time,"" Adam Hill, director at Oxford University's Jenner Institute, told the Telegraph this weekend.

Hill continued by saying ""At the moment, there's a 50% chance that we get no result at all.""

The team's experimental vaccine is known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, and its trial relies on giving it to a group of participants who then mingles with the population to see whether they're protected from catching COVID-19. However, with numbers dwindling in the U.K., the scientists' worry is that they'll be unable to tell whether the vaccine has successfully protected the participants or not.

UPDATE May 25, 6:00 AM EDT: Italy reopens its Catholic churches after lockdown, hand sanitizer and face masks mandatory

May 18 saw Catholic churches in Italy reopen after the longest and harshest lockdown in Europe, and Sunday masses on May 24 were buzzing, safely.

Believers had to wear face masks and sanitize their hands before entering the churches, and strict restrictions on how many people could be in the church at the same time were in place. In pews where usually four or five people sit side by side were now only filled with two people.

During the country's lockdown, churches had to stop all religious ceremonies and shut their doors as well. As one of the world's most catholic countries, Sunday was a good trial run to see how other countries may think about reopening their own places of worship safely.

The main conditions for churches to remain open are: reduced capacity, face masks, no holy water, and social distancing in pews. Priests may still hear confession, but not in booths.

Moreover, priests are only offering Holy Communion by placing the wafer in the parishioners' hands, and none on the tongue, as is also usually normal.

UPDATE May 25, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The WHO's Regional Office for Africa provided new training for Tanzanian health workers to grant them skills to care for critically ill COVID-19 patients, reports the WHO. A total of 160 health workers locally-based in Tanzania attended a three-day virtual training session set up by the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization.

The U.K. will give $3.8 million toward COVID-19 response in the Caribbean. This financial contribution to the Americas WHO Regional Office will assist Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Belize, Guyana, Saint Lucia, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines work to contain the spread of the COVID-19 disease, and reduce its final impact.

WHO just partnered with Vital Strategies and other global partners to launch a novel technical primer: Revealing the Toll of COVID-19: A Technical Package for Rapid Mortality Surveillance and Epidemic Response. This technical package for rapid mortality surveillance and epidemic response to assist national governments' efforts in surveillance and COVID-19 response-planning.

UPDATE May 24, 11:25 AM EDT: Russia reports highest one-day death toll

Russia reported its highest single-day coronavirus death toll on Sunday, reported AP. It also, however, revealed its lowest number of new cases in three weeks.

The national coronavirus task force stated that 3,541 people have died from the virus and the number of new cases was 8,599. For several days in May, the country reported more than 11,000 new cases a day.

Russia has stated it has had overall 344,481 infection cases. However, some have accused the country of under-reporting its numbers. Russian officials deny this allegation.

UPDATE May 23, 11:34 AM EDT: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo eased the state’s ban on gatherings in time for the Memorial Day weekend

New Yorkers experienced a welcome reprieve after two months of coronavirus quarantine and just in time for in time for the Memorial Day weekend, reported AP. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo eased the state’s ban on gatherings

Cuomo signed an order late Friday giving people permission to assemble in groups of as many as 10 provided they stay at least 6 feet from each other and wear masks.

This could give New Yorkers the opportunity to picnic together as long as they maintain social distancing. They can also visit New York City beaches this weekend.

However they are forbidden from entering the water and need to wear masks.

“I’ve been really clear about the beaches; they are closed for swimming,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday at his daily coronavirus briefing. “There will not be lifeguards. People are not supposed to go to the beach to swim.”

UPDATE May 23, 10:34 AM EDT: New model reveals 24 states still have uncontrolled coronavirus spread

A new model is revealing that the coronavirus is still spreading at epidemic rates in 24 states, reported The Washington Post. These states are particularly located in the South and Midwest and are at risk of a second wave of infections.

Researchers at Imperial College London created the model. The model used cellphone data to track people’s movements. With mobility increasing and the approach of Memorial Day and the start of summer, the researchers produced an estimate of viral spread as of May 17.

Some states have had little viral spread and can now reopen their economies without generating a new epidemic-level surge in cases. Others are nowhere near this lucky.

The model indicates that in the majority of states, a second wave is very plausible if people abandon restrictions put in place to mitigate the viral spread.

“There’s evidence that the U.S. is not under control, as an entire country,” said Samir Bhatt, a senior lecturer in geostatistics at Imperial College.

UPDATE May 22, 3:27 PM EDT: IBM lays off thousands, seeks 'flexibility' amid COVID-19 crisis

Both IBM and Hewlett-Packard announced serious cost-cutting measures would take effect, including pay cuts and significant job losses, reports Ars Technica.

IBM declared its layoffs late on Thursday. In a public statement, the company said the ""highly competitive marketplace requires flexibility to constantly remix high-value skills,"" which in the case of the global pandemic means a significant number of workers — and their labor — are no longer viewed as having a high value, according to Ars Technica.

UPDATE May 22, 1:07 PM EDT: California has launched its COVID-19 contact tracing program

The state of California launched its COVID-19 contact tracing program on Friday, with Gov. Gavin Newsom declaring a public awareness campaign to encourage everyone to take part, reports CNET.

Called California Connected, the program will involve public health workers reaching out to people who've tested positive for the virus, and enabling access to free confidential testing and supplemental medical advice. Health workers will also offer to test those who've been in close proximity to people who have tested positive for the virus.

Texts and calls asking for people's name, age, places they've been, and people they've been in proximity to will come under the caller ID ""CA COVID Team,"" as will emails. But the surveys will never ask for users' financial information, immigration status, or Social Security numbers.

""We are all eager to get back to work and play,"" said the California governor on Friday, reports CNET. ""We're asking Californians to answer the call when they see their local public health department reaching out by phone, email or text. That simple action of answering the call could save lives and help keep our families and communities healthy.""

Eventually, there will be roughly 10,000 contact tracers throughout the state, but as of writing 500 public health care workers have been trained to use the program.

Notably, this is different than the contact tracing program under development with Google and Apple, which will use smartphones' Bluetooth and mapping technology to track where users go and with whom they pass into dangerous proximity.

UPDATE May 22, 10:36 AM EDT: Oxford COVID-19 vaccine moves on to next phases of human trials

University of Oxford researchers have been working hard on a vaccine for COVID-19, having mostly completed phase I, are now looking for over 10,000 children and adult participants for phases II and III.

The next phase will begin imminently in May and in June, and will include participants between the ages of 5 and over 70 years old, and phase III will include adults over 18 years of age. The researchers will be observing these different age groups' immune system responses to the vaccine, to see whether or not there is a variation in people of different ages.

Adult participants in both phase II and phase III will be randomized to receive one or two doses of either the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (Oxford's one) or a licensed vaccine (MenACWY) that will be used as a ""control"" comparison.

As Professor Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said: ""The clinical studies are progressing very well and we are now initiating studies to evaluate how well the vaccine induces immune responses in older adults, and to test whether it can provide protection in the wider population.""

The aim of the study is to see how different age groups respond to the vaccine and how they could be protected from COVID-19.

UPDATE May 22, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and WHO joined forces to enhance health services for stateless and displaced people, including refugees, reports the WHO. WHO and the UNHCR signed a recent agreement to strengthen and advance public health services for displaced people who number in the millions worldwide. One key aim in 2020 is to support continuing efforts to protect roughly 70 million displaced people due to COVID-19.

The WHO has lent support to the Smithsonian Science Education Center and InterAcademy Partnership to launch a new COVID-19 rapid-response guide for youths aged eight to 17 years old, called ""COVID-19! How can I protect myself and others?"" The new guide is based on the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and aims to assist young people in learning the science and social science of COVID-19 addition to helping them take action to keep themselves and their families and communities safe from harm.

The WHO also launched a new search feature for questions concerning the coronavirus crisis. WHO's COVID-19 webpage now features a new enhanced natural language processing search bar, which comprehends questions posed in normal, everyday language, and more accurately provides correct answers to those queries.

UPDATE May 21, 08:22 AM EDT: US colleges planning to reopen in the autumn, but they won't look the same

Big lectures will be scrapped, dorms will be much lower in capacity, and students will face mandatory testing. This will be the regular life of college kids returning to study in autumn.

Even though the reopenings include risks, many leaders have explained that financial and political pressures to reopen are too high to ignore. So far, colleges that are planning to reopen include Purdue University, Texas A&M University, the University of Notre Dame, statewide systems in Arizona, Florida, New Hampshire, and more. Many others plan on making a decision this summer.

In contrast, the California State University System has said that 23 campuses will continue with virtual classes in autumn.

UPDATE May 21, 08:16 AM EDT: Drug maker AstraZeneca secures agreement to make 400 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine

The Anglo-Swedish drug company has received an investment from the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to develop, produce, and deliver the vaccine starting this autumn.

CEO of AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot stated ""We will do everything in our power to make this vaccine quickly and widely available.""

The vaccine is called AZD1222, which was developed by Oxford University's Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group. ""AstraZeneca recognizes that the vaccine may not work,″ stated the company, ""but is committed to progressing the clinical program with speed and scaling up manufacturing at risk.""

Other drug makers such as Moderna and Sanofi are also racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19 so as to allow normal life to resume as soon as possible.

UPDATE May 21, 08:08 AM EDT: European plans to use contact-tracing apps slowing down

Thursday saw doubt creeping up about whether or not European governments will be able to pull off their contact-tracing app plans in a bid to monitor COVID-19 more closely anytime soon.

British Prime Miniser Boris Johnson had stated that June 1st would welcome a ""test, track, and trace"" COVID-19 program to ease the lockdown in the country. However, the government seemingly backtracked on an earlier promise to make an app as a pillar of that program.

In France, the government has had to also delay the deployment of its contact-tracing app. The sysmte was initially due to go live last week, as France eased many lockdown restrictions, but it now won't be ready until next month due to technical issues and reservations over privacy.

Italy's Premier Giuseppe Conte said on Thursday that its contact-tracing app would start in the ""coming days"" — leaving it as broadly as that.

Spain has plans to start tests on a European Bluetooth-based app at the end of June.

UPDATE May 21, 08:01 AM EDT: Swiss company developing UV robot to clean office and commercial spaces

Desktops, counters, and euipment in common spaces will be cleaned by a UV disinfecting robot being built by Swiss startup, Rovenso.

CEO of the company, Thomas Estier, stated ""For me, what was also interesting is that the crisis motivated us to consider existing solutions for disinfection, and then understanding that [those solutions] are not adapted for large workshops and offices.""

""Instead, it would make sense for a robot to ‘understand’ its environment and act intelligently and to better spend its energy, and this loop of sense-analyze-act is the essence of robotics. When you use the full power of robotics, then you can really innovate with new use cases,"" he continued.

The company has named its disinfecting robot ROVéo, which autonomously maps its 3D environment with lidar, analyzes it, and then focuses its UV-C disinfection system just to surfaces likely to be touched by humans. It achieves a 99% disinfection rate or these surfaces, which include desktops, tabletops, counters, handles and handrails, and equipment in common spaces.

UPDATE May 21, 7:54 AM EDT: Shared manufacturing IP could help during COVID-19

Being able to manufacture goods and products will be one way of helping the economy kick-start again. However, most of these IPs are clouded in secrecy, as per an IEEE report. By removing many of these barriers, it will allow businesses to grow up again.

Many companies will be unsure of sharing their intellectual property, even during a pandemic. However, in order to get businesses operating normally again, this is one way of helping them.

UPDATE May 21, 5:00 AM EDT: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey gifts Andrew Yang $5 million to strengthen hand of universal basic income proposal

Billionaire CEO of Twitter and mobile-payment company Square Jack Dorsey is gifting $5 million to Andrew Yang's Humanity Forward, a group the former Democratic presidential candidate launched, to strengthen the hand of universal basic income proponents, reports The Rolling Stone.

Dorsey plans to give $1 billion of his own wealth through a new fund named Start Small, and he announced the newest seven-figure donation on the latest episode of Yang's podcast, ""Yang Speaks."" Dorsey informed Yang that a universal basic income (UBI) was a ""long overdue"" idea to him, and added that ""the only way we can change policy is by experimenting and showing case studies of why this works.""

Yang said Humanity Forward will immediately distribute Dorsey's contribution via small cash grants of roughly $250 to the almost 20,000 people who've lost their jobs or have been economically affected during and by the COVID-19 outbreak. Yang's humanitarian group already gave almost $2 million away in direct cash assistance to assist communities still reeling from the coronavirus crisis.

UPDATE May 21, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The WHO World Health Assembly closed with a global commitment to bolster the COVID-19 response, reports the WHO. Delegates adopted an historic resolution to bring the world together in solidarity against the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHO has worked to support Somalia since the outbreak began to enhance its infection control capabilities, testing capacities, and case management. Training was given to healthcare workers of the De-Martinohospital and 13 additional isolation centers throughout the country, which each also received medical supplies and additional budget support to maintain salaries. But as of yet only 26% of WHO's appeal of $21.95 million for emergency response to the coronavirus crisis in Somalia has seen active funding.

The World Day for Cultural Diversity for Dialogue and Development, celebrated annually on May 21, is an opportunity for people to celebrate the world's cultures and the importance of competent intercultural dialogue within healthcare systems. It's also supposed to remind everyone that public health efforts against the coronavirus crisis need a holistic response including vulnerable populations like refugees and migrants in national plans and strategies.

UPDATE May 20, 3:41 PM EDT: More than 100 million people locked down again in northeast China

Roughly 108 million people in northeast China were forced back into lockdown conditions on Monday amid a new rising cluster of COVID-19 cases forcing the country into a backslide, reports Bloomberg.

This came as an abrupt reversal of the general reopening happening across the country as cities in Jilin province blocked buses and trains, shut down schools, and left tens of thousands of residents quarantined, reports Bloomberg.

These measures caused distress in many people living in the area who hoped the worst of the nation's outbreak had passed.

People ""are feeling more cautious again,"" said Fan Pai, a worker at a Shenyang trading company, where renewed restrictions are now in place, to Bloomberg. ""Children playing outside are wearing masks again"" while health care workers are strolling around in protective gear once more, she added. ""It's frustrating because you don't know when it will end.""

UPDATE May 20 11:50 AM EDT: Virtual safaris keep showing animals for locked down tourists

Virtual safaris are being carried out so as to keep lockdown people busy and entertained, all while providing some much needed aid to struggling African wildlife parks that have been hard hit by the absence of tourists.

Ol Pejeta Conservancy has created what they call Sofa Safari that sees workers driving around the park filming animals with their smartphones. ""One of the ways we are trying to be innovative is looking at virtual ways of bringing wildlife to people’s homes, to their television sets and to their telephones,"" said the conservancy’s managing director, Richard Vigne.

The hope is that attention to endangered species doesn't fade as people aren't able to physically visit these animals and parks. ""It’s really important to continue to raise awareness,"" said Ellie Jones-Perrott, a zoology student and creator of Sofa Safari.

UPDATE May 20, 11:39 AM EDT: Hong Kong's lockdown wristband is the size of ""a deck of cards""

Upon landing in Hong Kong passengers are greeted with a governmental wristband that, when paired with an official app, tracks your movements over 14 days. This is the territory's official method of tracking the mandatory 14 day quarantine for everyone landing into the nation.

As per an Associated Press interview, the wristband isn't sleek or small, rather it is a lightweight version of a deck of cards sitting constantly on your wrist. Once the wristband is safely placed on you, you need to stay within your confined flat ,and never futher than 30 feet away from your phone, from which the wristband wearer's actions are monitored.

Not only did the app pop up an alert to the user, reminding them that they ware being watched, but on the third day of the quarantine, a government official called the person to chek that they were at home, and on the 10th day two uniformed officers knocked on their door asking for the I.D. to prove they were still at home.

After two weeks, all the person has to do is click the ""Finish the quarantine"" button on the app, and remove the wristband and they're free to roam.

UPDATE May 20, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The WHO Regional Director for the Americas Dr. Carissa F. Etienne stressed that addressing COVID-19 will necessitate the protection of vulnerable groups like women, underprivileged populations, indigenous populations, and migrants by confronting health, social, and economic inequalities exacerbated by the crisis, reports the WHO.

WHO published a new Case Report Form regarding ""Suspected cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) in kids and adolescents temporally related to COVID-19,"" which aims for convenient use by public health officials for collecting standardized data on clinical representations, case severity and observed outcomes.

Uganda has commissioned the first Port Health coronavirus laboratory in the main Uganda-Tanzania border after signs of possible coronavirus importation via truck drivers surfaced. Two GeneXpert machines will see use to test all truck drivers who reach the Mutukula point of entry, where test results will be completed within 45 minutes.

A Cairo doctor described how he became infected with and eventually recovered from the COVID-19 coronavirus, stressing the need for health care workers to practice elementary infection, prevention, and control measures while working with patients.

UPDATE May 19, 8:31 AM EDT: President Donald Trump has been taking unproven coronavirus drug, even without showing any symptoms

On Monday, President Trump stated that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug not yet proven to be a full treatment against COVID-19. Apparently Trump has been taking the drug in the form a daily pill for a week and a half now, even though he shows no signs of having the virus.

Only last month the FDA cautioned against taking hydroxychloroquine ""outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.""

Hydroxychloroquine may have adverse side effects, but Trump said that ""And it seems to have an impact — and maybe it does, maybe it doesn't — but if it doesn't, you're not going to get sick or die. This is a, a pill that's been used for a long time for 30, 40 years on the malaria and or lupus to, and even on arthritis I guess from what I understand, so it's been heavily tested,"" he said.

""What do you have to lose?"" he added, explaining that he is taking the drug as a ""preventative"" measure.

UPDATE May 19, 08:19 AM EDT: CDC launching U.S.-wide coronavirus antibody study for 325,000 residents in 25 cities

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is planning a nationwide coronavirus antibody study of 325,000 people across 25 metropolitan areas, including Boston, New York, and Minneapolis. testing will start this summer and carry out until next year, as per Reuters' report.

The study will test blood samples of donors from these 25 cities for antibodies present when the immune system fights off the virus, as per Dr. Michael Busch director of the nonprofit Vitalant Research Institute. Busch is also leading the preliminary study of the blood samples, and will be testing 36,000 samples.

The hope is to better understand the coronavirus' impact on the human body in order to find an appropriate treatment, cure, or vaccine. The CDC's study will test 1,000 blood samples in each of the 25 cities per month over a 12 month period. Then, testing will ramp up to 25,000 donors from the 18th month onwards. The blood samples will come fro ""regular, altruistic donors"" who donate blood as per Busch.

UPDATE May 19, 08:07 AM EDT: Germany and France join forces to propose 500 billion euro fund to help the E.U. recover amid the outbreak

In order to help the E.U.'s countries to recover more quickly from the coronavirus outbreak, Germany and France have proposed a 500 billion euro (over $540 billion) fund. This amount would add to the already-agreed-upon half-trillion dollars the E.U. bloc signed off on last month.

Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron disclosed the news at a press conference on Monday, with President Macron live via video conference. The funds would be raised through E.U.-backed bonds and would be put to use in the hardest hit regions and industries. Moreover, it would be offered in terms of grants and not loans, with repayments coming from the E.U. budget over the next 20 years or so.

Chancellor Merkel called for solidarity between the 27 nation-bloc, stating that the current economic challenge ""requires this unusual, one-off effort that Germany and France are now prepared to take.""

As per Chancellor Merkel's statement ""The goal is for Europe to emerge from the crisis stronger.""

UPDATE May 19, 8:00 AM EDT: Seychelles bans cruise ships from entering its port through 2021

Part of the measures to minimize the impact of COVID-19 in the country, the Seychelles has decided to ban all cruise ships from entering Port Victoria until after 2021. The Minister for Tourism, Civil Aviation, Ports and Marine Didier Dogley stated that the ban goes into effect immediately and carries out until the end of 2021, as per local newspaper the Nation.

Minister Dogley also stated that the government has taken measures to ensure tourism-related companies stay afloat during the outbreak, or at least until the industry picks up again. On top of salary guarantee until June, other available support include soft loans, and tax holiday — a government program that offers a tax reduction or elimination to businesses.

UPDATE May 19, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros said to the World Health Assembly: ""We have come together as the nations of the world to confront the defining health crisis of our time,"" reports the WHO. As he concluded he remarked that the COVID-19 outbreak is a reminder that the world needs a safer, healthier, and fairer standard of health, and a stronger WHO will support this goal.

Around the world, countries have placed a spectrum of public health and social measures to slow or halt community spread of the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO published a document to give an overview of social measures and public health, and to offer strategies to limit potential harm resulting from these interventions.

A new WHO report on the health behaviors of children aged 11 to 15 in Europe shows that more adolescents have reported mental health concerns. The results were founded on data collected from 2014 to 2019 and give a baseline against which forthcoming studies might measure the impact of the outbreak on young people's lives.

The WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific just released a new timeline highlighting key moments and actions taken in response to the spread of COVID-19 in their respective region.

UPDATE May 18, 11:13 AM EDT: Just days after reopening, 70 new coronavirus cases linked to schools have been reported in France

One week after a third of kids in France returned to school, a flare-up of 70 new coronavirus cases linked to the schools have already been reported.

Some schools reopened last week, and another 150,000 junior high-school students returned to school this Monday in France. The move was initially welcomed, however French Education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, warned of the worrying numbers and the 70 schools that reported these new cases were immediately shut down again.

There was no specification as to whether the new cases were reported in schoolchildren or teachers. Blanquer noted that as the incubation period for the virus is several days, it's likely the infected persons already had the virus prior to schools reopening.

France reopened 40,000 schools last week, with classes capped at 15 students.

UPDATE May 18, 11:04 AM EDT: Europe reopened up widely on Monday

Monday saw an extensive reopening of large parts of Europe as numbers of infections have been slowly decreasing on the continent. Museums, golf coures, cafes, restaurants, shops, have all been slowly reopening their doors across Europe.

The countries are now looking at easing border restrictions as of next month, to try and see what can be done for the Summer tourist season within Europe's countries.

Germany's foreign minister, Heiko Maas, was in talks with 10 Southern European nations, and told ZDF Television ""This vacation this year won’t be like the ones we know from the past. The pandemic is still there, and we must at least have safety precautions for the worst case that the figures get worse again.""

UPDATE May 18, 10:58 AM EDT: Moderna's vaccine results are promising

On Monday, biotech Moderna, released the first human trial results from early coronavirus vaccine, called mRNA-1273. A small number of volunteers from the trial showed immune responses that may help protect people from becoming infected with the coronavirus.

Moderna plans on moving forward rapidly with its next phase of testing, with the hope of having an emergency vaccine ready by Autumn.

UPDATE May 18, 10:41 AM EDT: FDA authorizes at-home COVID-19 sample collection kit

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized an at-home sample collection kit that can be sent across to specified laboratories for COVID-19 diagnostics testing.

The sample is made by Everlywell, Inc., and is called the Everlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit, which has received FDA emergency authorization for use. Those wishing to receive the at-home test must first undergo an online questionnaire that is then reviewed by a health care provider. The user will then be able to self-collect a nasal sample through Everylywell's testing kit.

The FDA has also authorized two diagnostics tests for COVID-19, which are to be performed at specific laboratories. ""The authorization of a COVID-19 at-home collection kit that can be used with multiple tests at multiple labs not only provides increased patient access to tests, but also protects others from potential exposure,"" said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

""Today’s action is also another great example of public-private partnerships in which data from a privately funded study was used by industry to support an EUA request, saving precious time as we continue our fight against this pandemic.”

UPDATE May 18, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The ""73rd World Health Assembly"" opened today and will focus on the COVID-19 outbreak, reports the WHO. Member States will give statements and report their progress in fighting the coronavirus, in addition to sharing knowledge on the changing situation and considering a draft resolution on the COVID-19 crisis. The document is available online in Arabic, Russian, French, Chinese, English, and Spanish.

The WHO signed a new agreement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to join forces and promote health through physical and sports activities. The new agreement is especially focused on preventing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This new collaboration is apt because of the way the COVID-19 outbreak is at present affecting people with NCDs, claims the WHO.

Floods in Somalia have raised concerns regarding an upsurge in cholera cases as the ravaged country works to confront the growing number of coronavirus cases. The WHO's country office has since sent sorely-needed essential medical supplies, despite very low funding available for humanitarian operations in Somalia.

Sony Music Latin and Global Citizen just released a new ""Color Esperanza"" track, with proceeds going to benefit the Pan American Health Organization (PAGO) the WHO's Regional Office for the Americas, and its COVID-19 relief projects active throughout the Americas.

UPDATE May 17, 11:30 AM EDT: COVID-19 also affects the toes, say dermatologists

COVID-19 may show symptoms on the skin and particularly on the skin of toes, reported AP. The revelation is a rather unusual one

Massachusetts General Hospital dermatologist Esther Freeman told AP she expected to see skin ailments surfacing from the virus. “But I was not anticipating those would be toes,” explained Freeman.

Now, people are calling them “COVID toes.” They look like what doctors would see on the feet and hands of people who’ve spent a long time outdoors in the cold: red and on occasion itchy.

However, the American Academy of Dermatology is not advising that people race to the emergency room if toes are the only symptom. Instead, a telemedicine check is preferred as the first step for people wondering if they do indeed have “COVID toes.” Doctors can then make a better informed decision about what the symptoms really are.

UPDATE May 17, 8:30 AM EDT: Anti-lockdown protests take place in Warsaw, London

Protests took place Saturday in European cities against lockdown restrictions, reported AP. The demonstrations resulted in tear gas used in Poland and arrests made in London.

In German cities, police enforced distancing rules as many gathered to express their anger at restrictions that are affecting the economy and resulting in a loss of civic freedom.

In Stuttgart, the permitted number of 5,000 demonstrators was exceeded and police directed people to another open space. A mask requirement was also implemented under threat of a 300 euro ($325) fine.

UPDATE May 17, 8:00 AM EDT: Coronavirus spreading across Russia

After devastating Moscow, the coronavirus is now spreading across Russia’s 11 time zones, reported CNN.

The country's coronavirus headquarters confirmed on Sunday that out of Russia's total of 281,752 cases, 142,824 are in Moscow. The virus, however, is now also spreading to other regions in the country, regions that are unfortunately too impoverished to handle its coming well.

President Vladimir Putin said in a video conference meeting with the country’s 85 leaders that it would fall to local leadership to decide whether to continue lockdown measures.

""We have a big country,"" he said. ""The epidemiological situation varies across the regions. We factored this in before, and now at the next stage, we have to act even more specifically and carefully.""

Russia's regions have now begun reporting their own coronavirus numbers. This has resulted in an occasional disparity between the nationally published statistics and local government numbers.

UPDATE May 16, 4:00 PM EDT: Navy confirms eight more USS Theodore Roosevelt sailors have coronavirus for a second time

Sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt are not faring well as the Navy confirmed on Saturday that eight more have tested positive again for the coronavirus, reported AP. This raises the number of sailors who have become infected a second time to 13.

The sailors had already gone through at least two weeks of isolation and had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two, to return to duty. But this did not stop them from getting infected once more.

The incident brings to question the accuracy of testing. There is the chance that in some cases infection can be at such a low level that it is not detected by the test. In that case, the eight incidents do not constitute a relapse.

UPDATE May 15, 5:00 PM EDT: Successful 'real-time' modeling of Germany's COVID-19 outbreak might help other countries

A new report in Science shows how meticulous modeling throughout the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany has provided critical intelligence that might help other countries contain the spread of the disease.

Precision in forecast models for the short-term future of the COVID-19 outbreak allowed decision-makers the crucial intelligence needed to contain and mitigate the effects of the disease on a societal scale.

However, the many data points shift as public interventions — like social distancing — begin to take effect in the area. The new study in Science demonstrates how observed changes in the coronavirus' growth rate matched well with public declarations of intervention measures in Germany.

The three main pillars of modeling an outbreak consist of establishing central epidemiological parameters like the virus' reproduction number, the mass effort to simulate the real-world effects of various comparative ""battle plans"" to minimize the outbreak collateral, and estimation of real-world effects such measures might have — which will allow for rapid adjustments to the model, with the aim of adapting short-term projections.

The data show that magnitude and timing are key when it comes to COVID-19 interventions. Called ""change points,"" the moments when the real-world effects necessitate an adaptation of outbreak modeling to account for changes in the disease's progression caused by interventional steps. And, according to the study, models with two or three change points showed optimal predictive efficacy.

UPDATE May 15, 7:19 A EDT: Moscow residents receive free coronavirus tests

All residents of Moscow, in Russia, have started receiving free COVID-19 antibody tests from 30 clinics throughout the city as of Friday. The program was announced by the city's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, who explained it'll allow officials ""to know precisely how many Muscovites had coronavirus and developed immunity, how many people are infected or are suspected to have coronavirus.""

Sobyanin said that up to 200,000 tests a day by the end of the month would be carried out, and that 70,000 residents will start receiving invitations for testing ""every few days"". The results will help the city coordinate the work of health care facilities, and what decisions to make regarding easing lockdown restrictions.

The city's 12 million-strong residents count for half of the country's 262,000 confirmed cases.

UPDATE May 15, 07:08 AM EDT: Research looking into whether or not non-thermal plasma could inactivate coronavirus

Associate Professor, Herek Clack, of the University of Michigan has been looking into whether or not non-thermal plasma can inactivate airborne viruses. On top of this, another one of Clack's studies proved that non-thermal plasma could inactivate porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus. Now, scientists are gathering around Clack and his work to see whether or not non-thermal plasma can inactivate SARS-COV-2, the novel coronavirus.

Clack explains the precise mechanism by which the plasma deactivates these viruses is still being explored. ""But the thinking is that it interrupts the ability for the virus to dock with its host cell,"" he says. ""Our studies show that the number of infectious virus dropped more than two log, so more than 99 percent, if you compare before and after plasma treatment.""

It would take a fair bit of clearance and funding before Clack and his team could start observing and working with the coronavirus, as he explains ""COVID-19 is… highly contagious, with no innate population immunity, potentially deadly health outcomes, and no vaccine in sight—so gaining approval to work with it is not a mundane undertaking.""

There are a number of other research proposals already in the long queue, but there could be a good chance that non-thermal plasma may indeed block out the novel coronavirus from latching on to host cells.

UPDATE May 15, 07:01 AM EDT: Abbott Laboratories' COVID-19 test may be inaccurate, as per FDA

On Thursday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert following a New York University (NYU) study that stated Abbott's rapid diagnostic coronavirus test kit was offering inaccurate readings.

The ID NOW test is specifically giving false reports of negative results. Those who receive a negative test result are being urged to follow up with another test, with another company's test kit. The kit is still giving out accurate positive results.

The FDA is keeping a close eye on the matter ""We are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue,"" said Tim Stenzel, director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health at the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, in a statement. ""We will continue to study the data available and are working with the company to create additional mechanisms for studying the test.""

Abbott refutes the study as it explained ""While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport, and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run,"" Abbott said in a statement on Thursday. ""ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.""

UPDATE May 15, 6:46 AM EDT: Cannabis may help block out COVID-19, as per study

A study by scientists at the University of Lethbridge in Canada has demonstrated that cannabis may block COVID-19 infection from happening. The researchers studied over 400 strains of cannabis, honing down on a dozen or so that may show potential in blocking out COVID-19.

Lead researcher of the study, Dr. Igor Kovalchuk, explained to the National Post that certain strains showed promising results as they offered less fertile ground for the virus to take root. Moreover, Dr. Kovalchuk said that ""A number of them have reduced the number of these (virus) receptors by 73 per cent, the chance of it getting in is much lower."" Reducing the number of receptors minimizes the chances of infection.

This is not to say that everyone should take up smoking pot in order not to catch COVID-19 (not yet anyways). The study's results have yet to be peer-reviewed and evidence that cannabis can help treat the virus is inconclusive at this stage. Once more research has been carried out, and if cannabis can indeed work to help keep COVID-19 at bay, Dr. Kovalchuk suspects it would be taken in the form of a mouth watch, gargle, inhalants or gell caps.

UPDATE May 15, 4:32 AM EDT: China has 5 potential vaccine candidates in human trials, with more on the way

China has five potential vaccines for the coronavirus in the human trial stage, with more set for approval next month, signaling the country's rapid progress in the global race to find a viable vaccine to immunize their respective populations, reports Bloomberg.

The five vaccines have so far been tested on more than 2,000 people, and are in phase II trials — expected to be completed in July, said Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission, during a Beijing press briefing on Friday, reports Bloomberg. Phase II is the second of three human trial phases that every potential vaccine must undergo before granted approval for widespread use.

As of writing, there have been no serious side effects reported among phase II patients, added Zeng, who explained that additional candidates will receive approval for human trials in June of this year.

UPDATE May 15, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization Regional Director for South_east Asia, Dr. Poonam Khetrapal Singh stressed for countries in the region to ease public health and social ""lockdown"" measures in a step-wise manner, adding that local epidemiology should guide collective action in forming a ""new normal"" in the post-coronavirus world, reports the WHO.

The WHO's Regional Director for Europe Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge urged his constituent region to take heed that ""our behavior today, will set the course for the pandemic,"" and stressed how behavioral insights gained amid the outbreak are valuable in the design and implementation of apt pandemic response measures.

A U.N. COVID-19 and mental health policy brief warned that substantial investment is required to avoid a mental health crisis. Reports have indicated an increase in general symptoms of depression and anxiety in several countries.

UPDATE May 14, 4:00 PM EDT: Microsoft, Adaptive jointly launch new study on human immune system versus coronavirus

Microsoft and a biotech firm called Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp. are jointly launching a new study to examine how the immune system fights COVID-19, with plans to collect blood samples door-to-door, according to a Microsoft press release.

The goal of the joint venture is to learn how T cells — the expendable yet crucial pawns of our immune systems — help the body adequately respond to the coronavirus.

Other scientists have already investigated the body's immune response to COVID-19, but a Business Insider report says Adaptive and Microsoft perceive an epistemic blindspot in the study of T cells amid other concurrent coronavirus studies.

To fill the gap in knowledge about how the body combats coronavirus infection, Adaptive and Microsoft are reportedly prepping to send phlebotomists to homes of those who were previously exposed to the virus, those who are already sick, and the lucky survivors of infection — for a sample of their blood.

UPDATE May 14, 7:32 AM EDT: Contactless infrared sensors that measure temperature screen people before they enter buildings

Engineers from Portugal's University of Porto have developed a contactless outdoor temperature check, so as to ensure people entering any building are not infected with COVID-19. This will be useful in schools, universities, airports, stores, office buildings and more.

The screening station has a medical-grade infrared temperature sensor and ultrasonic distance sensors that are held up by two 3D-printed metal rods stuck to a 3D-printed base.

The system is simple enough to use: a person stands in front of the station, the ultrasonic distance sensors detect when a person is present and the temperature sensor reads their body temperature to see if they are feverish.

The device can be mounted onto a wall outside any building or public space, markings are set out in front so that a person knows where to stand, which is about 20 cm away. If the reading is high, the system alerts the person to get a COVID-19 test. From start to finish, the entire process takes 20 seconds.

The system is still in its prototype phase, with testing to follow.

UPDATE May 14, 7:20 AM EDT: Google and Apple working together to launch COVID-19 digital contact tracing development

This month, Google and Apple have jointly shared specifications for software developers to built contact tracing apps for both Google and Apple mobile operating systems.

Digital contact tracing lets a user know whether or not they've crossed paths with a coronavirus-infected person. As this trend grows the question of whether or not governments will opt for these apps arises, as well as how well they would work.

The two companies are being advised in part by the MIT-led Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT) project, which hopes to automate contact tracing, and has a large focus on privacy. ""Our job is to make sure what [Apple and Google] implement is as private as possible,"" said Marc Zissman, co-PI on the PACT team and associate head of the Cyber Security and Information Sciences Division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. ""We’re very optimistic about the whole thing, but we still have to prove it,' he continued.

As the teams work on the project, they're sharing all information and data publicly.

UPDATE May 14, 7:13 AM EDT: AI is getting confused because of unpredictable pandemic shopping

MIT Tech Review reported that Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms were becoming more and more confused as online searches and purchases have become less and less predictable during the outbreak.

For instance, Amazon's top searches during regular times involved phone cases, chargers, or Lego. Since February, their top contenders have switched to hand sanitizier, N95 masks, Clorox wipes, and toilet paper — COVID-19 staples, but not machine learning systems' ones.

Humans are now having to realign AI algorithms more regularly by hand so as to ensure they can keep up with the disarray and unpredictability of us humans during these times. For instance, a company that detects credit card fraud has had to change its algorithms to take into account more interest in gardening equipment and power tools.

However, many companies are using this opportunity to improve their AI, so it's not just confusion.

UPDATE May 14, 7:05 AM EDT: France protests against U.S. getting Sanofi vaccine first, and world leaders release an open letter for a people's vaccine

Bloomberg reported that a French government minister called the instance where the U.S. gets first dibs on a Sanofi coronavirus vaccine ""unacceptable."" However, it is the U.S. that has been funding the French company's research.

These comments bring to light an arising issue with regards to a vaccine: which countries will get their hands on the first batch? In light of this, 140 world leaders have released an open letter calling for a ""people's vaccine"" to be available for free to everyone.

“Nobody should be pushed to the back of the vaccine queue because of where they live or what they earn,” said South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa.

In the meantime, it's still undecided whether or not the U.S. will be the first to get its hands on the Sanofi vaccine.

UPDATE May 14, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization published a stop-gap document on Laboratory biosafety for use in testing clinical specimens of patients that meet the case definition of the COVID-19 illness, reports the WHO.

During his media briefing yesterday, Director-General of WHO Dr. Tedros stressed the urgent need for all countries to invest in strong health systems and primary healthcare as the strongest defense against world-historical outbreaks like COVID-19. The World Health Statistics published by the WHO depict the facts: people worldwide live longer and healthier lives with significant gains in low-income countries. The WHO report also suggests the rate of progress is too slow to match Sustainable Development Goals and will be even more behind schedule as a result of COVID-19.

WHO declared the launch of the WHO Academy and the WHO info mobile applications on Thursday. The WHO Academy app is designed to support health workers throughout the COVID-19 crisis while the WHO Info app will help the general public with real-time mobile access to the latest crucial news and critical developments.

Overcrowding in many detention centers undermines health, hygiene, safety, and human dignity, so UNODC, WHO, UNAIDS, and OHCHR have released a joint statement on COVID-19 in prisons and similarly-closed locations to emphasize the need for political leaders to understand the heightened vulnerability of prisoners and others deprived of personal liberty amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

UPDATE May 13, 4:00 PM EDT: Harvard and MIT researchers are developing coronavirus detecting masks that light up to signal

A team of scientists at MIT and Harvard is adapting a Zika- and Ebola-detecting face mask tool capable of detecting coronavirus cases, according to a post on Harvard University's Wyss Institute page, reports Interesting Engineering.

Initially used for other diseases with research published in the journal Cell, now the team is adapting the tool to emit fluorescent signals when a person infected with the coronavirus breathes, coughs, or sneezes. If it works, this might help close the gap in effective testing left open by other screening methods, like temperature checks.

""As we open up our transit system, you could envision it being used in airports as we go through security, as we wait to get on a plane,"" said researcher Jim Collins to Business Insider. ""You or I could use it on the way to and from work. Hospitals could use it for patients as they come in or wait in the waiting room as a pre-screen of who's infected.""

There is a possibility that this technology could be used to do on-site diagnoses of patients — without forcing them to wait for samples to be sent to a laboratory. Testing errors and delays have slowed several countries' attempts to contain local coronavirus outbreaks, so this tool might turn out to be a crucial addition to the anti-COVID-19 arsenal.

UPDATE May 13, 6:00 PM EDT: California man had only 1% survival rate for COVID-19, but walked free after two-month stay in hospital

Gregg Garfield is a California man who survived a 64-day stay in the hospital from a severe COVID-19 case, 31 of which were spent under a ventilator, and on Friday he beat the bad 1%-odds and left the hospital, according to a post on the hospital's Facebook page.

At 54 years old, Garfield was the ""patient zero"" of Providence St. Joseph Medical Center — in Burbank, California — roughly 10 miles north of Los Angeles, reports USA Today.

The man fell ill with COVID-19 and was later hospitalized after a February trip to the northern part of Italy — infamous for its coronavirus toll — with a dozen friends.

""The disease kicked off, and my immune system just ate me alive,"" said the man to a local Los Angeles news source. An accomplished and athletic skier, Garfield almost lost the long fight against the disease.

UPDATE May 13, 7:17 AM EDT: Gilead signs licensing pact with drugmakers to supply experimental COVID-19 treatment

Gilead Sciences Inc. announced on Tuesday that it has signed a non-exclusive licensing pact with five generic drugmakers based in Pakistan and India to expand its supply of an experimental treatment for COVID-19, remdesivir.

The pact enables the companies, Jubilant Life Scienes Ltd., Cipla Ltd., Hetero Labs Ltd., Mylan NV, and Ferozsons Laboratories Ltd. to make and sell the drug in 127 countries worldwide. These countries represent almost all low- to middle-income ones, with a few middle- to upper-income countries.

The pact also enables the licensees to select their own price tags for the drug, as per Gilead. The company's drug received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) emergency approval this month to treat COVID-19 patients.

So far, there is no other approved drug to treat COVID-19, and remdesivir has received more and more interest.

UPDATE May 13, 7:05 AM EDT: Mexico will re-open construction, mining, and car and truck manufacturing

Mexico's top advisory body for the coronavirus pandemic confirmed on Tuesday that the country will re-open its mining, construction, and car and truck manufacturing.

These industries have been classified as ""essential activities"" by the General Health Council and so are allowed to resume work even during the lockdown. The Council has yet to disclose a start date for these activities, but it mentioned that by June 1, the country would have a ""stoplight"" system that explains which activities will be allowed for the local population.

The council also mentioned that restrictions on schools and businesses should be lifted from townships with no COVID-19 cases, that also have neighboring townships free of COVID-19 cases.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador will announce on Wednesday the country's gradual resumption of economic activities.

So far, Mexico has over 38,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and nearly 4,000 deaths.

UPDATE May 13, 6:59 AM EDT: Argument over the reopening of Tesla's factory in California may have come to a close

It's looking likely that the dispute between Tesla and the San Francisco Bay Area authorities over reopening the automaker's Fremont factory after shutdown may be ending.

Early on Wednesday, the Alameda County Public Health Department announced on Twitter that the factory could go beyond basic operations this week and resume making cars on Monday — so long as the safety measures for workers are agreed upon.

Fremont police has yet to verify whether Tesla will hold up its part of the agreement. Tesla reopened its factory on Monday, in defiance of county orders and it's yet to be disclosed whether or not the company will face any charges.

UPDATE May 13, 6:54 AM EDT: Tech company engineers drones to deliver medical supplies in Ghana and Rwanda

Tech company, Zipline, has engineered autonomous drones to carry critical COVID-19 supplies to rural health centers and hospitals in Ghana and Rwanda. The drones can deliver the supplies between 15 and 30 minutes from the moment of delivery. Doctors simply input their requests or orders via Zipline's app, and the drones can deploy within seven minutes. They can fly in any type of weather condition and have a 300 kilometer round-trip range.

So far, both African countries have not been badly hit by the outbreak's impact, and Zipline is still able to keep up with demand. Ghana has reported around 4,700 cases and 22 deaths, and Rwanda has confirmed 284 cases and no deaths so far.

UPDATE May 13, 6:30 AM EDT: No new coronavirus cases in New Zealand for second day in a row

There were no new cases of the COVID-19 illness reported in New Zealand on Wednesday, marking the second day running, according to the Health Ministry, reports RNZ.

The sum of confirmed and probable coronavirus cases remains at 1,497, of which 1,147 were confirmed as of writing. Dr. Ashley Bloomfield — Director-General of Health — said 1,402 people have recovered in the country, up 12 from yesterday, with 94% of all cases in New Zealand now recovered, RNZ reports.

There are only two people currently receiving hospital care in the country, neither of whom are in ICU.

Bloomfield added that 5,961 were tested for infection yesterday, with more than 200,000 carried out to date.

""This milestone of 200,000 tests, which is just over 4 percent of the population, is a significant achievement. I want to recognize everybody who has been tested, as well as the many, many people across the system who have facilitated that happening, it is an incredibly important pillar of our response to COVID-19.""

He also said that Wednesday's figures supported the consensus that New Zealand is ""on the right path.""

""We can't afford to give away the progress we've made. We do need to remain vigilant.""

UPDATE May 13, 4:00 AM: WHO situational report

The World Health Organization published a new addendum to the guidance regarding considerations on adjusting public health and social measures (PHSM), reports the WHO. It provides practical decision process measures to assist countries through their PHSM adaptation process based on epidemiological and public health criteria.

The 2020 World Health Statistics that WHO published on Wednesday show that the COVID-19 outbreak is creating a significant loss of lice, disrupting livelihoods, and threatens recent advances in health and progress toward development in sustainability, and pre-established goals.

WHO joined efforts with the United Kingdom to carry out an awareness campaign called ""Stop The Spread"" regarding the risks attached to spreading inaccurate and false information on the outbreak.

WHO's Regional Director for the Americas Dr. Carissa F. Etienne announced that countries should ""support their economies while building strong social protection networks and embracing evidence-based public health measures that are essential to saving lives.""

UPDATE May 12, 2:50 PM EDT: US President Trump says California should allow Tesla to reopen despite COVID-19 lockdown

U.S. President Donald Trump argued for the state of California to allow Tesla to reopen its electric vehicle assembly plant in California, in agreement with CEO Elon Musk's defiance of local county officials who ordered the facility to stay closed, according to a tweet from the President.

California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2020

In the tweet, Trump said: ""California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!""

A few hours later, Musk replied to the President with a tweet of his own, saying ""Thank you!""

Thank you! — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2020

This comes on the heels of Musk's Twitter defiance of Alameda County, where he announced Tesla's production would resume despite orders to stay closed from local officials. He also said that if anyone should be arrested, it should be him.

Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020

UPDATE May 12, 1:53 PM EDT: Twitter declares staff may continue working from home permanently

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sent an email to Twitter staff Tuesday informing employees that they may continue working from home on a permanent basis, reports TechCrunch. The CEO said Twitter was an early adopter of the work-from-home model, but added that the push was accelerated by COVID-19 orders to stay home.

In the email, Twitter confirmed the decision to TechCrunch, saying:

""We were uniquely positioned to respond quickly and allow folks to work from home given our emphasis on decentralization and supporting a distributed workforce capable of working from anywhere. The past few months have proven we can make that work. So if our employees are in a role and situation that enables them to work from home and they want to continue to do so forever, we will make that happen. If not, our offices will be their warm and welcoming selves, with some additional precautions, when we feel it's safe to return.""

The company is also working on new plans to resume in-person working arrangements and meetings for workers who prefer an office experience. San Francisco Mayor London Breed declared on April 27 that the city will extend its stay at home orders throughout the end of May, Governor Gavin Newsom has already spoken of easing some restrictions.

Twitter's guidelines as stipulated by Chief HR Officer Jennifer Christie are as follows: ""Opening offices will be our decision, when and if our employees come back, will be theirs. With very few exceptions, offices won't open before September. When we do decide to open offices, it also won't be a snap back to the way it was before. It will be careful, intentional, office by office and gradual. There will also be no business travel before September, with very few exceptions, and no in-person company events for the rest of 2020. We will assess 2021 events later this year.""

While these guidelines could change, Twitter is more likely to push its timeline back, from the tone of the guidelines. Other major Silicon Valley tech firms like Google and Facebook have extended their work-from-home policies through the end of 2020.

UPDATE May 12, 12:21 PM EDT: Wuhan set to test all 11 million residents after six new cases of the COVID-19 illness were reported

China plans to implement a major new testing regime in Wuhan following the report of new coronavirus cases in the city for the first time since April 3, reports BuzzFeed. The six new cases were confirmed in the same housing complex on Sunday and Monday, and — according to state media — all cases were contracted via transmission from within the country.

The new cases raise troubling questions on whether the virus was eradicated in Wuhan, where it emerged last December, and residents struggled through a 76 — day lockdown.

The government has requested all districts of Wuhan — where roughly 11 million people live, roughly the same population as Ohio -- to develop plans to test all of their residents in just 10 days using nucleic acid testing, according to reports from state media.

In contrast, the U.S. has been effecting roughly 300,000 tests per day.

This comes amid global scrutiny on whether China is or has obscured the true extent of the pandemic during its first weeks and regarding the accuracy of official data currently published on new infections.

All new cases in Wuhan were categorized as asymptomatic.

UPDATE May 12, 7:51 AM EDT: Toyota reports sharp plunge in profit at virus outbreak, but foresees recovery

On Tuesday, Toyota Motor Corp. reported a steep fall in fiscal fourth quarter profit due to the COVID-19 pandemic halting vehicle sales and production.

Japan's top-ranking automaker reported a net profit of 63.1 billion yen, ($590 million) for the quarter that ended in March, which is a steep 86% fall from 459.5 billion yen during the same period the year before.

President Akio Toyoda mentioned this was the company's biggest crisis since the global financial crisis, but he said Toyota is learning to grow leaner and to make a fresh start.

The company's officials stated it was hard to foresee what the future of the company held as the lockdowns around the world range in severity and major uncertainties linked to the outbreak could still emerge. But, sales are expected to recover once the pandemic is brought under control.

UPDATE May 12, 7:42 AM EDT: Greece back in recession, moves to digital services for move more quickly out of it

To try and minimize its pandemic-related recession, Greece plans to expand its government digital services. Over 500 services are now available via a new online portal: gov.gr, which started running on March 21, during the country's lockdown.

Kyriakos Pierrakakis, minister of digital governance, told the Associated Press that the aim is to add 200 more services before the end of the year, that's about one per day. These services range from applying for medical prescriptions online, to filing architectural designs.

Greece had barely moved out of its recession, and now it's expected to suffer the worse recession in the E.U. this year due to COVID-19, as its tourism sector, and others, have been hugely hit. The European nation is hoping that moving more towards technology will help make life easier and move out of the recession more quickly.

UPDATE May 12, 7:36 AM EDT: Expert explains that many countries are walking in the dark are lockdowns ease

Many countries are easing their lockdowns after weeks and sometimes months of restrictions, however, questions arise as to how well prepared some countries are as their lockdowns end.

The WHO's emergencies chief, Dr. Michael Ryan, mentioned that Germany and South Korea's solid contact tracing measures would hopefully help the countries to detect and stop the spread of the virus before they get out of control. However, other nations have not used such strong contact tracing investigators so as to contact people who have tested positive.

""Shutting your eyes and trying to drive through this blind is about as silly an equation as I’ve seen,"" Ryan said. ""And I’m really concerned that certain countries are setting themselves up for some seriously blind driving over the next few months.""

UPDATE May 12, 7:28 AM EDT: Ventilator that short-circuited in a Russian hospital killed five coronavirus patients in ICU

Russian news agencies reported that a short-circuit in a ventilator in the St Petersburg St George Hospital started a blaze that killed five coronavirus patients in intensive care units (ICU).

The fire was put out rapidly and 150 patients were evacuated from the hospital, as per the country's emergency ministry. No exact numbers of injured have been disclosed, and Russia's NTV news website reported that the fire was contained in one small COVID-19 ward on the sixth floor.

""The ventilators are working to their limits. Preliminary indications are that it was overloaded and caught fire, and that was the cause,"" a source at St Petersburg emergencies department explained to the Interfax news agency.

So far, St Petersburg, which has a population of 4.9 million, has reported just over 8,000 coronavirus cases so far, and has 5,483 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients.

UPDATE MAY 12, 7:17 AM EDT: Finnish team develops vaccine that's nearly ready for testing, and is open-source

Finnish researchers have a vaccine that could start tests in only six weeks, however, the team is worried that once the vaccine is effective commercially, they'll end up at the back of the queue, along with other smaller nations.

""I see it as a significant risk that we won't get vaccine in time and in the quantities needed, rather we'll find ourselves at the end of queue,"" said Helsinki University Professor of Virology Kalle Saksela, who is part of the team of three working on the vaccine. The other two are Seppo Ylä-Herttuala and Kari Alitalo from the University of Eastern Finland.

Saksela believes its important that Finland should have control of its own vaccine production, and not to completely depend on the large pharmaceuticals. It would be possible, as Finland has research and development companies that could adapt themselves to manufacturing vaccines.

The team working on the vaccine are choosing to forego the intellectual property rights to their work. Their vaccine has come from them gathering data in the field, refining it, adding their own observations, and making it freely available. As such, they are hoping to pass the expensive and time-consuming part, which is human testing. Saksela admits this is a risky move, but as their work is developed from existing and tested data, it should in principle be safe.

UPDATE May 12, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization has published novel guidance on Considerations for school-related public health measures in the context of the coronavirus outbreak as an addendum on earlier guidance regarding adjusting public health and social measures published mid-April, reports the WHO.

WHO also issued a Statement on Tobacco use and COVID-19. Smoking of tobacco is known to increase risk contracting many respiratory infections and also increases the severity of respiratory diseases. WHO convened a review of studies carried out by public health experts, which found smokers to be more likely to develop the severe version of respiratory diseases after contracting the coronaviras, compared to non-smokers. WHO urges scientists, researchers, and the media to be cautious in potentially amplifying unproven claims that nicotine or tobacco might reduce the risk of COVID-19.

In his media briefing, the Director-General Dr. Tedros urged for a slow-and-steady lifting of public health and social measures, which is key to stimulating stymied economies, while also keeping vigilant attention on the virus so control measures may be quickly reimplemented should another upswing of cases occur.

UPDATE May 11, 4:36 PM EDT: 'If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,' said Elon Musk after reopening Tesla plant despite COVID-19 Lockdown

Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted on Monday to confirm the reopening of his company's Fremont, California facility over the weekend despite an ongoing legal battle with local officials on whether the automaker plant should stay closed amid the coronavirus outbreak and asked to take personal responsibility for legal gray areas. Tesla called back a number of workers and has constructed roughly 200 new Model Y and Model 3 cars, according to two employees who spoke anonymously to The Verge.

This happened while Musk said he may move the company's operations out of the state amid a lawsuit filed on Alameda County regarding its stay-at-home injunction.

Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2020

Musk confirmed the reopening of his Calif. plant in a recent tweet, which said: ""Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules. I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.""

Tesla reportedly called back employees previously placed on furlough last month, according to emails seen by The Verge staff. The automaker previously had only told a few workers to report back to work this week, as Business Insider reported.

Frankly, this is the final straw. Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependen on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 9, 2020

This comes on the heels of logistical threats from Musk on Twitter that he saw Tesla and its relationship to Calif. in a ""final straw"" moment, adding in his May 9 tweet that Tesla ""will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately.""

UPDATE May 11, 12:00 PM EDT: Scientists working to unlock mystery of airborne fluid droplets, transmission of COVID-19

More than 100 years have passed since 50 million people died from the Spanish flu and yet the motion of expelled fluid droplets that carry infectious diseases has gone unsolved, but scientists are now working on the flow physics of respiratory diseases — and believe it could be crucial to containing the coronavirus, according to a study published in Cambridge University's Journal of Fluid Mechanics.

Basic tips to avoid transmission have been the same for a long time: washing hands with soap and water often to remove germs, keeping a safe distance from others, and covering one's mouth and nose with a bandana or face mask.

But now, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Whiting School of Engineering with emphasis on computational fluid dynamics believes more research into how fluid droplets work in the context of COVID-19 will be critical to the fight against the coronavirus.

""I started wondering if there's any data out there about the aerodynamics of these masks to quantify what they are really doing,"" said Mittal. ""As I started to dive into the literature, it became clear that fluid dynamics intersects with nearly every aspect of this pandemic. How droplets are formed and carried, how they infect others, the ventilators we use to treat patients with this disease, even preventative measures like face masks — many of these problems are ultimately related to fluid flow.""

Sneezing can expel thousands of large droplets at a high relative velocity, whereas a cough creates 10 to 100 times fewer potentially-infectious droplets. Speaking alone expels far fewer — roughly 50 per second — and also smaller droplets. These are more likely to remain suspended in the air, travel a farther distance, and effectively transmit the COVID-19 infection once inhaled. Larger droplets are usually left on surfaces — where they contaminate the area and are picked up via tactile contact: with a touch.

UPDATE May 11, 7:08 AM EDT: Scientists looking to use CRISPR gene editing tool to fight COVID-19

Sandia National Lab researchers are genetically engineering antiviral countermeasures to try and fight the coronavirus, as well as any future viral outbreaks or pandemics. CRISPR-based technology and genetic sequencing tools help scientists deeply probe into cells, and now researchers are looking to use these against COVID-19.

The team has been studying emerging infectious diseases for years, such as the Ebola virus and the Nipah one, and has noted that the coronavirus has significant commonalities. So the team is looking to use CRISPR technologies to target a broad spectrum of viruses, and not just one strain.

The team is working on using CRISPR to reprogram cells to block out infection, which would protect the person. The research is still under trial and needs work before being completed, however, it will be a long-term useful technology if and when it's up and running.

UPDATE May 11, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization published new guidance on Surveillance strategies for COVID-19 human infection, reports the WHO. The new document makes an overview of surveillance strategies that Member States should think of as part of comprehensive national surveillance for the COVID-19 crisis. It also stresses the need to adapt and reinforce existing national systems to combat the virus where apt and to scale-up surveillance capacities where necessary.

WHO also published new guidelines on Contact tracing in the context of the coronavirus crisis. When applied systemically, the new guidance will help disrupt the transmission of COVID-19 and other infectious disease and is thus deemed necessary for controlling the outbreaks of infectious disease.

UPDATE May 10, 7:36 AM EDT: Germany to allow cross-border entries for Mother’s Day

Germany’s interior minister is allowing cross-border entries for one day on Mother’s Day in order to permit children who live outside Germany to enter the country to see their mothers, reported AP.

The country’s coronavirus restrictions currently forbid all entries except for exceptional reasons such as work. This would mean that those living across the border could not visit their parents on Mother’s Day.

Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, therefore, made an exception and approved a decision by border police to add filial visits on this special day. The commuters will also be exempt from regulation that forces people entering the country to quarantine for two weeks.

UPDATE May 10, 6:33 AM EDT: Ailment linked to COVID-19 kills three kids in New York

A baffling illness related to COVID-19 has taken the lives of three children in New York and sickened 73 others, reported The New York Times.

“The illness has taken the lives of three young New Yorkers,” Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said during his daily Saturday briefing in Manhattan. “This is new. This is developing.”

The syndrome consists of a toxic-shock-like inflammation that can leave children very ill. It affects the skin, the eyes, blood vessels and the heart.

It has been compared to a rare childhood illness called Kawasaki disease.

Health experts and citizens can no longer take solace in the once-believed notion that COVID-19 largely spared children. Any illusion of that was shattered this week when a 5-year-old in New York City died from the syndrome. The doctors described the case as a “pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.”

“We were laboring under the impression that young people were not affected by COVID-19, and that was actually good news,” Cuomo said. “We still have a lot to learn about this virus.”

The state will now be collaborating with the New York Genome Center and Rockefeller University to determine what is causing the new illness.

UPDATE May 10, 6:33 AM EDT: Wuhan reports first coronavirus case since April 3

Local health officials in Wuhan in China reported on Sunday the city’s first new coronavirus case since a month, reported CNN.

The patient is said to be in a critical condition. Meanwhile, his wife also has the virus but is asymptomatic.

In addition, five new patients from the new case’s community showing no symptoms have been put under observation. It should be noted that China's national and local health commissions do not count asymptomatic cases in their confirmed cases.

Wuhan’s borders were reopened on April 8 after a 76-day lockdown.

UPDATE May 9, 10: 15 AM EDT: South Korea, Germany show new outbreaks just when they were preparing to ease up security measures

Just when it looked like things were getting better, South Korea’s capital closed down more than 2,100 bars on Saturday in response to a new cluster of coronavirus infections, reported AP.

Meanwhile, Germany struggled to contain fresh outbreaks at slaughterhouses. Worldwide countries are scrambling to find a soft spot between easing lockdown and maintaining their citizens’ safety. All are trying to avoid a deadly second wave of infection.

Both Germany and South Korea have conducted extensive testing and contact tracing and have been praised for avoiding mass deaths. However, even there, authorities are being burdened with the challenge of finding the balance between saving lives and saving jobs.

UPDATE May 9, 10:14 AM EDT: Glimmers of hope surface for U.S. hot spots

In the hard-hit United States, states continue reopening fuelled by some hope that the worst may be over, reported CNN.

""The good news is we're finally ahead of this virus,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a coronavirus briefing Friday. ""We haven't killed the beast, but we are ahead of it.""

It is estimated that of the more than 1.2 million coronavirus cases and over 77,000 deaths in the U.S., New York has carried the brunt of more than 330,000 cases and 26,243 deaths.

But, Cuomo revealed Friday, that death rates for the state are decreasing.

In the meantime, Hawai reported no confirmed cases of coronavirus for the first time since March 13 while Orleans Parish in Louisiana reported no new coronavirus deaths for 2 days in a row.

This hasn’t stopped the country from being at odds with how to handle lockdown measures.

By Sunday, more than 45 states will have eased restrictions in order to allow a return of the economy while protesters are still demanding that businesses put people back to work quicker.

Experts have, however, warned that reopening too soon could lead to another wave of the pandemic. Time will tell how things evolve

UPDATE May 8, 5:34 PM EDT: Roaming 'robodog' tells park goers in Singapore to maintain social distancing

A robot dog enlisted in Singapore to help slow the spread of the coronavirus illness in the small city-state politely asks passersby and cyclists to keep their distance from one another, reports Reuters.

It's a remote-controlled, four-legged machine constructed by Boston Dynamics, and was first deployed in central park last Friday as the beginning of a two-week trial to learn if it may join other already-active robots currently policing visitors of Singapore's green spaces across the locked-down city-state.

""Let's keep Singapore healthy,"" said the black-and-yellow robodog called SOPT in English as it roamed the premises. ""For your own safety and for those around you, please stand at least one meter apart. Thank you,"" it barked, in the soft timbre of a female voice.

However, behind this kind demeanor lies the threat of hefty fines and even jail for those who breach Singapore's strict lockdown measures.

Singapore holds 5.7 million people, with more than 21,000 cases of the coronavirus infection — one of the highest counts in all Asia — mostly due to the rapid spread of infections between migrant workers living in cramped and crowded dormitories within neighborhoods rarely visited by tentative tourists, reports Reuters.

UPDATE May 8, 11:15 AM EDT: Researchers use network science to produce a list of 81 potential COVID-19 therapies

Researchers led by Albert-László Barabási, distinguished university professor at Northeastern University in Boston and the founder of both network medicine and modern network science, used network science to produce a list of 81 drugs used for other diseases that may also treat COVID-19, reported IEEE Spectrum.

“In many ways, the COVID offers a great test for us to marshal the set of highly predictive tools that we as a community [have developed] in the past two decades,” Barabási told IEEE Spectrum.

In cooperation with ten co-authors from Northeastern, Harvard, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Barabási published a pre-print paper of a network medicine-based framework for finding drugs that can be repurposed for COVID-19 use.

The paper has not been submitted for peer-review as the authors are awaiting laboratory results from the 81 potential COVID-19 drugs now being investigated in wet-lab studies. “But we are planning of course to submit it once we have [laboratory] results,” said Deisy Morselli Gysi, a postdoctoral researcher at Northeastern’s Network Science Institute.

Of the drugs identified by the model some are familiar, such as the AIDS-related protease inhibitor ritonavir, but some are entirely new, such as the antibacterial and anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid, with no COVID-19 trials underway.

UPDATE May 8, 10:15 AM EDT: The Executive Committee of The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems released a statement on AI in the COVID-19 era

The Executive Committee of The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems released a statement analyzing how artificial intelligence systems could both help and harm in the COVID-19 days.

“Digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS) can play an important and beneficial role in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. They can help model infection dynamics and socio-economic impact, monitor physical distancing, identify vaccines and help fight disease spread. However, these same technologies can also increase surveillance of individuals and populations and undermine fundamental human values such as privacy and human agency,” read the statement.

The statement went on to explain how important it is to stop the virus without sacrificing our political freedoms. It highlighted the importance of taking advantage of this emerging solidarity brought on by the crisis to build better societies.

The IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems also offered ten responses to address COVID-19 issues: New Metrics of Success, Human Rights, Data Sovereignty, Regulation, Widest Availability, Agile Governance, Values-Based Design, Cultural and Values-based Norms, Manipulation versus “Nudging” in Vulnerable Populations, and Mental Health. Descriptions for each response can be found here.

UPDATE May 8, 10:15 AM EDT: Metal copper being used as a virus-killing coating

Reuters reported that the metal copper, whose antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties have been proven by studies, is now being used as a SARS-CoV-2-killing coating. The firm applying it is called Spee3D.

Spee3D commissioned studies by Melbourne laboratory 360biolabs to examine how the coronavirus responds to copper. They found that 96% of the virus was killed off in two hours and 99.2% in 5 hours.

“Up until the end of last year, our business was building the 3D printers, which were then used to build parts,” Spee3D co-founder Kennedy told Reuters.

“Come 2020, and the epidemic hits. We know about the antimicrobial properties of copper, so we thought ‘Can we do something, can we help out here?’”

UPDATE May 8, 9:15 AM EDT: Porsche Museum opening again

The Porsche Museum will open its doors again on Tuesday, May 12, 2020, according to a press release. To slow the spread of the coronavirus, it's been closed to public visitors since March 14 — eight whole weeks.

The museum will restart operations in line with stipulations from the federal government and the State of Baden-Württemberg to protect everyone from COVID-19 infection. This includes a new guidance system for the entire building to help everyone maintain a minimum distance of 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) between individuals.

""We also provide face masks and disinfectants,"" said Achim Stejskal, Head of Heritage and Porsche Museum. ""We carry out regular occupational safety training for staff relating to hygiene and conduct recommendations."" The number of visitors will also be controlled via entrance limits.

The opening hours will remain unchanged — Tuesdays to Sundays from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM local time. Museum tours and educational programs will however not be offered for the time being, and gastronomic areas will also not be open to the public. ""We are extending the validity of the annual tickets by two months, by the duration of the museum closure during the corona crisis,"" declared Stejskal.

UPDATE May 8, 4:00 AM EDT: WHO situation report

The World Health Organization has launched a checklist to help prison administrators and policy-makers take effective and rapid action against COVID-19, reports the WHO.

WHO is lending support to numerous African countries to help reinforce and coordinate the labor of medical teams (EMTs) deployed to assist efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.

Dr. Hans Henri P. Kluge — WHO Regional Director for Europe — stressed his worry about the rising rate of interpersonal violence amid COVID-19, and added that ""violence is preventable, not inevitable.""

During the third meeting of the International Health Regulations (IHR) Emergency Committee for COVID-19, Director-General of the WHO stressed that the COVID-1 outbreak is still a public health emergency of global concern, and issued the Committee's advice to States Parties as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR.

UPDATE May 7, 11:13 AM EDT: Wearable sensors with pentagon funding to predict coronavirus infections in US military hospitals

The Pentagon is investing in new body-worn sensors designed to identify who is infected with the coronavirus illness — and also those who are at-risk for imminent infection — in U.S. and Southeast Asian hospitals, according to a Businesswire press release.

The new sensors are wrist- or chest-mounted and will use algorithms to analyze human vital sign data to identify key changes that signal early infection.

PhysIQ — a healthtech firm with experience tracking Ebola patients via analytics — leads the initiative that also includes the U.S. Department of Defense, The Henry M.

""The second wave [of the pandemic] is going to come this fall. I'm already hearing people talk about, 'How do I bring my employees back?'"" said physIQ founder Gary Conkright to ABC News. ""We think we're working on a solution to that.""

The project will study the progression of coronavirus infections in those who know they have contracted it, but it could also signal those who've yet to show coronavirus symptoms.

UPDATE May 7, 11:11 AM EDT: The coronavirus is present in semen, raising the question of sexually transmitted COVID-19, says new research

A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medicine Association found the coronavirus present in semen, reports Business Insider. Coronavirus particles were detected in semen samples of men who had active infections, in addition to those who had recovered.

However, this doesn't yet necessarily mean the virus can be sexually transmitted, according to the researchers.

Roughly 16% of men in the study had the virus in their semen.

The 38 semen samples were collected with the help of a team of Chinese researchers, and of the six whose semen had the virus, four were in an acute stage of active infection, and two had already recovered. The six who were confirmed infected range in age from their 20s to their 50s, reports Business Insider.

""There was no significant difference between negative and positive test results for patients by age, urogenital disease history, days since onset, days since hospitalization, or days since clinical recovery,"" wrote the study authors. They added that they don't yet know how the virus entered the testes of patients.

However, the separating barrier between various parts of the penis and the blooostream is imperfect, which means viruses can pass through it. The virus also causes inflammation, which can affect this penis-bloodstream barrier.

THE WASHINGTON POST – At the New Networks for Nature conference in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2017, the renowned Scottish wildlife cinematographer Doug Allan described a pod of beluga whales in the Lancaster Sound of the Canadian Arctic swimming beneath him as he snorkeled at the surface.

After rolling onto their backs so they could look up at him – their eyes are at the bottom of their heads – one of the whales confronted Allan and “scanned” him from head to flipper.

He described how the whale’s melon – the mass of adipose tissue at the front of its head used for echolocation and communication – “appeared to wrinkle in frustration, in exactly the same way your or my forehead might wrinkle in frustration” when encountering a curiosity. Allan then complained that no one has yet managed to understand the whales’ language.

Carl Safina begins Becoming Wild, his luminous meditation on the complexity of contemporary animal culture, in the company of someone attempting to do just that: Shane Gero, a zoologist who has devoted his career to observing and analysing the behaviour of sperm whales.

Safina visits with naturalists who study three species: the sperm whale, the scarlet macaw and the chimpanzee. He drops an intellectual hydrophone into these seemingly disparate pools to see what information he can elicit.

We humans glorify our own culture yet have devoted scant attention to the existence of culture among whales and other species.

Thomas Beale, a surgeon who sailed on a British whaling ship, wrote in his 1839 book, The Natural History of the Sperm Whale, “It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting, and in a commercial point of view of so important an animal, should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited so little curiosity.” Beale was fascinated by the animals’ behaviour. “All sperm whales, both large and small, have some method of communicating by signals to each other, by which they become apprised of the approach of danger,” he wrote. “The mode by which this is effected remains a curious secret.”

For hundreds of years, learning how best to kill the whale has been the extent of our interest in its culture. Safina quotes the pioneering whale researcher Roger Payne to explain the ongoing slaughter of the magnificent creatures, “It’s as if intelligent aliens arrived from outer space and because we couldn’t understand their language, we cooked and ate them.”

Safina demonstrates that the three species studied in Becoming Wild – all of which have life spans not unlike our own – learn how to live their lives through lengthy education from their elders, just as humans do.

Macaws are taught where tasty and nutrition-rich clay lies. Chimpanzees learn which fruit trees are ripening in which order, and even consider changes in the weather when making their calculations.

By destroying the sea beds in our continued search for fossil fuel, and filling the deep with noise from explosives and mechanical drills, we interfere with cetaceans’ delicate echolocation and therefore their ability to orientate themselves, to feed and to communicate.

In wiping out the habitats of the Amazonian scarlet macaw and of the Ugandan chimpanzee, we destroy deep knowledge of vast and complicated landscapes passed down through generations. Orphaned macaw chicks hand-reared and released into the forest lack the cultural knowledge and the dialects of their nest-reared cousins.

In this superbly articulate cri de coeur, Safina gives us a new way of looking at the natural world that is radically different from our usual anthropocentric perspective. Becoming Wild demands that we wake up and realise that we are intrinsically linked to our other-than-human neighbours. We are not alone in loving our families.

Having an aesthetic sensibility, both visual and musical, is both shared and can be perceived by many other species while war-prone humans are not the only ones who would generally prefer to live peaceably with one another.

THE WASHINGTON POST – At the New Networks for Nature conference in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2017, the renowned Scottish wildlife cinematographer Doug Allan described a pod of beluga whales in the Lancaster Sound of the Canadian Arctic swimming beneath him as he snorkeled at the surface.

After rolling onto their backs so they could look up at him – their eyes are at the bottom of their heads – one of the whales confronted Allan and “scanned” him from head to flipper.

He described how the whale’s melon – the mass of adipose tissue at the front of its head used for echolocation and communication – “appeared to wrinkle in frustration, in exactly the same way your or my forehead might wrinkle in frustration” when encountering a curiosity. Allan then complained that no one has yet managed to understand the whales’ language.

Carl Safina begins Becoming Wild, his luminous meditation on the complexity of contemporary animal culture, in the company of someone attempting to do just that: Shane Gero, a zoologist who has devoted his career to observing and analysing the behaviour of sperm whales.

Safina visits with naturalists who study three species: the sperm whale, the scarlet macaw and the chimpanzee. He drops an intellectual hydrophone into these seemingly disparate pools to see what information he can elicit. In doing so, he demonstrates the extent to which different species exhibit cultural behaviours that humans historically have associated exclusively with themselves.

0,"SHANGHAI — In early May, a fleet of yellow bulldozers began flattening a stretch of marshland near the Hangzhou Bay coastline. The team is preparing the ground for a mass tree-planting campaign, which local officials hope will transform the boggy area into a lush cypress forest able to shield the city from typhoon damage.

Zhang Dongsheng is determined to stop them.

The Shanghai-based academic is firmly opposed to the afforestation project, which he describes as “a destruction of the natural ecosystem.” He’s spent weeks trying to convince the local government to abandon its plans, writing articles online and calling the mayor’s hotline.

It’ll be a dead forest. - Zhang Dongsheng, academic

“The reed marshes will be totally destroyed by the tree planting,” the 45-year-old tells Sixth Tone. “It’ll be a dead forest.”

Zhang isn’t the only dissenting voice. The cypress plantation has — perhaps unexpectedly — become a subject of heated debate in Shanghai, with several environmentalists, scientists, and nature lovers speaking out against the plan.

Critics say the wetland currently being bulldozed — Nanhui Dongtan — is a hub of biodiversity with far greater ecological value than the monoculture that will replace it. For many, the project is an example of how green initiatives be counterproductive, as swathes of land are covered with trees without considering the impact on the wider environment.

Nanhui Dongtan is particularly beloved by birders, who consider it irreplaceable. Lying on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway — a major pathway for migratory birds — the wetland is a stopover for over 400 avian species, including endangered shorebirds such as the black-faced spoonbill, Oriental stork, and Japanese night heron.

“Every spring, hundreds of thousands of migratory birds fly northward. The first land (in Shanghai) they see is Nanhui,” says Wang Fang, an ecology researcher at Shanghai’s Fudan University. “It’s one of the most important habitats for them.”

Experts worry draining Nanhui’s wetland will also have other environmental side effects. The reed marshes act as a natural filter removing sediment and toxins from runoff, and as a shield keeping seawater from salinizing freshwater and soil. They also house many native species of fish, frogs, and birds — many of which won’t survive the mass tree planting, according to Wang.

“Fish, toads, and frogs will be gone,” he says. “Birds will be gone.”

But officials in Lingang Special Area, the subdistrict administering the project, are pushing back. From their perspective, Nanhui can’t have outstanding natural value, as — technically speaking — it’s not “natural” in the first place.

“There is no wetland here,” says Sun Donglin, deputy head of ecology and cityscape at the Lingang Special Area Administration. “(It’s) artificial land reclaimed from the ocean and is marked for construction use according to the Shanghai government’s plan.”

Nanhui Dongtan was formed as part of a massive 40 billion yuan ($5 billion) land reclamation project completed in 2006. The move created 133 square kilometers of new land a one-hour drive from downtown Shanghai, which the city converted into an economic zone now known as the Lingang Special Area.

A newly built university cluster, high-end manufacturing base, and artificial lake filled most of the space. But around 10 square kilometers of low-lying terrain was allowed to lie fallow, and the area gradually developed into a wetland ecosystem.

To officials in Lingang, however, the land now being filled with wildlife shouldn’t make it untouchable. Speaking to Sixth Tone in a conference room at the Lingang government offices, it’s clear they have other priorities.

“When we came here in 2006, the place where we’re sitting was surrounded by reeds,” says Sun.

“You say because there are birds living here, we shouldn’t use this whole plot for development and construction. That’s unscientific and unreasonable,” another official adds.

Under the government’s plan, 6,500 mu (4.33 square kilometers) of Nanhui Dongtan will be used to create the cypress forest, with most of the rest earmarked for unspecified future development. Officials have set aside 1.7 square kilometers — roughly one-sixth of the marshes — as a protected wetland park, an amount Sun feels is more than generous.

“It’s already huge to build an ecological park of 1.7 square kilometers in Shanghai, where an inch of land is worth an inch of gold,” says Sun. He adds the government had made the decision as a way to “take into account the interests of a small number of people.”

The concession hasn’t allayed the concerns of Zhang Dongsheng, a keen birder and associate professor of bioinformatics at Shanghai Ocean University. He points out the reclamation project already altered the original ecosystem and removed a significant chunk of the birds’ natural habitat. Removing most of one of the animals’ last remaining havens will make it difficult for them to survive, he adds.

Lingang’s officials, however, insist the benefits of planting the cypress forest far outweigh the costs. The project follows a national plan to build an ecological barrier against typhoons and storm surges on Shanghai’s southeastern shoreline; it replaces degenerated reed marshes — invaded by goldenrod vegetation — with neat lines of trees; and it helps the local government hit its forest coverage quotas.

Local officials across China have been set targets to increase the amount of foliage in their regions, with the country aiming to hit a 26% forest coverage rate by 2035. Nanhui New Town, where the wetland is located, however, is lagging behind the rest of Shanghai and is under pressure to raise its rate from 11.5% to 15.5% by the end of the year.

“To develop the economy and improve the environment, increasing the amount of green space and forest coverage are the two most important measures,” says Sun. “Would you say there are other measures?”

Environmentalists warn that efforts to create artificial forests, while well intentioned, can cause a host of problems. Researchers have found that natural regeneration has been grossly neglected during previous projects in China, while others haven’t been tailored to local conditions.

“Everyone is doing ecological restoration, but there’s a deviation in understanding and sometimes the method used is wrong,” says Wang, the Fudan University researcher. “The ecosystem is a very complicated and precise system. If we change it roughly, it may take a long time and a lot of resources to make up for the loss.”

Nanhui Dongtan is an inhospitable environment for most trees, which will make afforestation efforts challenging, according to Yang Yongxing, a wetland conservation expert at Tongji University.

“The original habitat is coastal salt marshes that are suitable for reeds and other salt-tolerant herbs,” says Yang. “Cultivating trees is theoretically unsuitable.”

A view of the artificial forest and wetland at Nanhui Dongtan, Shanghai, May 15, 2020. Li You/Sixth Tone

The government is trying to overcome the problem by selecting a salt-resistant tree species and clearing out the reed marshes. It will then fill in the land with soil to elevate the ground.

Early results have been mixed. During a visit to Nanhui in May, Wang found that some of the trees planted there over recent years had already died.

Experts are urging the government to classify wetland as green space, so that Nanhui Dongtan can count toward the area’s forest coverage target. Officials in Lingang, however, say they don’t have the power to reclassify land.

“As national servants, we must … consider the overall situation,” Sun says.

Besides, the officials argue, the efforts will be worth it. They’re confident the public will prefer the forest to what it’s replacing.

“To achieve its economic targets, the city has to provide a better environment to attract enterprises and talent,” says Sun. “If you look outside, it’s a wasteland, a field of reeds — can it offer a beautiful environment to the majority of people? Would you like to sit in a forest or a swamp-like space?”

Yet the project’s opponents refuse to concede defeat. Yang Xiaohong, head of research at the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, has called on the local government to release detailed outlines of the tree-planting project for public scrutiny. Others hope Nanhui Dongtan can be given a similar protected status as Chongming Dongtan, a national bird reserve in eastern Shanghai.

Would you like to sit in a forest or a swamp-like space? - Sun Donglin, official

China’s coastal wetlands are among the country’s most threatened ecosystems, yet only one-fifth of them are protected. The lack of concern for wetlands is partly a result of the country’s agricultural legacy, according to Wang.

“Our long and splendid history of agricultural civilization has made us believe that wetlands are wasteland,” says Wang. “This idea was important in history, but today there’ll be a process of gradual adjustment in our understanding … especially when there are water shortages and water becomes a factor restricting economic development.”

There are signs the tide is starting to turn in favor of wetlands. In 2018, the State Council, China’s Cabinet, tightened regulation on land reclamation in a bid to protect coastal wetlands. This year, the Jiusan Society, one of China’s minority political parties, has proposed the government make a special plan for such ecosystems.

But the changes might come too late to save Nanhui Dongtan. As Sixth Tone drives to the wetland, Mao Xianfei, a ride-share driver and Nanhui native, recalls walking for miles through reed fields and green marshes in his youth. Now, he says, the tidal flats where he used to pick shells have all gone, and he’s driving along a road that didn’t exist back then.

When asked his opinion on the new tree-planting project, however, the 40-year-old shrugs. “I personally don’t mind whether there are reeds or forests,” he says. “It all depends on the government’s decision.”

Pelagic birds that spend most of their life in oceans and move towards coasts only to breed have been sighted by the hundreds for the first time in the southern districts of West Bengal after cyclone Amphan battered the region on May 20, bird watchers said.

Amphan, which hit the Sunderbans coast at a speed of 155-165 kmph, carried the birds deep into the mainland with its sheer force, experts said.

The sightings have been recorded by some scientists from the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) and birders in Kolkata, South 24 Parganas, North 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly districts.

Among the pelagic birds sighted are different types of frigatebirds such as the greater, lesser and Christmas frigatebird, Wilson’s storm petrel, sooty tern, lesser crested tern, great crested tern, brown noddy and short-tailed shearwater.

“While terns of some varieties can be spotted in coastal areas where they even feed on freshwater fish, frigatebirds of so many types are never seen in mainland Bengal. Some may not survive the exhaustion and hunger. They cannot find food,” said G Maheswaran, scientist and ornithologist at ZSI. “Some of my colleagues have photographed these frigatebirds,” he added.

“Frigatebirds can survive only in oceans where they dive deep to catch fish. The cyclone surely killed and maimed many of these birds. Had the cyclone hit the coast during the movement of migratory birds from central and south Asia, the devastation would have been severe,” Maheswaran added.

A couple of the birds sighted last week were seen in the past but only in small numbers. According to a research paper published in Indian Birds, the short-tailed shearwater, for example, was recorded for the first time in India in 2013 at Namkhana in the South 24 Parganas.

“While the terns and shearwaters have moved towards the ocean, the frigatebirds are caught in different districts. There are reports of some found by villagers in critical condition. We are preparing reports by crosschecking information with birders in different districts and consulting experts,” said Sujan Chatterjee, secretary of the West Bengal-based Birdwatchers’ Society. “Restriction on movement during lockdown and disruption in telecommunication have made the job difficult,” he added.

A data reviewer for e-Bird in West Bengal, birder Sandip Das said, “For the first time, greater frigatebirds have been spotted at New Town in the eastern fringes of Kolkata. I photographed a few near Bally bridge. Some have been spotted in Hooghly district as well.” Bally bridge connects Kolkata to Howrah.

Swarup Saha, an ardent birder at Batanagar in South 24 Parganas district, visited the local river jetty with his camera on the morning of May 21. “There were a few hundred terns of different types. I could not believe my eyes. The flocks were moving towards the coastline. I spotted around 30 roseate terns among 300-odd bridled terns,” said Saha.

“There have been many cyclones but Amphan was a different experience. Pelagic birds found at Lakshadweep or around the western coast of India have been seen in Bengal for the first time. A fellow birder spotted a Wilson’s storm petrel right here at the Kolkata riverfront. It was beyond imagination,” said Sandeep Biswas, a birder from Dum Dum in the north-eastern fringes of Kolkata.",Amphan carries hundreds of oceanic birds into mainland Bengal; frigatebirds dying of exhaustion and hunger,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEI94t2dnqMHmG5UqavXCLvUqFwgEKg4IACoGCAoww7k_MMevCDCDuK0G?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2020/05/29/Pictures/_8de19d1a-a191-11ea-9c65-1b2d349a0abd.jpg,2020-05-29,"{'sent': 'india\n\n', 'ents': {'GPE': ['india']}}","india

0,"TAIPING: Taiping Zoo and Night Safari ((ZTNS) have scored another success in the breeding of the endangered milky storks in captivity and outside the cages.

ZTNS had released 10 milky storks in 2016 and four birds the next year within the zoo compound. Of the 14, six of them managed to breed in 2018 and 2019.

In a more recent development, Taiping Municipal Council president Khairul Amir Mohmad Zubir said 36 milky storks had made 12 nests in the Hutan Tebing Sungai exhibition area and four of them have shown hatchlings.

“However, the exact number of hatchlings is not yet known,” he said in a statement here on Friday.

He said at the same time, 20 free-ranging endangered milky storks had also made seven nests in the tall trees in the zoo area and two of them contained hatchlings.

“The nests are in good condition and closely monitored by zoo personnel,” he added.

Khairul Amir said the zoo’s conservation programme began in 2005 when the zoo obtained two milky storks from the Jurong Bird Park in Singapore and 10 more from Zoo Negara, Hulu Kelang, here, in 2009.

ZTNS director Dr Kevin Lazarus said the species was classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

He said in Perak, the milky stork, known by its scientific name of Mycteria cinerea, was mostly found in Kuala Gula, Bagan Serai but the species was no longer visible in the area due to the deterioration in the birds’ mangrove forest habitat.

“Its nesting season is between March and July every year, and the birds are highly sensitive and difficult to breed if its habitat is disturbed due to human activity or development.

“The Taiping Zoo and Night Safari will always endeavour to carry out breeding activities, especially of local animal species that are threatened with extinction. We will always play our role in helping the government in breeding, conserving and learning about wildlife in the country,” he added.

The ZTNS has been closed to the public since March 18 following the imposition of the Movement Control Order (MCO). Nevertheless, works to take care of the animals are being carried out according to the stipulated schedule and they are constantly monitored to ensure their well-being. — Bernama",ZTNS successfully breeds endangered milky stork,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJvcm5lb3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjAvMDUvMzEvenRucy1zdWNjZXNzZnVsbHktYnJlZWRzLWVuZGFuZ2VyZWQtbWlsa3ktc3Rvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://www.theborneopost.com/newsimages/2020/05/mco-zoo.gif,2020-05-30,"{'sent': 'Taiping Zoo and Night Safari ((ZTNS) have scored another success in the breeding of the endangered milky storks in captivity and outside the cages.\n\n', 'ents': {'ORG': ['Taiping Zoo', 'ZTNS'], 'PERSON': ['Night Safari']}}","TAIPING: Taiping Zoo and Night Safari ((ZTNS) have scored another success in the breeding of the endangered milky storks in captivity and outside the cages.
